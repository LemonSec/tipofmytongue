1
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:13,410
all right everyone we're gonna get

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:16,289
started okay before I start one quick

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,300
announcement scale another local

4
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:20,369
conference coming up in a few months

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,980
hear their call for papers is open

6
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:25,439
currently so if you're so inclined feel

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,199
free to submit a talk for that I believe

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:31,560
it closes sometime next month so got

9
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,659
about a month to do that all right so

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,819
our next peep speaker has been sadeghi

11
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:37,469
pore bin is the Technical Account

12
00:00:35,819 --> 00:00:38,129
Manager a hacker won by day and a hacker

13
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:41,039
by night

14
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:43,979
prior to joining hacker one yeah great

15
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,510
varied lifestyle prior to joining hacker

16
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:47,460
one he has helped identify and exploit

17
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,989
over 500 security vulnerabilities across

18
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,819
hundreds of web and mobile applications

19
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:52,638
for companies such as Yahoo Airbnb

20
00:00:50,819 --> 00:00:55,799
snapchat the US Department of Defense

21
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:57,479
github and more has also invested time

22
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:59,369
the security community by creating a

23
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,260
community of 200 plus active hackers who

24
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:02,699
share ideas and their experience has

25
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,370
also held a few free workshops to

26
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,890
provide tips and teach others about

27
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:09,270
security and web application hacking

28
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:12,060
please join me in welcoming Vincent

29
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:18,270
Kapoor to shell cotton 2017

30
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:22,960
[Applause]

31
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:25,600
hi everyone could I see me okay cool I'm

32
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:29,080
Ben I've mentioned I work at hacker 1 as

33
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,669
a Technical Account Manager at nights I

34
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,620
try to have a couple of companies here

35
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:35,230
and there I do a lot of I participate in

36
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:38,080
all the bug bounties mostly to stay

37
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:39,640
sharp with skills and some some extra

38
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,580
cash at the end of the night I also was

39
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,900
nice but we won't be pitching you guys

40
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,880
on what bug bounties are today and

41
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,930
mostly talk about my methodology and

42
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,929
some of the things that I've done

43
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:52,570
personally that's made me a couple of

44
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:55,210
bucks if you're a new pen tester you

45
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,649
might pick up some use tricks if you

46
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:58,660
have been doing pen test some of these

47
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:01,690
could be things that are you already

48
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:03,789
using and we'll get into a little bit

49
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:05,679
more so I'll give you guys an overview

50
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,150
of what the talk is I will talk about

51
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,929
the traditional way of how people are

52
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:13,270
doing recon to find assets and just to

53
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:15,610
create a bigger exploitation surface

54
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,260
we'll talk about Amazon Web Services as

55
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,360
a part of that and then we'll move on to

56
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:22,120
search engines and then we'll talk about

57
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:26,380
abuse and github and JavaScript files of

58
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:27,730
JavaScript files as well so why as I

59
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,920
mentioned you find a bigger attack

60
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:33,119
surface you find more bugs you get more

61
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,119
money more problems

62
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:40,190
so brute-forcing traditionally with

63
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,349
trying to find italic surface you run a

64
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:44,420
script there's a handful of them right

65
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:45,799
here you can run all of them you can run

66
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,380
a couple of them depending on your word

67
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,450
list you find subdomains typical

68
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:53,150
patterns you find those patterns you so

69
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:54,980
brute-force them again for example you

70
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:58,250
find a development staging site that's

71
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,899
site dev corporate comm you go after the

72
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,239
quote site calm and you find everything

73
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,430
before that corporate domain but there's

74
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,380
things that have different patterns that

75
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,880
are impossible that impossible but take

76
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:10,850
longer time for this boot force and find

77
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:13,400
them so trying to make it easier we'll

78
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:16,910
get into it as the talk goes on you can

79
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,980
also do Google throwing the site site

80
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:20,450
comm and then take out all the domains

81
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:23,209
that you already know about and it will

82
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:26,780
give you new results so that was a

83
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:28,340
traditional way for me it wasn't working

84
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,860
out it was taking a lot of time was way

85
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:32,720
too slow you can't really automate that

86
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,000
it's automation you can automate it but

87
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,340
it's kind of slow story you missed some

88
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,100
stuff so now why not Bank on human

89
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,720
errors because that easier to find what

90
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,430
do I mean by that so for Amazon Web

91
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,470
Services I'm sure some of you guys are

92
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,209
familiar with s3 buckets you can use

93
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:49,459
Amazon to host or host your files you

94
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:51,709
can point one of your domains to s3

95
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:53,269
bucket but if the human error happens

96
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:54,950
and you forget to claim that s3 bucket

97
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:56,780
someone on the other side as a hacker

98
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:58,608
could claim that as your domain is

99
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,350
pointing to it and up for whatever they

100
00:03:58,609 --> 00:04:02,299
want phishing the time cross-site

101
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:04,519
scripting whatever they wanted to do so

102
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:06,859
how do you find them traditional way

103
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:09,530
again you go to Google you type in sight

104
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:11,359
as s3 on amazon.com that's what it

105
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,889
hosted and then in URL you put the

106
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:14,420
company you're working for so are you

107
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:18,680
looking for so example I'm picking on

108
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:20,000
uber I type that in and it will find a

109
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,680
bunch of patterns and you can also do it

110
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,740
on github you can also automate it as

111
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,710
well so what I mean by that is Google on

112
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:31,160
uber you see there is about 300 and some

113
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:33,289
changed results and on the other side on

114
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:37,580
github I'm looking for Trello which has

115
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:38,960
14,000 hits on just Amazon AWS comm so

116
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,550
you use those combined together you

117
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,229
already have a big enough attacks

118
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,760
but what if they're not hosted on Google

119
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,650
what if it's not indexed on Google what

120
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,510
if it's not indexed on github what if I

121
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:50,030
hasn't been leaked out anywhere else so

122
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:52,250
we go back to boot forcing those how do

123
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:54,169
you do that is you create a list of

124
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,850
supplements that you already have it

125
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,070
could be a traditional list of 400,000

126
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:00,140
names and you add different patterns to

127
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,820
like products staging and development

128
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:05,570
and you automate it and as you go you

129
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:08,690
find more and more so by that you create

130
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:10,640
a bash script you make a make a list of

131
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,870
all those patterns and you feed it all

132
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,539
those supplements that you already have

133
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:15,740
you combine them you run it and as you

134
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,440
run that script it will tell you which

135
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,700
one exists and also could check for

136
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,980
whether or not they're vulnerable so

137
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:24,710
Amazon has a CLI you can you know copy

138
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,910
stuff to s3 bucket you can test and see

139
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:28,159
if it's listing items that are on that

140
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,570
s3 bucket and combining that all in one

141
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,310
script you're already automating it you

142
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,750
don't have to rely on Google your

143
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:37,100
finders can feed it into this as well

144
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:38,150
but it's saving your a lot of time all

145
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,830
the tools that I'll also be talking

146
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:42,679
about are my github you can you really

147
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:43,789
go download them and play around change

148
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,320
them send them back to me we'll push

149
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:47,090
them to my github if you want to

150
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,349
contribute but all these things that I'm

151
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:53,570
going to cover today there will also be

152
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:55,340
on my github page as well so what could

153
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,080
go wrong for me as a bug bounty hunter

154
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,630
if I'm blindly looking for these s3

155
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,570
buckets sometimes somebody could name

156
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:04,159
use the name over in some random bucket

157
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,950
that I don't they don't own it that's

158
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,810
not owned by uber so very technically

159
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,530
stepping out of scope of the program

160
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:13,670
whatever it's a pen test or a bug bounty

161
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:15,200
as I mentioned it could also be a third

162
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:17,690
party app we could have the name ooh BRR

163
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,460
but it's probably not operated or owned

164
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:21,770
by uber it's just being handled or

165
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,960
somebody else so this could be some of

166
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:26,620
the challenges of going and trying to

167
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:30,229
get creative with your recon process

168
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:31,400
good hub most developers here I'm sure

169
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:34,580
you guys all push your code to github

170
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,960
there's also downfalls to that what I

171
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,060
mean by that is you can find more

172
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,799
information about your target you can

173
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:43,340
find all those development staging

174
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:45,290
product environments that are being

175
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:48,590
hidden by someone pushing their code to

176
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:49,760
github we can find secret keys believe

177
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,169
me it happens a lot more than I can

178
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,620
think

179
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:55,840
where people leave their API keys their

180
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,580
passwords secret keys and all that good

181
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,520
stuff I've seen LDAP logins before on

182
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:02,258
github you see the different API points

183
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:05,049
that you wouldn't see within your

184
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:06,610
regular workflow we also understand how

185
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,169
their company is naming those domains

186
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,120
internally and that gives you a huge

187
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:12,068
advantage of finding other domains that

188
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:16,449
could possibly not be behind a firewall

189
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:17,650
and can access them directly so examples

190
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:18,939
for everything that I've talked about I

191
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,549
wanted to include stuff that I've

192
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:22,629
actually been able to do with it and I'm

193
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:25,569
a proven method for it

194
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:27,729
so for the github part I found a Jenkins

195
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:30,759
instance on github by just looking

196
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:32,229
Jenkins on their websites name and ended

197
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:34,210
up not having authentication in front of

198
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:35,889
it at all and then guess what I had I

199
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,229
had all the secret keys and all the

200
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:42,189
building phone I found FTP credentials

201
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:45,128
for a very big company that it's in the

202
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:46,930
crowd so space and they ended up giving

203
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:48,219
me a full FTP access where I could

204
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:51,629
upload a show and do whatever I liked

205
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:54,219
the third one was just internal github

206
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:55,599
credentials where it gave me access to

207
00:07:54,219 --> 00:07:56,830
their internal build services whether

208
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,080
we're hosting all their bills for their

209
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:00,430
mobile apps and stuff like that and some

210
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,169
of the patterns that I've used to find

211
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:03,339
us it's just company name and then

212
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:07,180
putting their keywords and I want

213
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:08,409
password API key you'll be amazed of all

214
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,490
this stuff you find you'll be amazed of

215
00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:15,279
how many people are linking those

216
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:17,740
private keys on github you can also

217
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:19,629
automate a lot of this work people have

218
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:22,029
written tools I get rub you know secret

219
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:24,129
truffle hog get secret whatever it is

220
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:25,689
there's a bunch of tools you can do but

221
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,729
I like to personally do a manual

222
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:30,249
approach that's because if I'm looking

223
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:32,890
for site comm and I put the word

224
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:34,209
password I may not find the password

225
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:37,120
that I want to see maybe the password

226
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:38,739
parameter is blank but there's a chance

227
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,120
that there is some URLs in there that I

228
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:42,010
wouldn't have found if I didn't skim

229
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,448
through the file personally myself so

230
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:44,560
these tools are looking for keywords and

231
00:08:43,448 --> 00:08:46,180
just getting whatever parameter is

232
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,410
whatever the value of that parameter is

233
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,630
and giving it back to you versus

234
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:51,219
analyzing the entire file seeing if

235
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,930
there is any URLs any internal other

236
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,760
stuff the password might be there but it

237
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:56,680
could be named differently with the

238
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,420
parameters are you providing so doing a

239
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:01,000
manual work it may take a lot more time

240
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:03,310
but you get a lot more out of it

241
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,140
you're doing all this by yourself so I

242
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:08,800
don't like to I'm all for automation

243
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:10,900
besides that's part of it so there's

244
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,990
other things that could go wrong I've

245
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:15,370
seen people that have worked at the

246
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,930
company three years ago to put a

247
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:18,130
credential them longer work or if it

248
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,920
works is something personal that they

249
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:22,720
were using it doesn't matter anymore

250
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,000
old keys have expired somebody else has

251
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,590
found them but no one's we did them and

252
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,420
you also can find third-party apps

253
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:30,760
we don't know who's handling it what

254
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:32,140
traffic is going through it and so on

255
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,540
there's been times that I found people's

256
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:36,250
Firefox profiles on github would have

257
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:39,010
all their searches there's been times

258
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:43,180
can find little things that always

259
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:44,920
matter to search engines but search

260
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:47,469
engines I don't mean the typical Yahoo

261
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,870
and google search engines I want to

262
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:52,570
focus more on census showed end and

263
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:54,550
archive data or it could be kind of a

264
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:58,390
search engine and in my favorite one is

265
00:09:54,550 --> 00:10:00,130
search butter the three census showed an

266
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:02,890
and search butter kind of did a similar

267
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:04,510
thing they all look for they all pretty

268
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:06,040
much scan the entire web poll

269
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:09,490
certificates or pull data from those

270
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:11,890
that are scanning unsure then you can

271
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:14,620
find a ton of random stuff a ton of IOT

272
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:16,780
is modems routers whatever I like to use

273
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:21,130
shodhan or sensors and all these other

274
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:23,020
services to find internal IP addresses

275
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:25,030
that it's not accessible by domain but

276
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,140
if you go to the IP I just by itself you

277
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:29,530
can actually load whatever is being

278
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:32,439
hosted on that page so let's talk about

279
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:34,240
census census this is one of the search

280
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,250
that actually worked for me I put the

281
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,370
company's name and I just put the word

282
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:41,350
internal boom they founded internal dev

283
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:43,900
environment and I would have found by

284
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:45,250
just doing a brute force approach you

285
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,079
can just put in the keyword of the

286
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,880
website and nothing else or you can

287
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,950
spend a lot of time like I do and read

288
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,900
the documentation figure out what the

289
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,339
same taxes were census come up with a

290
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:57,339
search query that works for you this

291
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:59,650
one's been doing me a lot of it's been

292
00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:01,600
helpful and it's found me a lot of good

293
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:04,240
stuff that I wouldn't have found as you

294
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,790
can see there is snapchat - payment -

295
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,499
gateway don't snap chat comm something

296
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:11,379
like that I probably wouldn't find out

297
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:15,399
my generic worthless that I host when I

298
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:17,199
do my recon so example actually

299
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:20,619
published this about a month or two ago

300
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:23,649
when I found a Jenkins instance with

301
00:11:20,619 --> 00:11:28,149
snapchat that was accessible within the

302
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:30,189
development environment so when you go

303
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:32,079
to it there was an authentication on

304
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:36,569
there but for some reason my gmail

305
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:39,998
worked it got me in and then it gave me

306
00:11:36,569 --> 00:11:42,429
shell I could actually get that to dump

307
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:44,729
files that I want it unfortunately this

308
00:11:42,429 --> 00:11:46,869
was a very brand-new environment

309
00:11:44,729 --> 00:11:48,189
somebody before me three months before

310
00:11:46,869 --> 00:11:50,199
me actually found the product

311
00:11:48,189 --> 00:11:51,218
environment on the same company and he

312
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:53,468
got 15k for it

313
00:11:51,219 --> 00:11:58,469
same approach three months time their

314
00:11:53,469 --> 00:11:58,469
friends ten thousand dollar difference

315
00:11:59,729 --> 00:12:04,419
show then kind of the same approach

316
00:12:01,979 --> 00:12:07,779
showed unless you do a lot of filtering

317
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:10,718
and one of you says I use it you can

318
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:12,729
either look for a port so if you're

319
00:12:10,719 --> 00:12:15,699
looking for Tomcat instances you can use

320
00:12:12,729 --> 00:12:17,499
the eight 443 and give it the product

321
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:19,209
for Tomcat if you want to just look for

322
00:12:17,499 --> 00:12:21,819
any if you want to look for the org so

323
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:24,608
example if Yahoo owns an entire IP space

324
00:12:21,819 --> 00:12:25,929
put in or get calls org equals Yahoo it

325
00:12:24,609 --> 00:12:28,749
will pull all the IP edges that are

326
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:30,039
being owned by Yahoo so he does a lot of

327
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:33,609
filtering there is a really good book

328
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:36,209
that the founder of shorten actually

329
00:12:33,609 --> 00:12:38,379
published himself it's five bucks but

330
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:39,819
the five bucks is a very good investment

331
00:12:38,379 --> 00:12:41,769
if you actually spend the time to

332
00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:43,449
understand how these queries are working

333
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:45,159
how you can filter them out and how you

334
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:46,929
can find it data let's talk about

335
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:50,649
examples

336
00:12:46,929 --> 00:12:54,329
I got again RabbitMQ had access to the

337
00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:56,409
internal servers so I initially found a

338
00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:58,449
content management system I want to call

339
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:59,829
it so I don't just close the name that

340
00:12:58,449 --> 00:13:01,089
had a lot of log files in it there

341
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:05,348
wasn't a different port so it was maybe

342
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:06,309
port 8081 for example how interesting so

343
00:13:05,349 --> 00:13:09,879
let's go ahead and search the same

344
00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:12,759
domain and put in a port number 15 672

345
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:13,899
which is a bit MQ I found the open port

346
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:15,279
going through all the laws from the

347
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:17,960
other content management system

348
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:20,540
I found credentials which got access

349
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:23,000
the RabbitMQ instance again although

350
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:25,550
jenkins instance that similar to the one

351
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,450
that I showed earlier same thing you go

352
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,099
on a showdown you type in an

353
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:29,930
organization or we can use the host team

354
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:32,270
actually for this one I put host name

355
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:33,620
equals a company name calm cool there's

356
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:36,650
a Jenkins instance just sitting there

357
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:38,830
out of the open and most of the time not

358
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:41,329
sure why I don't require authentication

359
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:43,730
so that's easy money for people that are

360
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:48,620
trying to find vulnerabilities on your

361
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:52,160
infrastructure going a little too fast

362
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:56,510
search powder is another one they have a

363
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:59,870
very good API but the API is very very

364
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:01,910
messy it gives you a lot of data that

365
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:03,710
you don't need but you can always

366
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:05,920
automate that it's all in JSON you can

367
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:09,200
always feel feed it to a third-party

368
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:12,469
tool you can automate all that work and

369
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,720
feed it to different tools so let's talk

370
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:16,730
about that a little bit

371
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:19,010
again great API so what I'm doing is I

372
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,000
have an alias I'm actually making all

373
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:21,830
these things that I've built that

374
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,420
requires commands I build them into a

375
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:26,180
batch alias for myself so I don't have

376
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:29,180
to think of what the syntax was how to

377
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:30,800
write it or what the you know how to get

378
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:33,140
that JSON format to look a little bit

379
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,319
prettier on the right side so again I'm

380
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:38,810
calling I'm curling to search powder I'm

381
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,150
feeling it - JQ it's making it nice and

382
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:44,150
easy for me and it gives me the list on

383
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:47,000
the right and some of these ones like CC

384
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:48,290
Corp no way I would have found it I'm

385
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,400
not looking for that kind of wording and

386
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:55,490
my boot my boot force the other one that

387
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,930
I've I'm not really a big nmap kind of

388
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:58,340
person I don't really do port scanning

389
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,290
I've shortened I don't have to spend a

390
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,580
lot of time but some of these things you

391
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:03,920
can't find them on Showtime for some

392
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:06,290
reason can also feed it to a map I can

393
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,329
filter in maps so same thing as the one

394
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:10,640
above I'm just giving it a pipe within

395
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:13,940
my finger to end map and doing some port

396
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:16,400
scanning I also have another one that

397
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:20,120
it's not up here but I've also gone as

398
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:22,790
far as adding a directory brute force so

399
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,070
I spent five dollars and get a server

400
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:27,560
somewhere that's hosted for me I put

401
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:28,999
this bash alias in there I run

402
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,069
we're on the same script guessing all

403
00:15:28,999 --> 00:15:33,410
these domains jumping into a foul

404
00:15:31,069 --> 00:15:35,479
the next command takes a file feed it to

405
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:36,589
my directory boot for sure and then it

406
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,319
starts looking for all these different

407
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:41,089
folders I exists on that so you can find

408
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:44,860
get repositories on there you can find

409
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:47,329
admin panels you can find folders that

410
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:49,339
then you want to find us fast as you can

411
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:51,739
so for me if I've know 100 so 100

412
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:53,600
domains that I want to route force I can

413
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,189
just feed that through the server that

414
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,689
I'm hosting elsewhere I'll go grab

415
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:58,849
dinner do whatever grab a couple drinks

416
00:15:56,689 --> 00:16:00,230
come back in a couple of hours all this

417
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:01,399
games are done appropriately I go

418
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,680
through all of them look at the response

419
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:05,509
headers okay how big the files are and

420
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:12,489
analyze them and then take it out attack

421
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:14,269
surface further javascript files

422
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:16,189
javascript files have been something

423
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:22,129
that I have been personally focused on a

424
00:16:16,189 --> 00:16:24,199
lot more lately Airbnb has been the

425
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:26,389
biggest target they've been very nice to

426
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:29,628
me in that let me experiment with a lot

427
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:31,699
of their applications I don't say nobody

428
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:32,870
from Airbnb here but Nate and Max have

429
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:35,508
been very nice to let me actually talk

430
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:37,100
about these publicly I've also written

431
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:39,259
about this on my blog we can check him

432
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:43,189
out online but both of those

433
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:45,079
vulnerabilities were pretty important to

434
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:46,730
them well the first one was I could

435
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:50,709
pretty much see anybody's notification

436
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:53,029
sent to my phone my second one was a

437
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:55,008
seraph where it gave me access to the

438
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:57,889
internal network but how did I find them

439
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:59,629
I didn't find him by my usual clicking

440
00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:02,240
around seeing what burp is giving me

441
00:16:59,629 --> 00:17:05,049
some of these endpoints aren't even the

442
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,949
developers don't even exist because

443
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:10,280
different teams push different code

444
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:12,829
different files are being worked with by

445
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,109
other people on the team so how can I

446
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:17,500
find all of these in one place and go

447
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:17,500
through them

448
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:25,099
sorry this is another tool it's called

449
00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:28,069
GES parser and what it does is it's kind

450
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:29,570
of a search engine what it you can do is

451
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:32,090
you can give it a list of JavaScript

452
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:33,559
files I mean if you give it a 50

453
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:35,509
megabyte file it's not going to do well

454
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:38,570
but it might take a while but if you

455
00:17:35,509 --> 00:17:40,519
give it 20 30 decent-sized JavaScript

456
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:42,710
files it would go through every single

457
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:44,149
line find all the end points that are

458
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:47,269
making some sort of a get post put

459
00:17:44,149 --> 00:17:49,070
request highlights it for you and you

460
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:51,230
can check them out so for Airbnb this

461
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:52,908
worked out pretty well because I was

462
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:54,830
artists saving all the JavaScript files

463
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:56,570
on the notepad and I know they're

464
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:58,100
constantly pushing new features right so

465
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,389
how do I monitor that without going to

466
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,668
the website and clicking on everyday

467
00:17:59,389 --> 00:18:04,370
you're on one of these I think I run one

468
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:06,429
of these every week on Airbnb now when

469
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:09,439
they give me pretty much every endpoint

470
00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:10,850
ID if the current one with the past one

471
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,740
I see what's different what's been added

472
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:14,120
to it and then I ping get him in Assam

473
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,230
do you guys know this exists and if they

474
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,908
don't it's a good thing for me that

475
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:19,490
means their pen test team or the

476
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:21,529
cubicles have looked at it I go in and

477
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:23,840
look at it and that would be the result

478
00:18:21,529 --> 00:18:25,340
of it both of those were found by chance

479
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,830
for sir

480
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:30,320
the hardest part is to actually fuzz and

481
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:34,009
find those parameters but Airbnb loves

482
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,509
giving really a lot of content and a lot

483
00:18:34,009 --> 00:18:36,529
of errors as you go through the API so

484
00:18:35,509 --> 00:18:37,639
if you give them the wrong parameter

485
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:39,379
back oh no no no that's not what you

486
00:18:37,639 --> 00:18:41,240
want these are the parameters that you

487
00:18:39,379 --> 00:18:43,129
could use and you give the parameter the

488
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,809
wrong input it's like no no no no no you

489
00:18:43,129 --> 00:18:48,320
only have these four options which one

490
00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:49,700
do you want to use so it works with me

491
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,000
it works with them they're happy with it

492
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:55,190
so why not build a tool around there so

493
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,629
how do you find all these JavaScript

494
00:18:55,190 --> 00:19:03,559
files archive.org time machine people

495
00:18:59,629 --> 00:19:05,330
call it there is websites from a few

496
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,049
thousand maybe a little earlier I don't

497
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:08,120
go that far

498
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:09,559
but you can't go ahead and find all

499
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,719
these JavaScript files that were hosted

500
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:13,309
five years ago six years ago actually

501
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,960
there's a script for it also somewhere I

502
00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:17,480
don't have that on my slides but you

503
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,269
pretty much put the side in let's just

504
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:22,460
pick on Airbnb you go to a time machine

505
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:24,049
you click on five years ago

506
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,530
you click on it it has all the comment

507
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:26,330
that was on

508
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:28,399
five years ago hosted on our countdown

509
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:29,990
org you look at the source you pulled

510
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,510
the JavaScript files you go back to J's

511
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:33,860
far sir and some of the most other times

512
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:35,240
those endpoints that were used five

513
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,429
years ago were just forgotten about

514
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,830
someone did this project worked on it

515
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:43,340
and then just left and left the files

516
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:46,790
behind to archive that work it's not

517
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:47,570
really a search engine but it comes in

518
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:49,730
very handy

519
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:51,080
so for develop for people that are doing

520
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,880
development I always say if you're not

521
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,830
using an endpoint if it's old please

522
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,000
delete it or it's going to cost you a

523
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:58,310
lot of money if you're running a bug

524
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,720
bounty and if you're not it's gonna cost

525
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:05,090
you a lot more headache and money than

526
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:07,670
just spark my honeys and the reason why

527
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:09,439
is the J's foster thing is beside the

528
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:12,530
endpoints in JavaScript I've seen people

529
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:15,890
have a bad habit of putting hard core

530
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:18,080
credentials no idea why but I've seen

531
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:19,940
people actually type into AWS keys in

532
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,399
the JavaScript files I've seen people

533
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:24,500
put in credentials for some reason you

534
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,180
can grab those you can also find

535
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:29,060
internal subdivers it may be making a

536
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:30,860
call to another domain snapchat there's

537
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:34,159
a new snapchat home for example for

538
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:35,540
there and all of the API calls right so

539
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,100
if you go pull out some of the

540
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:38,870
JavaScript files from a bean from

541
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,699
snapchat and you put them into jails

542
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:43,729
partial it's going to give you all these

543
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:45,110
different end points but at the same

544
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:46,820
time if you look a little bit deeper you

545
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,530
will see that these random subdomains

546
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,750
and domains are hosted someone really

547
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:53,690
weird on a google something we maybe

548
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:55,400
Google cloud or it could be on snapchats

549
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:57,170
internal domains that you could never

550
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,260
find unless you're actually going

551
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:02,090
through the JavaScript files and again I

552
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:04,010
do that because it finds me more bugs

553
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:08,179
gives me more money getting more

554
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:10,670
problems before I do go away we are

555
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:12,920
doing a giveaway our hacker one booth I

556
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:14,810
have the first person to raise their

557
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:20,990
hand and answer this question would win

558
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:22,010
a phantom 3 drone so first person I get

559
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:23,810
that resident gave me the right answer

560
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:26,390
could come up and grab it

561
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:28,700
how cool one has just recently partnered

562
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:30,050
up with a big company for a project that

563
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,620
we launched today does anyone know what

564
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:32,620
company that is

565
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:39,620
yes so we're doing blood banks for

566
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:41,150
Google if you're if you're good at

567
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:44,030
mobile hacking I know better to talk

568
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:46,550
today about finding bugs on mobile apps

569
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:48,740
if you find a decent bug it's if you

570
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:51,169
find a bug that could affect the actual

571
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,610
mobile application and the workflow not

572
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:54,200
only the company would pay you if you

573
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:56,149
submit it to Google itself they would

574
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,880
give an extra thousand dollars as a part

575
00:21:56,150 --> 00:22:00,590
of a partnership with hacker one so you

576
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,120
can go out and go on a hacker down acha

577
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:05,300
1.com and figure out where to submit

578
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,979
them I know I did I went a little too

579
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,730
fast but I'd be more than happy to take

580
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,730
some questions as well

581
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:36,300
you see something you did many do

582
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:38,280
Kirsten if you see something at first it

583
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,780
was all manual I did a lot of manual

584
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,639
work and I realize some of these things

585
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:44,730
I'm doing to be written in one line of

586
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:47,400
bosch but I've had the data to see which

587
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:49,230
ones are good to demand to automate and

588
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:52,170
which ones if you're looking for certain

589
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:53,810
things within a foul it's a lot of

590
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:56,940
things but if you're looking for a

591
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:58,649
specific piece of info automation always

592
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,630
works and I don't mean by automation I

593
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:02,390
write almost everything in Bosch besides

594
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:05,220
the bigger projects that we've published

595
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:06,960
one or two lines of Bosch always helps

596
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,670
and most of the time it's gonna be in my

597
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:13,500
earliest magog's actually got my github

598
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:14,970
I think I call it a recon profile I

599
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,670
believe they have all these different

600
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:19,530
areas are created it's just it could be

601
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:21,000
as easy as doing a who is on an IP I can

602
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:23,970
just look up Buda IP I just belongs to

603
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,200
but typing curl sub domain and then the

604
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:29,840
domain and the IP takes a long time

605
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,840
versus saying IP info IP

606
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:41,360
is it basically just kind of Bureau

607
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:44,139
instinct that tells you that all the

608
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,139
state of the feedback

609
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:50,129
so for most of the automation for

610
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:52,110
example when I do automation on the s3

611
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:53,460
bucket so when it says testing it

612
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:54,360
doesn't give me an error more unlucky

613
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,040
doesn't exist

614
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,120
but if it's something that exists you

615
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,610
don't have access we'll give you the

616
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,050
error that prints for you if it exists

617
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:03,540
and you can actually explore it it will

618
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:06,240
try and export it for you again these

619
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:06,750
are just things that it's built into AWS

620
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,750
CLI

621
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:10,830
but it's not an AWS fault it's not it's

622
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,660
not on Amazon's fault

623
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:14,399
it's where was configuring this s3

624
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,060
bucket or these instances that I'm

625
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,280
making a mistake

626
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:19,050
so doing that it just prints out the

627
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,550
area just try the exact command the CLI

628
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:22,620
is supposed to do and gives the result

629
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:23,850
for it so I try to make sure that the

630
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,590
one thing that are the biggest thing

631
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:27,689
that I focus on is the response order

632
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:29,250
what it comes back and how big the file

633
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:31,770
is if it's just every file is giving us

634
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:33,270
200 with the same amount of info on it

635
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,280
that means there's false positive but if

636
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:36,870
I'm getting to hundreds and like some of

637
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,370
them have 800 you know somebody's like

638
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:41,689
900 thousand then I know there's

639
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:41,689
different files that's actually a girl

640
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:51,610
I know Microsoft does offer a bug bounty

641
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:59,610
program but I've not looked at him at

642
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:59,610
all crime once twice

643
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:07,570
[Music]

644
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:09,370
if you go to the home set would be on

645
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:10,510
Twitter get how I know there so should

646
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:21,399
maybe want to get ahold of me will be

647
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:23,090
that also my email for Gmail alright

648
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:31,019
round of applause for Ben

649
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:33,609
[Applause]

650
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:34,599
just remind everyone if you like what

651
00:25:33,609 --> 00:25:36,369
you saw please let us know what you

652
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:38,019
thought grab one of these cards in the

00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:39,579
back and fill it out for the talks
