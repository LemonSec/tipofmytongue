1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,760
okay so you know starting next talk as

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,769
the leader of the red as the lead Red

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,540
Team engineer at palo alto networks pj

4
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:14,130
is an information security expert who is

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,079
focused on ensuring the security of the

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,880
company's infrastructure over the years

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,270
pj has had the opportunity to present

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,640
her work at several street conferences

9
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:28,019
thank you hello everyone

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,490
oh good because I was trying gloves

11
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,619
looking around the room like looking at

12
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,589
the sea of faces and I got this

13
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:36,930
overwhelming sense that feeling or

14
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:41,340
thought I guess that like what a

15
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:43,379
wonderful time this is for a nap maybe

16
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:47,940
I'm just projecting I don't know this

17
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:50,250
week guys are in the chair so I'm PJ or

18
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,230
project Patrick I if anybody is

19
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:55,559
adventurous enough to pronounce that I

20
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:59,099
work with Palo Alto Networks raise your

21
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:01,800
hands if you guys know about the company

22
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,010
what we do okay awesome there was not

23
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:08,189
really follow up with that question I

24
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:11,400
joined the team the red team really

25
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:14,100
about just over a year ago to kind of

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,229
build a structured program for

27
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,780
performing red teaming activities at the

28
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:22,890
company targeting just the Palo Alto

29
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:26,939
Networks infrastructure we don't do that

30
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:28,829
for customers or anything but the

31
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,079
session is just primarily gonna be like

32
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:37,139
a process story about building that

33
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:38,070
program I guess afternoons are not my

34
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,340
most productive times

35
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,350
so when afternoon afternoon for some

36
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,649
reason I thought like wonder if there is

37
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:51,179
a song about cybersecurity so I googled

38
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:53,310
it and sure enough there is a well not a

39
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,329
song but at least lyrics to a song I

40
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,619
don't know if anybody has actually

41
00:01:54,329 --> 00:02:00,630
recorded the song but it's called cyber

42
00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:04,579
crying and it's penned by Steve Morgan

43
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:07,289
and CSO online article he mentions that

44
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:09,389
for him this is kind of a battle cry for

45
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:15,510
cyber security defenders or cyber

46
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:17,849
defenders the last two lines of this

47
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:20,399
worse this is not the entire song it's

48
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:23,450
just a particular words that I chose to

49
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,610
include here the last two lines really

50
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:29,609
he's putting a big question mark against

51
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:32,790
the state of cyber security or cyber

52
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,629
defenses and how effective they are and

53
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:38,609
this is going somewhere

54
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:39,170
I promise so I got just thinking about

55
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:43,280
it

56
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:45,720
this January of 2018 I'm gonna be

57
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:50,790
completing 11 years in this profession

58
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:54,269
as a full-time member not a long time at

59
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:58,260
the same time quite a long time the

60
00:02:54,269 --> 00:03:01,920
field has changed so much dare I say

61
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:04,349
evolved so much I started him on the

62
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,238
application side of things at a time

63
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:08,518
when everything was about border

64
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,349
protection like talking to people who

65
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,640
relied on firewalls and trying to

66
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:13,859
explain to them what this application

67
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,970
security was and why should they care

68
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:22,140
about it that was quite a challenging

69
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:23,940
task but now that I think about it it

70
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,579
feels like my career has really come

71
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:30,989
full circle because now I'm at a company

72
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:35,040
that I guess depends a lot and

73
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:37,440
understanding application context so

74
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:42,989
that their technology can effectively

75
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:44,250
prevent against cyber attacks so quite a

76
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:45,569
lot of things have changed and that's

77
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,090
only on the technology side

78
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:51,329
I haven't had most of my career has been

79
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:53,879
on the product research side only in the

80
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:56,640
past few years I've been you know a

81
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:59,939
member of the enterprise security kind

82
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,970
of realm and things have changed a lot

83
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:05,129
as well so for organizations that

84
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:07,830
actually have the budget the functions

85
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:10,560
that are being now included in a

86
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:14,209
infrastructure stuff like social

87
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,728
engineering training stuff like in

88
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:18,470
security awareness for employees threat

89
00:04:16,728 --> 00:04:21,320
intelligence these are the things that

90
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:24,500
we are looking at and this is quite a

91
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:28,030
bit of change from just a few years ago

92
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:34,610
and pen testing is not an exception

93
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:36,440
either when I join the team there was

94
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,870
already there were a couple of or there

95
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,690
are still a couple of pen testing

96
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:45,350
functions within the company so the

97
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:47,090
first question was well why do we need a

98
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:50,800
red teaming function again how is it

99
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:50,799
different from pen testing and

100
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:56,570
conceptually it's really not there's

101
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,960
very little that's actually different

102
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:03,500
from between pen testing and and red

103
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:05,270
teaming the first definition is pen

104
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,430
testing the second one is more of an

105
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:10,219
army definition of red teaming but if

106
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:15,110
you apply it to IT or the technology

107
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:16,789
field they're kind of the same the area

108
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,590
where they started kind of drifting

109
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:22,909
apart at least in the enterprise world

110
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:28,159
is pen testing has kind of taken a bit

111
00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:31,639
more of a focused up stance I guess so

112
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:34,840
today any mature enforcer Corgan ization

113
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:37,460
is wants to work closely with

114
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,349
application developers with the

115
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:43,070
engineers to make sure that pen testing

116
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:45,530
is part of their steel sea process so

117
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:49,310
anytime as of anytime a new application

118
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:51,979
version is released or built people want

119
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:53,690
to make sure that pen testers are

120
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:56,210
hammering away at finding every single

121
00:05:53,690 --> 00:06:01,180
vulnerability they can fix it before it

122
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:05,448
goes it goes like same thing with

123
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:07,639
network or system side when testing is

124
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:11,060
becoming a part of the change management

125
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:13,009
piece like anytime you deploy a new

126
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,229
infrastructure you deploy a new system

127
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:21,080
they want some pen testing to be done on

128
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:23,029
it so it's becoming more of a fine

129
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,690
everything we can for a particular

130
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:27,790
target which is amazing I feel like it's

131
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:30,520
the right direction

132
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:32,530
but that leaves a gap which is what's

133
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,690
the big picture how do we do the reality

134
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:37,299
check right fine all of your pieces

135
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:38,890
might be doing the right things but it's

136
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:42,100
the whole really get greater than it

137
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:43,750
than kind of the sum of the parts if you

138
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,820
have ten applications and if you have

139
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:48,700
secured all the ten applications does

140
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:51,330
that mean that you are now immune to

141
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:55,229
cyber attacks who answers that question

142
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:57,520
that's what the red team does the

143
00:06:55,230 --> 00:07:00,910
application security program doesn't

144
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:04,180
care if I saw if I fix all my bugs in

145
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:06,250
this app or if I let's say leave one of

146
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:10,360
the bugs open in one of my applications

147
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:11,830
how does that interplay with an employee

148
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,720
being phished for some important

149
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:17,050
information in HR which ultimately

150
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:20,430
results in the theft of you know your

151
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:22,840
secret cookie recipe or something

152
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,340
panda sing functions today in the

153
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,979
enterprise don't really try to answer

154
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:29,770
that question because they have other

155
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:34,810
things to do and red teaming in my

156
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:38,469
opinion is what that what that question

157
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:41,320
is for or who that question is for so

158
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:42,970
with that kind of and this these were

159
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,520
the conversations I was having with the

160
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:46,870
leadership in the infrastructure

161
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,310
organization because there was a lot of

162
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,960
confusion about what what the

163
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:53,080
differences are all so with that

164
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:55,120
actually squared away the next question

165
00:07:53,080 --> 00:08:01,240
was okay this is what we have to do how

166
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:03,130
are we gonna do it so one day one of my

167
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,370
senior directors came and say I need a

168
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:08,830
cable for red teaming I said okay you

169
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:13,120
gotta never really created a playbook

170
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:14,409
for anything so I googled you know

171
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,060
football playbooks because that's the

172
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:18,550
only really context I know for playbooks

173
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,080
and I started reading through some of

174
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:21,340
the online versions and they talked

175
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,810
about it and I know nothing about

176
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:26,849
American football or any kind of

177
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:29,110
football really so it was very confusing

178
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:31,420
but I was trying to apply that to like

179
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:33,909
Red Team a and I said well should I

180
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:38,349
start creating plays where like I if I

181
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:41,390
know all the defense tactics that my my

182
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:45,020
company has what are all the offensive

183
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:47,120
that I can execute and then see how have

184
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:51,829
taken me forever to do all that so I

185
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:54,380
change gears a little bit the PlayBook

186
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:57,440
that I created what I wanted it to be

187
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:59,990
was that's if somebody comes joins the

188
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,400
team they have they have had some

189
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,980
fantastic experience you know the

190
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:07,579
technical know-how but they need to know

191
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:10,640
well how do I even go about planning a

192
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:12,800
Red Team exercise how do i cute it how

193
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,420
do I inform the right stakeholders what

194
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,740
who are the stakeholders what are their

195
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,199
roles what are their responsibilities

196
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,670
there's so many questions that need to

197
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,820
be answered when you are actually

198
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:28,270
planning an attack against your own

199
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:31,090
company so I wanted the PlayBook to be

200
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:33,410
the piece that answers those questions

201
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:35,420
you take that that's the Bible you take

202
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:38,630
that and you go through the framework

203
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:44,839
that's defined in that playbook and you

204
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:48,380
know you succeed so we did create a

205
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:50,090
playbook and I wish I had I could

206
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,830
release it today to you guys a general

207
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:54,590
version not not a company specific

208
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:56,930
version but it's not there yet but I can

209
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:58,940
give you what I've already kind of

210
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,439
covered some of the pieces it basically

211
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,570
first of all defines what redeeming

212
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,430
means to us as a company it defines what

213
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:07,250
the roles responsibilities who the

214
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:09,680
stakeholders are it defines a five stage

215
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:12,590
approach to how the whole the entire

216
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,810
point is red teaming is about big

217
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:17,480
objectives at least for an enterprise

218
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:22,250
it's not about go own that system that's

219
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:26,810
not red teaming the goal is I don't know

220
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:28,690
steel code or inject your own code how

221
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:32,150
would you go about it

222
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:33,500
so taking something of a broad objective

223
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:35,120
like that and breaking it into pieces

224
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:38,630
where you can actually then come up with

225
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,730
attack scenarios and attack plans that's

226
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,960
what the PlayBook is about and so we

227
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:43,730
have defined like a five stage approach

228
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,290
that goes first a subjective selection

229
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:47,710
who needs to actually decide what the

230
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:50,630
objective is for a particular exercise

231
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:52,820
going investigating that objective we

232
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:55,100
don't go at least we as a red team don't

233
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:58,160
really adhere to

234
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,720
the zero knowledge can approach because

235
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,969
it's just impossible to do is we are

236
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,880
inside the company and you're gonna know

237
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:06,079
things but you still need to do some

238
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,029
investigation some open source

239
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,609
intelligence gathering something to

240
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:12,800
really understand what needs to be what

241
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:15,470
the target targets need to be either

242
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,189
people processes systems to actually get

243
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:21,740
to that objective so how do you go about

244
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:25,069
inspecting that then comes exercise

245
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:27,769
planning and this is a key piece like we

246
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:32,240
fall under the circuits team the

247
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:34,880
security operations team so the director

248
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,370
of that function needs to know what we

249
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,930
are going to do so that we don't end up

250
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:42,230
waking up our CEO in the middle of the

251
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:44,149
night because we created an incident so

252
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:47,690
they need to know what the exercise plan

253
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:51,589
is and why are we going after certain

254
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:54,079
targets and then its execution pieces

255
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:57,170
the most fun piece also the easiest to

256
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:59,660
actually tackle and then comes

257
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:05,870
post-mortem so that's basically how it

258
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:09,199
goes it's been it was a it was actually

259
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:11,149
a fun task to create that thing but once

260
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:12,620
it was there obviously we went through

261
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:14,810
reviews you know everybody had their

262
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:18,680
feedback but the real way to actually

263
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:21,410
test it out was to conduct to use it to

264
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:25,040
planning an exercise and we did that we

265
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:27,529
did use it kind of to go to guide and

266
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,120
external or a Red Team exercise

267
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:31,699
conducted by an external partner of ours

268
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,699
we used it to conduct one internally and

269
00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:36,529
it worked out brilliantly obviously but

270
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:38,630
there were a few things here and there

271
00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:41,029
are tweaks that we needed to make things

272
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:42,620
that are missed for instance you know I

273
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:44,899
forgot to define the rules of engagement

274
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:49,279
which is kind of a key piece to any red

275
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:51,050
team really assessment what is allowed

276
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:54,290
what is not allowed things like that but

277
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:56,630
a you know - those are those little

278
00:12:54,290 --> 00:13:01,040
things here and there it worked out

279
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:03,350
great which is amazing with that done

280
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,599
with a clear with clarity around what

281
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:07,520
the program is how we're going to do it

282
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,740
I was trying to get tactical

283
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:13,040
and there are a few pieces to

284
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:17,720
operationalizing

285
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:19,430
a any writing program tooling there's

286
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,750
nothing really to do there you don't

287
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:22,370
need to reinvent the wheel there's a

288
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:24,589
whole bunch of stuff out there I mean

289
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:29,770
just listening to you know where does

290
00:13:24,589 --> 00:13:32,330
the stock get like 150 different ideas

291
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:35,569
there's a infrastructure piece which is

292
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:37,130
a key piece especially since it's been

293
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:38,450
used for offensive stuff you really

294
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:40,220
don't want anybody getting in there and

295
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:42,860
then using it for their own benefit

296
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:46,490
without you knowing about it

297
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:50,630
there's the training piece for the red

298
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:52,730
teamers really Wow okay how do you

299
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,779
actually how do you all these things are

300
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:55,339
good but how do you measure your

301
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:57,709
coverage how do you know your tooling is

302
00:13:55,339 --> 00:14:00,740
good how do you know your talent is good

303
00:13:57,709 --> 00:14:03,109
right so the the thing that we have

304
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,640
focused recently on is actually building

305
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:06,230
frameworks that allow us to do that

306
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,630
measurement like metrics was the most

307
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:13,670
challenging aspect of the PlayBook for

308
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:16,209
me and the first like pass that we are

309
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:20,660
taking at it is through modeling of

310
00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:22,849
TTP's tactics well technique tactics

311
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:26,839
techniques and procedures and the

312
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:29,180
inspiration came from stuff like what

313
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:35,420
mitre is doing through their attack

314
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:37,729
metrics through their car framework and

315
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:40,699
this is basically it connects all the

316
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:42,980
things we know about campaigns to the

317
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,810
TTP's they're using which is amazing

318
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,100
that's exactly what I want but I want to

319
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:48,319
be able to control it I want to be able

320
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:50,600
to use it not not just for planning but

321
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,190
for tracking against it which TTP's we

322
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,860
have we used before have they succeeded

323
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:56,329
have they failed I don't want to be

324
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,640
picked I don't want to continue using

325
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:59,449
the same TTP's over and over again

326
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:02,329
because that doesn't help the

327
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:04,579
organization get any better so keeping

328
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:06,319
track of that was essential but none of

329
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:09,199
the existing ones really helped us a

330
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:12,260
whole lot so we created our own kind of

331
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,329
this was the first version it doesn't

332
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:17,779
really there's a reason it's very blurry

333
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:20,319
and whatnot but it it basically is just

334
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:23,260
a conceptual map of all the TTP's

335
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,060
that we know about in general and we

336
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:28,439
just have a bunch of features there that

337
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:31,540
we can use to actually track across that

338
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,730
knowledge base that we have of TTP's all

339
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:36,660
the stuff that I just mentioned a minute

340
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:40,210
ago the one question that comes up is

341
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:43,060
Red Team Blue Team a lot of times we

342
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:44,500
kind of keep our operation secret so

343
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,859
that we want to test our response

344
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:49,960
readiness in a realistic fashion and I

345
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:51,010
get asked why are y'all so secretive

346
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:54,580
about it you know why can't you just

347
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:57,610
tell us and it's a valid question it's

348
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:58,900
it's not we're not trying to you know be

349
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:00,790
confrontational we're not trying to say

350
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:03,340
you suck or whatever it is blue team

351
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:05,410
right we want to work together because

352
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:09,430
we are heading towards the same goal

353
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:10,780
so purple teaming I hope at least some

354
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,189
of you guys might have heard about it

355
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:15,939
but it's basically how blue teams and

356
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:19,510
red teams work together and red and blue

357
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:20,530
make purple so purple gaming but concept

358
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:23,319
makes perfect sense

359
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:25,900
how do you actually put it in practice

360
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,460
there's no framework there's no really

361
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:31,689
system that allows you to do that and

362
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:34,630
for that on that angle like I took

363
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:36,910
inspiration from my experience judging a

364
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:39,340
CCDC competition that was a Midwest one

365
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:42,839
and they use the system and I'm pretty

366
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:45,250
sure all cities use it is where you

367
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:48,280
supply your challenges to the to the

368
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:51,250
teams were competing using that piece of

369
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:53,890
software you assign what score that each

370
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:55,990
what they call the injects what score

371
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:58,120
each challenge carries and what evidence

372
00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:01,210
the competing teams need to provide to

373
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:03,130
show that they prevented successfully

374
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:04,959
against that particular inject so this

375
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:08,199
is the the reporting portion of it like

376
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:10,839
they submit their flags and if they're

377
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:13,140
correct we get them scores so again a

378
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:16,750
similar concept we've built our own

379
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:19,810
framework application that has three

380
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:22,030
modules Red Team do team purple team the

381
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:24,369
Red Team module basically allows us to

382
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:25,689
supply all the details on what

383
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:27,099
activities you're conducting as part of

384
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:29,530
a scenario it actually allows us to

385
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:31,419
upload a script if we create a script

386
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:33,760
that executes an entire scenario across

387
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:36,100
the infrastructure we just run it once

388
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,690
and all of the details are recorded in

389
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,370
the database the blue team

390
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,510
simultaneously Isis we are sitting in

391
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,760
the same room you are working together

392
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:44,260
the blue team records all the alerts

393
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,590
they are seeing all the actions they've

394
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:51,100
taken and that goes into the logging

395
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:53,168
database and it does it's magic and what

396
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,820
it spits out is how well we performed

397
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:56,650
against that scenario so let's say I

398
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,110
have a have a scenario we run it five

399
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:02,440
times

400
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:04,270
blue team records their response for all

401
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,240
those five scenarios and across a period

402
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:09,040
of time we know how well we did like

403
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,620
this day appear is suspicious what

404
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,840
happened here we should have like stayed

405
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:16,469
constant if we already had all the

406
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,309
alerts and everything but there are

407
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:21,309
situations when sometimes ask

408
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:23,200
accidentally rules get deleted or alerts

409
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:25,720
get turned off so identifying those

410
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:29,530
things that definitely is an amazing

411
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:31,210
objective for a purple team exercise

412
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:34,510
where we just said together and we go

413
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:36,429
through known scenarios without any

414
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,600
secrecy anyway so that was the second

415
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:40,840
framework or that is the second

416
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:45,240
framework that we built and that's

417
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,240
that's all I have for today so questions

418
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:57,860
yeah we're working on making a public

419
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:59,419
version of it right now yeah so it

420
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:03,428
should once we're done with that we'll

421
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:03,429
hopefully publish it on our honor

422
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,460
yeah

423
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:30,270
true and that's the that's the challenge

424
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:33,178
of being an Enterprise red team certain

425
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:38,760
things I'll give you an example

426
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:40,590
fishing employees really never incident

427
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,480
in a good response for employees and

428
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:44,428
there's there's now a charge involved

429
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,470
and everything all those concepts come

430
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:49,020
into play which is not it's not

431
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:52,409
necessarily a big problem you can always

432
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:55,400
simulate fishing for any given target

433
00:19:52,409 --> 00:19:58,250
group and play through and go from there

434
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,539
but there but yeah we don't want any

435
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:04,200
just any team member saying yeah I'm

436
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:06,658
gonna go fish whoever and make them feel

437
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,850
victimized and so there's those things

438
00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:10,890
that come into play and as much as we

439
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:13,080
want to say that you're gonna be exactly

440
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:14,490
as a packer or whatever there are

441
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,340
certain things we need to adhere to

442
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:21,140
there are you know you can't go after

443
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:21,139
cell systems during the end of order

444
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:29,989
it's just it's just business sense I

445
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:32,540
guess but at least so far we haven't

446
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:37,810
seen that it has impacted the

447
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:40,250
effectiveness of anything that we do so

448
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:43,190
sometimes you have to say well it's yeah

449
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:46,070
we just can't have that as a rule and

450
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:47,810
that's a discussion to have but it's not

451
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:49,010
that they give us a list and say this is

452
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:51,490
what you're gonna adhere to it's a it's

453
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:51,490
a discussion

454
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:05,270
so one of the things we're hoping the

455
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:07,760
the purple teaming dashboard is one

456
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:10,400
thing that our exits are always going to

457
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,690
be interested in how they have their

458
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,730
assumptions about how well we have

459
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:15,560
protected but they need to see the

460
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:18,950
evidence right so that's that's

461
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:20,300
absolutely one aspect of it other ways

462
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:22,130
we are doing it right now we have

463
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:24,680
quarterly business reviews and stuff

464
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:25,480
like that where we update update the

465
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,650
execs

466
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:31,780
it depends on who the target was

467
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:34,570
sometimes we need to go to the VP of IT

468
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:38,060
to talk about something we have observed

469
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:40,100
so it just depends on the exercise what

470
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:46,520
the objective was who needs to know

471
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:48,209
about what happened things like that all

472
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:52,329
right thank you very much

473
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:52,329
[Applause]
