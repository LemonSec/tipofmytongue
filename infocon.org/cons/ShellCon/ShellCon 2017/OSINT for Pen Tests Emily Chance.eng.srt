freelance OSN consultant her work

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,660
consists largely of helping individuals

5
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,330
and small businesses evaluate their

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,698
security posture through OSN often as

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,109
part of a larger risk analysis process

8
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:23,699
in her free time she watches horror

9
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:24,960
movies or musicals with her dog and

10
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,000
attempts to find more ways to automate

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:36,270
her job please join me in welcoming

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:39,450

okay is this good all right cool

14
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,940
so like what you said my name is Emily

15
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:49,260
and I am talking about Oh sent for pen

16
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:51,539
tests you can find me on twitter at g

17
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,519
underscore Solaria if anyone recognizes

18
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,809
that cuz you're an Asimov fan come talk

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,850
to me we should be friends I am an ocean

20
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:01,980
consultant which is kind of weird it's a

21
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,820
little bit of a niche job that I created

22
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,020
for myself but basically what I do is

23
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:09,839
private clients which is business

24
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,850
services talk for rich people and small

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,070
domains and medium businesses that don't

26
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,710
necessarily have the resources to do

27
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:19,020
full-on pen tests but oftentimes they'll

28
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,589
want to evaluate the security posture of

29
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,880
their business or sometimes of their

30
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:25,430
individual executives because there's

31
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,990
been a threat something like that

32
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:30,030
companies will come to me and say if you

33
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,559
were gonna go after this person what

34
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,950
what could you find where would you

35
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,329
start

36
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,970
what would somebody be able to find

37
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:37,559
sometimes that can you figure out where

38
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,259
my kids go to school can you figure out

39
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,170
how I take where I go to work everyday

40
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:45,030
things like that so that is what I spend

41
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,320
a lot of my time on doing today we're

42
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,170
going to talk specifically about how you

43
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:53,250
could take a thin and apply it to a pen

44
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:55,380
test this is gonna mostly go over

45
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,200
workflow and it's not specifically going

46
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,729
to go in-depth on any tools while I was

47
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,890
writing all of this I realized that I

48
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:04,770
could do entire talks on some of the

49
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,270
tools on their own and so I'm not going

50
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,098
to try and pack that into this talk

51
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,810
mostly just we're going to cover the

52
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:13,200
workflow and a few tools and ways that

53
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,940
you can use them but that is by no means

54
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,280
the end of what you can do with many of

55
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,500
the tools that I'll talk about I'm gonna

56
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,090
put everything up on github later there

57
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,430
will be links to the tools that I

58
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,379
mentioned and also links to some to

59
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:28,790
troll excuse me tutorials that I have

60
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:31,649
found really helpful so what is OS n

61
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:33,390
stands for open source intelligence it's

62
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,340
anything that can be gained from public

63
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,569
information sources sometimes that's

64
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,720
going to include things like paper

65
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:42,569
records the microfiche machine at a

66
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,319
library all of that could be used during

67
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:45,179
inoue-san

68
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:47,099
investigation but for our purposes we're

69
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,180
focusing specifically on internet but

70
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:51,359
internet-based

71
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:53,610
OS n so how are you gonna use it during

72
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,079
a pen test well the recon stage

73
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,329
obviously is where you're going to be

74
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:59,370
doing the most of this you can use it to

75
00:02:57,329 --> 00:03:01,590
find the infrastructure the technologies

76
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,390
that they're using and also information

77
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,799
about the employees which is definitely

78
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:09,179
not something you should neglect because

79
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:11,489
we'll see why later the general workflow

80
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,220
now when I start with a target I'm

81
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:17,340
generally not give being given a company

82
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:20,069
I'm being given a list of people or a

83
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,829
few executives and a company I've got a

84
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:25,380
few different places to start but if you

85
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:26,910
were just doing a external pen test and

86
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,040
they give you the name of a company

87
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,900
you're gonna need to figure out what's

88
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,940
the best place to start some of that is

89
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,410
gonna be determined by the scope your

90
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,239
time restraints things like that but you

91
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,859
need to decide am I gonna start on the

92
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,150
infrastructure am i going to start with

93
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:40,680
the employees am I going to start

94
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:44,220
looking through the technologies and

95
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,299
applications that they're using so what

96
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,519
information are you going to be looking

97
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:49,200
for about that thing if it's the

98
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,299
infrastructure obviously domains

99
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,000
subdomains do they have cloud

100
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:55,950
infrastructure do they have servers that

101
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,290
they have on their location but have

102
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:00,089
some you know internet facing servers

103
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,099
there what are you looking for figure

104
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,720
out what you're looking for technologies

105
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:05,160
obviously it's gonna be the applications

106
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,720
that they have deployed if they have any

107
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,940
web-based applications that they're

108
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,220
using figuring out what those are as

109
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,519
well and then with the employees you're

110
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,019
gonna want to look through personal and

111
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,608
online social media that kind of thing

112
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,840
you're also looking for anything that

113
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:21,390
could give you an indication of their

114
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:23,099
schedule the org chart obviously is

115
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,760
useful because if you end up needing to

116
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:26,770
do some sort of fishing or

117
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,020
some more targeted fishing knowing who

118
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:31,000
reports to who things like that and

119
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,289
obviously the emails of individuals in

120
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,810
the company because that's probably

121
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:36,940
going to be the first vector you're

122
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:40,150
going to go to if you have to resort to

123
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:43,570
phishing them so I'm gonna harp on this

124
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:46,060
throughout this talk for OSN you need to

125
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:47,860
be repeating your steps often every new

126
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,570
piece of information that you get

127
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,390
you should run it back through all those

128
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:54,130
same tools all those same processes you

129
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:55,810
get a piece of information you're going

130
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:57,670
to try and say what information can I

131
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,800
get from this information every little

132
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:02,380
piece of information can give you more

133
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,970
information spidering off of that and so

134
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,219
you want to make sure that every time

135
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,920
you find something new you go back and

136
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,750
apply the same process of what pieces of

137
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:14,620
information could i potentially pull out

138
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:17,290
of this one so we're gonna start with

139
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,310
infrastructure this is probably gonna be

140
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,230
the place that you're gonna want to

141
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:22,660
start if you're doing an external pen

142
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:25,570
test just because that is what you need

143
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:27,760
to know you can't actually hack anything

144
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:30,550
if you don't know where it is or what it

145
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,860
is so just starting out with a list of

146
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,390
domains for that organization sometimes

147
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,490
they may not even give you that

148
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:38,979
sometimes you may just be told this is

149
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,480
the organization you're going after so

150
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:45,240
you have to figure out the domains on

151
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:48,490
your on your own you can use let's see

152
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:52,510
yeah you can use several different tools

153
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:54,850
this got put a little out of order here

154
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:57,030
oops so you can use several different

155
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:59,860
tools some of my favorite tools are

156
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:03,130
passive total obviously because it's a

157
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:05,890
pretty easy web-based tool that you can

158
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,750
go to it's gonna give you a list of all

159
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:11,800
of your subdomains it's gonna give you a

160
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:14,200
list of all the various the trackers

161
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,790
that are being used things like that so

162
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,520
if you've got like Google Analytics or

163
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:20,980
anything like that on there you're gonna

164
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,349
go don't want to go there and then tools

165
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:26,680
like recon ng has a cert transparency

166
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:29,470
tool that you can use that to turn up

167
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,270
even more subdomains recon ng is another

168
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:36,010
tool that I'll talk a little bit more

169
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:38,389
about so then this side should have been

170
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:40,069
before the previous one apologies

171
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:41,929
you're gonna want to run your list of

172
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:44,029
domains through tools like passive total

173
00:06:41,929 --> 00:06:46,638
and also multi go is another tool that I

174
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:49,339
use a lot it's really good at

175
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,389
visualizing and so it's gonna give you

176
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:54,529
that actual sort of spidering out data

177
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:55,729
visualized in front of you to where you

178
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:59,058
can see okay I got this piece of

179
00:06:55,729 --> 00:07:00,679
information I'm gonna run multigo calls

180
00:06:59,059 --> 00:07:04,039
them transforms I'm gonna run a

181
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:05,568
transform on it I know I can get you

182
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:07,969
know four other pieces of information

183
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:10,699
off of this based on the transforms that

184
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:13,519
are available to me so things like that

185
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:16,189
multi go I love because it allows you to

186
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:18,849
actually grab api's from some of the

187
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:21,499
other other companies and companies will

188
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:23,179
generate their own transforms for multi

189
00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:25,610
go and so even within the community

190
00:07:23,179 --> 00:07:27,409
edition of multi go you can use many as

191
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:30,799
passive totals functions because passive

192
00:07:27,409 --> 00:07:32,509
total has an API and they've created the

193
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:34,369
they call them seeds the servers that

194
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:36,199
these transforms are on they've created

195
00:07:34,369 --> 00:07:37,759
their own seed server so you can take

196
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:41,179
the transforms from them their server

197
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:43,069
run it using it the API key that you got

198
00:07:41,179 --> 00:07:45,289
for your account and you don't ever have

199
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:50,749
to cross over those two tools it's all

200
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:54,619
gonna come on all to go let's see so

201
00:07:50,749 --> 00:07:57,499
this is passive total we're looking at

202
00:07:54,619 --> 00:08:02,209
right now is just like a first couple of

203
00:07:57,499 --> 00:08:05,089
listings for Best Buy but what I mostly

204
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:06,709
want to point out here is at the top I

205
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:09,829
don't know if that's as visible as it

206
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:15,289
should be but if not it says basically

207
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:16,729
it's got resolutions Whois subdomains is

208
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:18,438
gonna be one of the first places that

209
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:20,209
you start looking there's also got the

210
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:21,559
trackers section the tracker section is

211
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:23,749
like I said gonna have your Google

212
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:27,379
Analytics things like that any type of

213
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:29,719
analytics that they're using this is

214
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:32,149
multi go as you can see it's much more

215
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:34,219
complicated when you first start with it

216
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:37,219
you're gonna be like what is this what

217
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:40,309
all do I do with this what you're gonna

218
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:44,420
end up doing with this is each of these

219
00:08:40,308 --> 00:08:47,269
little circles is a data point that you

220
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:50,240
can then take take and right click on it

221
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:51,680
and apply a transform the transforms

222
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,149
will pop up for the type

223
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,890
of transform that you're allowed to do

224
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:56,870
on that data point your going to get

225
00:08:54,890 --> 00:09:00,140
more information once again spidering

226
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:02,240
out of that and in most hugo you can use

227
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:05,029
multiple different entities so you can

228
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,920
have a domain you could also have an IP

229
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:09,170
address you can have as you can see

230
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,520
these are just some of them you can see

231
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:13,010
that scrollbar goes all the way down

232
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:15,470
here so there's a lot of things that you

233
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:17,450
can plug in there and just start right

234
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:20,240
clicking apply transform right click

235
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:25,190
apply transform and build that web out

236
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:27,890
as much as you can so I've mentioned a

237
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:30,230
few times the trackers Google Adsense

238
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:33,709
Google Analytics there are several other

239
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:36,470
analytics and tracking companies that

240
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:38,810
will gather that data for you figuring

241
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:40,850
out those trackers and then matching

242
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:43,399
them to other sites that are using that

243
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:45,080
same tracking ID is gonna be able to

244
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:47,570
help you figure out are there other

245
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,399
sites that I'm not seeing here but

246
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:51,800
they're using the same ID so clearly

247
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:54,080
they're either being managed by the same

248
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,930
third-party if they've got a third-party

249
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,150
that's handling their analytics or they

250
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:01,189
it's not it's not their domain but it's

251
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:02,720
a site that they own they have some sort

252
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:04,640
of interest in it so you should probably

253
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,950
include it in your information you can

254
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,810
see down here for Best Buy they have an

255
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:11,779
investor's bestbuy.com

256
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:14,599
and it has one analytics tracking and

257
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:16,100
then the one above it which is their

258
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,080
forums has a different analytics

259
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,779
tracking so you can sort of start to

260
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:23,330
pick out you know what things might be

261
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:25,279
grouped together based on oh these ones

262
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:29,300
have the same analytics code this one

263
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:31,400
has a different analytics code tools

264
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:33,829
like DNS map are another way that you

265
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:36,860
can go about and start routing

266
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:38,779
additional sub domains DNS map can be

267
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,700
provided with a word list so if you

268
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:42,770
provided a word list of say common

269
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:45,650
applications that you think they might

270
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:48,110
have subdomains for that's going to be

271
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:50,089
another way to just start really popping

272
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:51,890
out as much as you can and one of the

273
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:53,390
things you might notice here is that a

274
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:56,329
lot of these tools kind of do the same

275
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:59,689
thing okay so you're using multigo and

276
00:10:56,329 --> 00:11:02,239
passive total and you know DNS map just

277
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:04,400
to get subdomains well not all of your

278
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,990
tools are gonna return the same results

279
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,459
not all

280
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:08,170
your tools are gonna have everything in

281
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:10,839
them and so making sure you're using

282
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:12,790
multiple tools across the board is gonna

283
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:14,620
get you the most results because you're

284
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:16,209
gonna end up finding things in one tool

285
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,130
that weren't turned up in another tool

286
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:20,770
and as long as you're cross-referencing

287
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:22,390
them you're doing enough to say you know

288
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:24,370
okay I think I've got a pretty clear

289
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,980
view here I'm not relying on just one

290
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:29,800
source of information so once you've got

291
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,600
all of this you list it all out you

292
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,510
start looking at it and you say okay

293
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,010
let's look for the actual where is this

294
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:38,230
hosted let's start gathering IP

295
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:40,390
addresses lets you know get everything

296
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:42,040
we can all the information about what's

297
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:46,149
actually being hosted on these domains

298
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:47,529
you know if you can gather any type of

299
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:49,029
well that goes later into the

300
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:51,430
technologies but obviously you're going

301
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:55,470
to start looking at these all of this

302
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:58,560
infrastructure and dig deeper into it

303
00:11:55,470 --> 00:12:00,880
repeat every step every time like I said

304
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,149
run its run something through pass a

305
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,790
total or through the API using multigo

306
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:08,410
use the other options within multigo

307
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:10,000
because you'll have multiple transforms

308
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:13,600
from different companies that may

309
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,370
different things or the same thing run

310
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,170
both of those transforms even if they're

311
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,880
the same thing because one company's

312
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:21,279
data set may be different than another

313
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,560
you might find out that you missed

314
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,920
something from one company that you get

315
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:29,229
from another so let's look at the

316
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,329
technologies now once again you're gonna

317
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:33,520
ask the same questions what are you

318
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:36,370
looking for and where is the best place

319
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:38,439
to start so you're looking obviously for

320
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:41,290
applications and services that they may

321
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,510
be using that may be hosted internally

322
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:45,399
or web applications that they may be

323
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:49,390
using as well that you can you know

324
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:50,890
start to look at this a little bit where

325
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,120
you look it's gonna be determined by the

326
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:55,029
scope of the pentest

327
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,589
obviously we've all seen situations

328
00:12:55,029 --> 00:12:59,230
where people say no don't touch that

329
00:12:56,589 --> 00:13:01,990
this is too important don't look at it

330
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:05,980
don't do anything to it if that goes

331
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:07,690
down everything ends a good question

332
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,210
there is why

333
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:12,880
if if that goes down and everything ends

334
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:15,460
why but obviously we don't get to

335
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,810
determine that so scope of your pen test

336
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,310
what you're allowed to touch is going to

337
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:22,479
determine sort of where you start to

338
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:24,430
look here showed in we all know shown in

339
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,960
if you don't know showed in spend some

340
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:28,540
time digging through it because it's

341
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:31,300
great there are other tools that do the

342
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:32,949
same thing you should use them as well

343
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,439
but I'm not going to list all of them

344
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:37,510
here because there's just a lot show

345
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,900
dance probably one of the best if you

346
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:42,819
haven't dug into show down much digging

347
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:45,010
into that to start is good if you're

348
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:47,590
familiar with show down check out the

349
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:48,939
ability to script some of the the actual

350
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:51,730
things that you're looking for because

351
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:53,680
they do have the ability just you can

352
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,810
script out some of what you're doing and

353
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,120
looking for with showed in showed in

354
00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:00,760
will pull banners showed in will also

355
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:04,210
have things like screenshots of RDP

356
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:07,270
logins and that way you then have a log

357
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:09,730
in a username that you have been able to

358
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:13,470
grab without actually ever having to hit

359
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:13,470
the IP yourself or look at it yourself

360
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,890
obviously other open-source tools here

361
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,110
that you're gonna use are things like

362
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:22,420
nmap I'm not gonna go over and map

363
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:24,550
because I assume most people in here

364
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,020
have used it fairly frequently there's a

365
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:28,209
lot to it

366
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:31,030
but if you haven't used n map definitely

367
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:34,720
dig into that and then multi go and

368
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:36,189
recon ng are going to have stuff for the

369
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,840
technology side of things as well

370
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:40,360
they're going to have transforms and

371
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,860
they're going to have with recon and G

372
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,670
they're modules that are going to allow

373
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:48,490
you to start digging into that as well

374
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:51,219
look for a company github look for

375
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:54,780
employee it hubs you're going to find

376
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:57,700
things like configuration files I see

377
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:59,110
Jason back there smiling we were just

378
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,480
having this conversation the other day

379
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:04,530
about looking through commit messages

380
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:08,500
and you can type in secret key the

381
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:11,920
number of pages that pop up with results

382
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:15,420
for secret key has to have an ellipses

383
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:18,360
to get to the end number that's too many

384
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:20,160
so those are out there finding things

385
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,110
like that can help give you some clues

386
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,560
about you know different things that

387
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:27,120
they might use I like what you mentioned

388
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:30,180
really like to try and automate as much

389
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,610
of this as I can so I have been also

390
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,770
teaching myself Python for the purpose

391
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:37,200
of automating a lot of this the Google

392
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:40,350
custom search engine API is really

393
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:42,720
really great and little pro tip with

394
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:44,070
that it costs money but you get $300

395
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,940
every time you sign up for Google

396
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:51,300
billing and the requests are I think $5

397
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:53,490
for 10,000 so just a new email every

398
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:56,160
time you need to do it again and you'll

399
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:58,380
never have to pay for API pulls from the

400
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,120
Google Custom Search API you can script

401
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:03,420
that out to start looking through things

402
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,710
like paste bin or sites like that one of

403
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,870
the programs are one of the scripts that

404
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:10,440
I wrote just takes a list of domains and

405
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:13,080
a list of keywords runs them all returns

406
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,180
me results prioritized based on a

407
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,920
prioritization that I've sort of set for

408
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:19,140
myself and it's nice because I don't

409
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:21,479
have to go to the actual Google custom

410
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:23,760
search engine you know web-based thing

411
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,470
every time and say I want to look at

412
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,910
this keyword now I want to look at this

413
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:28,560
keyword now I want to look at this

414
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:30,000
keyword so scripting out things like

415
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,709
that finding little ways that you can

416
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,930
make your job easier and have that

417
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:36,390
information just all be thrown at you

418
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:38,640
and then also continually monitoring

419
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:40,410
that because you never know somebody

420
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,780
might throw something on github and then

421
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:44,730
realize 24 hours later I should delete

422
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:46,170
that but if you've been doing your job

423
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,790
and you've been monitoring you're gonna

424
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:52,199
pick that up anyway even if it gets

425
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:54,780
deleted again every time you get a new

426
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:57,150
piece of information try to run your

427
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:59,220
process on it again and see if you can

428
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:04,199
turn it into even more try to continue

429
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:06,630
that spider web out so employees this is

430
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:09,870
gonna be the bulk of this people sort of

431
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:13,290
say well why target employees people are

432
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:15,869
incompetent individual persons can be

433
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:18,780
very good at their job but when you put

434
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:21,270
a lot of them together they're not going

435
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:23,670
to continue doing that job well across

436
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:25,408
the entire organization it's just never

437
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:29,009
going to happen

438
00:17:25,409 --> 00:17:30,690
they may leak information if you need to

439
00:17:29,009 --> 00:17:33,570
resort to social engineering later

440
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:35,039
having done this step to begin with is

441
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,259
going to prevent you from having to

442
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,730
pause your pen test to go back and say

443
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:40,889
well let's look through the employees

444
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:43,080
here let's try and find some information

445
00:17:40,889 --> 00:17:44,699
we can use to fish or social engineer

446
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,980
them or anything like that no you've

447
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,840
already got that and as you've been

448
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,220
going through your people through your

449
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,279
people searches and through your

450
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:55,590
personal social media we've all heard

451
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:57,419
stories about oh yeah so-and-so took a

452
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:59,749
picture of their desk and they happen to

453
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:02,999
have the login for Salesforce on a

454
00:17:59,749 --> 00:18:04,739
sticky note on their monitor well now

455
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:06,359
that's on Facebook and because you were

456
00:18:04,739 --> 00:18:09,299
looking through their Facebook you have

457
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:12,590
just now gotten a log into one of their

458
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:15,359
applications also it will make you laugh

459
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:20,399
because people being incompetent is

460
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:24,090
funny sometimes it just is an example of

461
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:25,918
this that I wanted to use more of was

462
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:29,279
when I originally started doing this I

463
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:31,980
was going to try and do some Oh absent

464
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:35,789
on our own ka-ho one of our dc5 six two

465
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:37,470
members and he's got really good OPSEC

466
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:39,749
like it kind of scares me a little bit I

467
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:41,970
almost think that Kehoe has like some

468
00:18:39,749 --> 00:18:44,220
second life that he's hiding from all of

469
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:48,749
us because his OPSEC is really good I

470
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:49,830
was shocked and probably that's why he

471
00:18:48,749 --> 00:18:52,049
let me do it in the first place because

472
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:58,080
he knew I wouldn't find much but I did

473
00:18:52,049 --> 00:19:00,090
find this which when I said when I asked

474
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:03,230
him what was up with that he said hey

475
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:03,230
that banner is cool

476
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:09,690
cool so if you feel like having a

477
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:12,960
conversation with ka-ho about his

478
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:20,130
graphic design skills he clearly has a

479
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:24,420
second career so once again the laughs

480
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:26,490
you will find laughs so employees who

481
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,690
are your target employees obviously

482
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:30,270
you're gonna look for people who have

483
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:32,070
their hands on i.t if they have InfoSec

484
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,929
you're gonna look for who's in the

485
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:36,149
InfoSec department but you also want to

486
00:19:33,929 --> 00:19:39,090
look for non-technical employees like HR

487
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:40,350
sales administrative assistants things

488
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,330
like that because those are the people

489
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,719
who are probably not going to have the

490
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:45,570
greatest

491
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,210
OPSEC Kehoe is this this admin he has

492
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:50,460
great OPSEC the person who works at

493
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:53,040
Kehoe's work and just sits at the front

494
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,330
desk all day may not so that might be

495
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,399
the person that i want to get

496
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:59,040
information from as opposed to somebody

497
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,410
who's saying oh I know what's out there

498
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:04,530
I know what somebody could do I'm gonna

499
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:07,020
hide all of this the girl who just

500
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:10,710
answers the phone might not know that

501
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:12,360
she needs to do that so what information

502
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,340
do you have about these employees if

503
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,780
you're just being given an organization

504
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,449
name there's a very good chance that you

505
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:21,300
don't have any information including who

506
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:22,980
these employees are which is the best

507
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,870
place to start if you don't have those

508
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,809
if you do have a list of names just

509
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:30,989
start searching those names but you will

510
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:33,920
find that most of the time you're not

511
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:38,550
going to have a list of those names so

512
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:40,890
start with the list of employees do they

513
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:42,510
have general staff pages have any of

514
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:45,750
their employees done things like give

515
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:48,120
talks or do interviews anything of that

516
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:50,220
nature anything to just get a foothold

517
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,139
into who are the employees of this

518
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:54,240
organization do they highlight employees

519
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,320
on social media at all do they have an

520
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,350
employee of the month

521
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:00,540
anything of that nature from there you

522
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:03,540
can start actually digging into some

523
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:05,970
more specific things LinkedIn is

524
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:08,550
obviously a huge place to go to get

525
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:10,710
employee information but there's also

526
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:13,500
tools like linked int that will allow

527
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:16,750
you to extend beyond that what you're

528
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:19,000
getting LinkedIn will actually pull em

529
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:22,570
dresses and gets you email addresses for

530
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,220
some of the individuals and this is a

531
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:26,260
great way to just start building up that

532
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:28,180
list of employee name email address

533
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:30,670
employee name email address because

534
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:32,470
that's really what you want to have as a

535
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:36,010
starting point for your employee

536
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:38,560
searches I also look through Facebook

537
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:41,560
Facebook does allow people to put their

538
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,300
employers on Facebook people sometimes

539
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,470
skip this because they think oh look

540
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,240
LinkedIn will do it all

541
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:49,450
LinkedIn has ways of hiding some of

542
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,480
these things Facebook does not so with

543
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:54,370
LinkedIn it's gonna be you know the

544
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,050
potentially you'll have a list of people

545
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:58,209
that work for that company and half of

546
00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:00,820
them will be a profile picture and

547
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:02,530
LinkedIn user whereas with Facebook

548
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,909
you're gonna be able to start pulling up

549
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:06,070
things like who works for this company

550
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:07,840
really easy using some of the search

551
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:12,310
urls that they don't necessarily tell

552
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:15,189
you are there but they are so going over

553
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:17,409
LinkedIn if you run into a situation

554
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:20,640
where you are trying to pull information

555
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:23,800
from LinkedIn and you're running into

556
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,410
employee profile photo and then just

557
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:30,550
LinkedIn member there's a few manual

558
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:33,370
workarounds for that obviously doing a

559
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:35,680
an exact Google search using just you

560
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:38,409
know the random google operators that

561
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:41,500
they give you cite : LinkedIn comm and

562
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:45,250
then taking that users title because the

563
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:47,200
title will be listed there you're gonna

564
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:49,120
pull up a page and if it's the same

565
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,190
profile picture well there you go you've

566
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,629
just matched them unmasked all that

567
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:55,510
information and you've got the employees

568
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:57,400
name the same thing you can do with

569
00:22:55,510 --> 00:23:00,550
looking through the people also viewed

570
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,960
section just dig through there a little

571
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:04,270
bit you're gonna find that some of the

572
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,010
people on that list are contacted or

573
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:07,750
connected rather with the person that

574
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,550
you're looking for so the more you dig

575
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:11,170
through the more you're gonna start

576
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:13,240
having a champ that's the profile

577
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:15,010
picture I'm looking for okay that's

578
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:18,190
their profile now you've got the

579
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:19,660
information and then also obviously

580
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,640
reverse image searching the profile

581
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:26,710
picture is another way that you can just

582
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:28,450
quick look for somebody there and then

583
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:30,220
obviously like I said LinkedIn you've

584
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,460
got email addresses that you can pull

585
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:34,810
from

586
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:36,580
that as well so start with once you've

587
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:40,060
got a list of names start looking over

588
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:42,370
your your real name searches this can

589
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:47,379
lead you to other employees this can

590
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:50,229
lead you to even better targets as with

591
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:52,900
the the people info in fro Tech in

592
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:54,490
decision ranked by who's most valuable

593
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,170
but also make sure that as you're

594
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:59,080
looking through who's most valuable

595
00:23:56,170 --> 00:24:00,850
you're not just assuming well the people

596
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,889
in the IT department are gonna be our

597
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:05,169
most valuable people they may not be it

598
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:08,680
may be the HR manager who post pictures

599
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:10,270
on Facebook all day so some things you

600
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,760
want to determine you want to get

601
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:14,440
obviously a work email address you want

602
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,420
to get any types of social media

603
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,940
accounts you want to get personal email

604
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:21,100
addresses as well and any account

605
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:24,040
usernames that they may use across

606
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:26,770
various accounts most people use the

607
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:29,110
same username across multiple accounts I

608
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:32,620
think most of us even probably do that

609
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:34,689
in some cases but if you get those

610
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:37,449
usernames you're gonna have an easier

611
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:42,370
time finding further accounts that they

612
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:44,230
may have in other places so just

613
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:47,050
starting out the searches there's a

614
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:50,560
number of tools for free and paid people

615
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:52,990
searches that's them and people are -

616
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:55,540
that I rely on a lot but I don't use

617
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:57,940
those exclusively I have a whole list of

618
00:24:55,540 --> 00:25:01,240
sites that I just open all of them and

619
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:02,770
pop it all in - every single one working

620
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:06,310
on automating that but I haven't gotten

621
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:09,040
there just yet the goal here is that

622
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:11,110
each of these databases is gonna pull up

623
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:13,540
different information and it's gonna

624
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:16,570
pull up different information given

625
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:19,629
different pieces of information on the

626
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:22,000
same person example of this is that I

627
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:26,950
was looking at people to find an

628
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:30,070
individual found a full name was able to

629
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:32,080
get a phone number from Spokeo which is

630
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:34,300
a paid service that is worth it for me

631
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,000
to pay for if you're doing OSN for pen

632
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:38,980
tests as a part of a company get them to

633
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,510
pony up for something like this because

634
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:43,370
in general Spokeo and pay

635
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:45,290
like that are gonna have a little bit

636
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:48,679
more information that you can then feed

637
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:50,960
back into the free searches so I find a

638
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:53,300
phone number on Spokeo I feed it back

639
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,670
into people and it pulls up the same

640
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:58,490
users profile or the same person's

641
00:25:55,670 --> 00:26:00,590
profile on people but now it has way

642
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:02,210
more info and it didn't have the phone

643
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:03,500
number there originally so something

644
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:05,660
about the phone number ended up

645
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,580
correlating more information on that

646
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:09,770
person than when I just used their name

647
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:12,169
and that's why I'm saying every piece of

648
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:14,480
information you get feed it back into

649
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:16,130
the whatever tool you have that will

650
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,020
allow you to search for that because you

651
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:19,820
may find more information in this case

652
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:21,770
it was a couple usernames that they were

653
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:23,899
using that I was then able to run

654
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:29,540
through a couple of checks that I used

655
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:31,880
to try and find extra accounts so

656
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:34,550
employee usernames are gonna be valuable

657
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:37,490
even if they're not for work-related

658
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:39,740
accounts sometimes you may find that

659
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:41,620
these are user names for that they're

660
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:43,970
using it across multiple different

661
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:45,709
platforms they may have Instagram they

662
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:48,050
may have Facebook they have all these

663
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:50,330
things those are places you can look for

664
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:52,700
have they been taking photos of their

665
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:55,460
desk with the the log in for something

666
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:58,400
on their monitor or even just knowing

667
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:59,330
well I'm looking at this environment and

668
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,010
they're using Macs

669
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:03,560
I can see a bunch of Mac's in this

670
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:05,060
office that in and of itself is going to

671
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:09,020
be just one tiny piece of information

672
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:10,760
that's useful you can find discussions

673
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:14,000
between employees that may give you

674
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:15,830
information about schedule about when

675
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,650
they start work when they leave who

676
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:20,389
their supervisors are information about

677
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:22,610
the structure of the organization that

678
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:24,140
will help you if you have to go on to

679
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:26,600
actually interfacing with those

680
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:28,610
employees directly either with a social

681
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:32,030
engineer or you know using some sort of

682
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:34,639
fishing technique employees sometimes

683
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:36,740
will ask work-related questions on

684
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,260
support forums this is something that I

685
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:41,360
have found multiple times where I have

686
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:43,820
found a personal username for somebody

687
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:46,429
and that person has used their personal

688
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:48,379
Stack Exchange account to ask a question

689
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:50,470
about something that they're fixing for

690
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:54,260
work and in those Stack Exchange

691
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:55,220
questions will be configuration files or

692
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:58,070
pieces of

693
00:27:55,220 --> 00:28:00,530
figuration files that will give me I P

694
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:03,889
addresses that will give me you know the

695
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:06,289
the login or even sometimes keys for

696
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:08,059
things less so keys on Stack Exchange

697
00:28:06,289 --> 00:28:10,730
people generally are a little bit better

698
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:12,049
about that but things like github those

699
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,850
are gonna be the types of usernames

700
00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:16,730
where you're gonna find per employees

701
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:18,469
using their personal accounts to do

702
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:21,740
something that they probably shouldn't

703
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:24,020
be doing putting work-related material

704
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:26,659
on their personal accounts but it

705
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:28,179
happens and making sure that you look at

706
00:28:26,659 --> 00:28:30,559
that is gonna be good

707
00:28:28,179 --> 00:28:32,450
continuously monitoring these for the

708
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,010
duration of your pen test is really

709
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:35,539
useful because like I said sometimes

710
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:37,309
people may be like I'm gonna throw this

711
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:39,919
up here really quick and then delete it

712
00:28:37,309 --> 00:28:42,080
if you are monitoring that regularly and

713
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,760
just saying all right I want to know as

714
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,460
soon as somebody posts with this

715
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:48,408
username on this website you're gonna

716
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,909
catch those you're gonna catch the

717
00:28:48,409 --> 00:28:51,470
things that they think oh I'm gonna

718
00:28:49,909 --> 00:28:54,020
delete it fast enough that no one will

719
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:55,549
know once again this is another thing

720
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:58,549
with you know the Google custom search

721
00:28:55,549 --> 00:29:00,260
engine that I've used to really make

722
00:28:58,549 --> 00:29:03,289
sure that I'm gathering as much

723
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:06,309
information because people decided hey I

724
00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:09,590
put this here and then take it down

725
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:12,440
github accounts obviously same thing

726
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:14,000
looking through the commits looking

727
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,710
through commit messages as we've

728
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,090
discussed searching commit messages

729
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:22,010
looking just in general using using a

730
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:25,639
search engine but trying to search

731
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:28,039
within the domains for github you know

732
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,870
any of those repository websites like

733
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:32,000
that it's gonna be really good for you

734
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:35,299
to find the things that you're looking

735
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:39,559
for they might not have realized they

736
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:41,780
left out there I use a tool called name

737
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:43,309
check there's a few others but name

738
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:46,158
check is probably one of the best ones

739
00:29:43,309 --> 00:29:48,110
for finding additional accounts so if

740
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,700
you're running up and you know you can't

741
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:51,740
turn up any additional accounts there

742
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:54,260
are tools like that but also just don't

743
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:57,559
neglect throwing than username in a

744
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:59,629
search engine and trying to see what you

745
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:02,000
can get as you gradually narrow down

746
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:04,669
sort of how much you're specifying

747
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,710
within that that that Google works so

748
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:08,630
start out with just the username then

749
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:11,630
user name in quotation marks then

750
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:14,240
continue adding on you know additional

751
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:16,279
operators and keywords or whatever to

752
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,799
try and narrow down to the user names

753
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:20,320
and the accounts that are relevant to

754
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:23,870
you

755
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:26,450
emails obviously if we're fishing

756
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:29,000
somebody we need their email so these

757
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:31,520
are going to be the most important thing

758
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,039
for you to get out of this however do

759
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,770
not neglect personal emails in all of

760
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:39,559
this I have been on incident response

761
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:41,299
incidents where the way that the purse

762
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:43,309
the way that the organization was

763
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:46,100
compromised was somebody checked their

764
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:48,379
personal email on a work computer and

765
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:51,408
they were fished through the personal

766
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:54,020
email so if somebody has you know their

767
00:30:51,409 --> 00:30:56,120
personal email account you might be able

768
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:59,029
to use that as a backup if for some

769
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:01,489
reason trying to fish their their actual

770
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:03,409
work account gets caught in a filter or

771
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:05,120
anything like that their personal email

772
00:31:03,409 --> 00:31:08,690
is most likely not running through that

773
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,610
and so once again people when you put

774
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:13,520
them in a large organization may be

775
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:15,229
incompetent and do things like let you

776
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:18,200
fish them through their personal email

777
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:21,440
accounts there are a lot of tools that

778
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:23,720
exist that will allow you to check email

779
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,950
accounts I like to make my own because

780
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,470
in general I don't like using

781
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:29,270
third-party tools and somebody actually

782
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:31,100
called me out for this the other day I

783
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:33,080
was saying a lot of third-party tools I

784
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,580
would look through the logs if I was

785
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,678
running that tool because that's the

786
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:38,510
kind of person I am and I assume that

787
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:40,130
most people probably would do the same

788
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:42,770
because if they're running tools like

789
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:46,039
this hey why not look for the logs there

790
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:47,510
are sites like Intel techniques comm is

791
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:51,080
one that somebody mentioned and said hey

792
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:53,120
that a client side I still don't like

793
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,860
relying on that because you never know

794
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,229
when one specific tool like that is

795
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:59,629
going to go away so having your own

796
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:01,760
ability to you know make your own checks

797
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:03,140
having multiple tools for that it's

798
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,908
going to make sure that you never find

799
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:08,000
yourself in a situation where one month

800
00:32:04,909 --> 00:32:09,830
the guy that runs this one tool decided

801
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:14,169
not to pay his hosting bill anymore and

802
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:16,908
your tools gone so social media

803
00:32:14,169 --> 00:32:19,820
employees may post photos of the work

804
00:32:16,909 --> 00:32:20,210
environment they may post photos or in

805
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,770
for me

806
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:24,020
patien complaining about various

807
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:26,180
technologies that they use oh my god I

808
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:29,720
hate Chronos it always stops working or

809
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:32,540
oh my god this is so horrible that's

810
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,340
gonna be an easy piece of information

811
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:36,020
for you because then you don't have to

812
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:38,090
figure out that they're using Chronos

813
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:42,350
someone has just told you that they're

814
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:43,970
using this specific technology also if

815
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:45,800
you end up having to do some sort of

816
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:48,860
social engineering having information

817
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:50,720
about that employee who their manager is

818
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:53,270
who at their company they may be

819
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,850
friendly with because you see these two

820
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:58,990
women go tag each other at lunch every

821
00:32:55,850 --> 00:33:02,149
third you know Thursday of the month

822
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:04,550
well now you pre have a potential for an

823
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:08,750
email that you can spoof from person a

824
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:10,760
to person B about lunch and that's gonna

825
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:12,500
look more legit and you haven't had to

826
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:15,220
stop your pen test or pause your pen

827
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:18,320
test to go try and find that information

828
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:20,270
in general people talk too much on

829
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,340
social media so just don't neglect it

830
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:26,480
because there will be things there that

831
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:28,580
are useful to you and most social media

832
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,350
sites also have a better search method

833
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:32,480
available than just the search toolbar

834
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:34,879
that will allow you to start refining

835
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,310
your searches down even more twitter has

836
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:43,040
one Facebook has one they all have

837
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:45,260
something Facebook's our URLs I'm gonna

838
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,730
go over the exact URLs for all of them

839
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:49,040
but basically what it is is you just

840
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:51,830
take the profile ID stick it in there

841
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:54,500
and start adding on at the end of the

842
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:56,560
URL what it is that you want so for

843
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,880
employees there is a way specifically

844
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:00,800
it's slightly different than if you're

845
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,810
looking for an individual person because

846
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:05,000
you structure the URL slightly different

847
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:06,200
to put in a company page ID but it will

848
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,280
show you all the people who list

849
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:12,790
themselves as employees of that company

850
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:15,590
these are the actual URLs for

851
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:18,320
individuals and you can do multiple

852
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:21,110
things you can do the individual

853
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,810
themselves so if you want to look at

854
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:26,360
just posts or anything made by the

855
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:28,429
individual you can do things made by

856
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:30,350
their friends and you can

857
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:32,120
cross-reference them which is really

858
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:33,469
good when we go back to like I said

859
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,270
you've got person a

860
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:37,098
be there friends on Facebook they work

861
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:39,168
at the same company let's look at the

862
00:34:37,099 --> 00:34:41,210
pages that they've liked in common let's

863
00:34:39,168 --> 00:34:43,190
look at the you know musicians that they

864
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:45,139
have in common the events that they've

865
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:46,340
been to in common all of these are

866
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:48,500
things that if you end up having to

867
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:50,450
research social engineering having that

868
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,399
information and knowing that you know

869
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:57,259
these two people like the same thing

870
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:59,480
it's gonna be useful for you so these

871
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:01,430
are the URLs and these are the available

872
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:04,310
search options so what you would do is

873
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:06,080
you would just append any of this to the

874
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:07,759
end of the URL and these slides like I

875
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,410
said I'll put these online so that you

876
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,180
guys can have all of these and see

877
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:13,098
people taking photos and what not but it

878
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:15,560
will be online so if you need it it will

879
00:35:13,099 --> 00:35:18,800
be available you can see things like

880
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:21,320
places visited pages liked photos liked

881
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,790
photos commented all of these are

882
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,940
various things that you could use to

883
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:29,529
start gathering information about the

884
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:29,530
people that work at your target

885
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:35,750
specifically I pulled up a few examples

886
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:39,220
of Mark Zuckerberg profile he is user ID

887
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:44,000
4 so you would just go back and fill in

888
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:45,950
profile ID 4 here and then add one of

889
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,290
these that you want to start looking at

890
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:50,598
let's say we want to look at the post

891
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:53,800
that Zuckerberg has recently made not

892
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:56,750
sure why you would want to but you could

893
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:58,700
he has made a few posts about oculus

894
00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:00,230
connect things like that you can also

895
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:03,399
pull up all the places that he's

896
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:06,740
recently checked in or recently visited

897
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:12,410
recently in Moscow spending all of his

898
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:13,549
rubles and that's one of the ways that

899
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:15,618
you're gonna be able to get stuff from

900
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:18,550
from Facebook like I said there's

901
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:21,830
multiple different URLs for different

902
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:23,089
like twitter has them digging in and

903
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:24,830
figuring that out I'm not gonna go

904
00:36:23,089 --> 00:36:26,900
through all of that just because I don't

905
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:28,819
have time in the scope of this talk but

906
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:31,310
digging through and figuring out the

907
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:32,810
best ways to search these sites is gonna

908
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:34,099
be really useful for you because you're

909
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:36,320
not just gonna be sitting there in front

910
00:36:34,099 --> 00:36:38,000
of the search bar at the mercy of what

911
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:41,089
they think you mean you'll be able to

912
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:44,420
refine it more - this is what I really

913
00:36:41,089 --> 00:36:45,490
want so let's talk about organizing our

914
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:47,619
OSN know that we

915
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:49,060
done it all this is a process that you

916
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:50,140
kind of need to do throughout the whole

917
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:52,540
thing

918
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:54,368
make sure you organize your findings you

919
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:58,000
don't want to be in a situation where

920
00:36:54,369 --> 00:37:00,130
you have this huge file with just a

921
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,869
bunch of crap in it and you miss

922
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:03,700
something during the pen test because

923
00:37:01,869 --> 00:37:05,770
you didn't look at all of the things

924
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:07,299
that you've got available to you all the

925
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:08,230
information that you've got available to

926
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,390
you

927
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:14,740
multigo has some built-in tools for this

928
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:18,879
for actually making case files that you

929
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:21,399
can then go back and look at but even

930
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,640
just having your own directory system

931
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:26,950
that you say I have a file here for the

932
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,839
entire case all of my screenshots for

933
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:30,669
technology go here all of my

934
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:33,160
infrastructure screenshots go here all

935
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:36,220
of my individual screenshots go here and

936
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:37,598
then look through all of those don't

937
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:40,240
just let it become a jumbled mess

938
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:42,460
because you'll miss something make sure

939
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:45,430
that you screenshot everything the first

940
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:47,650
time because things change I cannot tell

941
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:49,779
you how many times I have found

942
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:51,760
something called a client and said I

943
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:53,589
just found this and then they're like oh

944
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,720
well send it over to me

945
00:37:53,589 --> 00:37:57,730
and I go back and it's not there anymore

946
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:01,779
for some reason or another obviously

947
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:03,880
that's not quite a one-two-three process

948
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:05,890
it's not 30 minutes later it's not there

949
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,810
anymore but if something like that

950
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:10,509
happens and you start thinking oh I saw

951
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:12,220
something where they were talking about

952
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:14,380
this thing that I need to know more

953
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:16,359
about right now you go back and look for

954
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:18,640
it and it's not there well then you've

955
00:38:16,359 --> 00:38:22,690
just left out some information that

956
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:24,220
could have been used usable to you so

957
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:25,660
these are some of the tools that I've

958
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:29,020
talked about that you should definitely

959
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:32,020
know and take a look at recon ng is very

960
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:34,390
similar to Metasploit it uses modules it

961
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:36,609
allows you to add in API keys so you can

962
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:38,109
extend the functionality to grabbing

963
00:38:36,609 --> 00:38:40,270
things from third parties that you're

964
00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:42,310
going to want to use and also you can

965
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:43,990
write your own modules modules can be

966
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:46,810
written in Python so if you want to

967
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:49,209
start working on adding your own stuff

968
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:52,150
into there things that the tool doesn't

969
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:54,430
already do you can do that as well

970
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:57,430
same with multi go multigo is great

971
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:59,299
because the visualization of it once

972
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:01,910
again is going to give you a

973
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:04,070
a good opportunity to look over things

974
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:07,009
from a visual visual perspective for me

975
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:10,880
that really helps it uses transforms

976
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:13,130
that run on seeds the seeds are servers

977
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,990
that other individuals or companies are

978
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:18,230
maintaining and they're maintaining the

979
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:20,959
transforms on their the company that

980
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:23,690
makes multigo petrova also has obviously

981
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,850
their own seed servers as well and it

982
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:27,740
allows you to make use of once again

983
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:29,600
third party API keys so that you can

984
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:31,490
start using other tools right within

985
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:34,610
multigo you don't have to spread out as

986
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:38,750
much work and then da DNS map obviously

987
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:41,030
is another one that was mentioned so OS

988
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:43,730
int can be noisy people don't often

989
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:47,360
think about it that way because it's

990
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:50,330
just three con right well it can be so

991
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:53,150
test all of your things first test your

992
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:54,590
tools test your methods test the various

993
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:56,540
things that you're doing it's probably

994
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:59,360
not a bad idea to try and set up

995
00:39:56,540 --> 00:40:01,820
something to run your own OS int

996
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:04,460
processes against and see do I get

997
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:07,480
notifications if I am running this scan

998
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:09,860
do I get an email if I tried this

999
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:13,250
specific method for getting a password

1000
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:16,250
or forgetting a an email account an

1001
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:20,020
example of this is that there's a social

1002
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:22,640
media platform that had a password reset

1003
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:24,410
function where you could put in

1004
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:27,339
someone's email address and it would

1005
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:30,200
pull up their account and whatever

1006
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:32,210
Recovery Options they had on their

1007
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:34,129
account be that a phone number be that

1008
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:36,740
an email address now these options were

1009
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:39,080
redacted at one point in time they

1010
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:41,060
changed this and if you put the correct

1011
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:43,549
email address or the correct phone

1012
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:46,130
number in it would just fire off the

1013
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:48,920
password reset anyways well I didn't

1014
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:52,310
test and I fired off a password reset to

1015
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:54,350
a target so that's the point where

1016
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:57,799
you're just like shoot what do i do what

1017
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:59,600
do I do you test before so that you

1018
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:02,120
don't do that again and every couple

1019
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,890
months go through look at the the

1020
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,270
different services you're using look at

1021
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:07,220
the social media accounts that you're

1022
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:08,690
testing these things against or social

1023
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:11,660
media services that you're testing these

1024
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:12,109
things against and see have they change

1025
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,940
this

1026
00:41:12,109 --> 00:41:15,589
if I actually put this email address in

1027
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:16,849
here is it gonna fire off a password

1028
00:41:15,589 --> 00:41:18,558
reset instead of giving me the

1029
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:20,450
information that I thought I was going

1030
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:22,400
to get back from it and then also once

1031
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:24,259
again set up something to try and check

1032
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:27,469
whether any of the things that you are

1033
00:41:24,259 --> 00:41:30,410
doing are leaving logs that your target

1034
00:41:27,469 --> 00:41:32,719
could check for because who knows maybe

1035
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:34,430
they actually are not completely

1036
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:36,650
incompetent and are looking for these

1037
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:38,390
types of things that would surprise me

1038
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:41,119
but you never want to leave yourself

1039
00:41:38,390 --> 00:42:13,999
open to getting caught that early on in

1040
00:41:41,119 --> 00:42:15,499
the stage so any questions well so for

1041
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:17,118
me personally that's a very different

1042
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:19,249
question than it would be if you're

1043
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,619
doing it on a pen test if it's out of

1044
00:42:19,249 --> 00:42:23,390
scope I would say obviously immediately

1045
00:42:21,619 --> 00:42:28,430
right away if it's like oh I just found

1046
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:30,910
this critical problem with that is not

1047
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:32,899
for me to touch

1048
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:34,759
obviously right away go ahead with that

1049
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:36,920
and give it to them for me personally

1050
00:42:34,759 --> 00:42:39,039
because most of what I'm doing tends to

1051
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:41,479
be focused on individuals and and

1052
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:44,209
individuals mullmer abilities not

1053
00:42:41,479 --> 00:42:48,558
technical vulnerabilities but their own

1054
00:42:44,209 --> 00:42:50,089
sort of physical safety yes I report

1055
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:52,699
those immediately because when I find

1056
00:42:50,089 --> 00:42:54,769
things like that it's oh I just found a

1057
00:42:52,699 --> 00:42:57,410
paceman with all of your social security

1058
00:42:54,769 --> 00:42:59,839
numbers for you your children where your

1059
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:01,640
children go to school these are things

1060
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:04,880
that they're not going to want to wait

1061
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:06,558
for my report if it were for pen tests I

1062
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:13,719
would be a little more judicious about

1063
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:13,719
is this within so help me anyone else

1064
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:22,700
yes I don't have my personal business

1065
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:24,740
cutter my my business cards on me but

1066
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:28,490
it's called Urania group is our company

1067
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:31,879
or my company now so if anybody who

1068
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:34,419
wants to hire me feel free just urania

1069
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,420
group com

1070
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:38,270
you're really gonna make me spell it

1071
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:47,319
from the date

1072
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:52,190
oh it's Narwhal of course yes yes

1073
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:54,950
irregularly so I don't try to hide all

1074
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:58,340
that much just because it's not

1075
00:43:54,950 --> 00:44:00,740
necessary for me really I keep the

1076
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:03,200
things that I do need to hide very very

1077
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:05,509
segmented from everything else but yes I

1078
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:08,060
do look regularly just because you never

1079
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:11,180
know I might leak information at some

1080
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:12,890
point and I can also be incompetent so

1081
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:15,740
it's it's good to do that on yourself

1082
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:18,799
and family members I do because they're

1083
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:21,169
not as technically inclined and it's

1084
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:25,570
just you know I like to say hey did you

1085
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:28,930
know that I can find this on you online

1086
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:28,930
yep yes

1087
00:44:36,329 --> 00:44:44,680
all I'm there was one

1088
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:47,440
do I have time to share a small anecdote

1089
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:52,029
there was one situation and it was

1090
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:55,900
actually not quite typical for me but it

1091
00:44:52,029 --> 00:44:57,339
was a very wealthy woman who's concerned

1092
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:59,319
about her daughter because her daughter

1093
00:44:57,339 --> 00:45:00,880
had started dating a guy on the other

1094
00:44:59,319 --> 00:45:02,558
side of the state other side of the

1095
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,450
country rather was not returning phone

1096
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:08,160
calls had shut off all her social media

1097
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:10,180
several red flags for the type of

1098
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,009
isolation that you would see at the

1099
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:13,660
beginning of an abusive relationship so

1100
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:15,250
she started wondering what's going on

1101
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:18,578
can we find anything on the boyfriend

1102
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:20,859
can we whatever it took me five minutes

1103
00:45:18,579 --> 00:45:24,520
before I found his ex-girlfriend's

1104
00:45:20,859 --> 00:45:26,410
grandma's Facebook page where she asks

1105
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:30,400
that we please pray for her

1106
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:33,069
granddaughter who has HPV so now we know

1107
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:36,609
that during the period of time when the

1108
00:45:33,069 --> 00:45:39,339
ex was with this boy that you know my

1109
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:41,770
clients daughter is now dating his

1110
00:45:39,339 --> 00:45:44,529
girlfriend was diagnosed with HPV so

1111
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:46,329
that's obviously a sad story for the boy

1112
00:45:44,529 --> 00:45:48,520
a sad story for the girl everybody

1113
00:45:46,329 --> 00:45:51,640
involved I was like this is bad this is

1114
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:55,990
very unfortunate but I have a great

1115
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:58,029
rapport because you know your clients do

1116
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:59,740
sort of ask you to tailor we want

1117
00:45:58,029 --> 00:46:01,869
something that's gonna help her come

1118
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:03,459
talk to us or at least you know get us

1119
00:46:01,869 --> 00:46:05,710
in the front door to say he's lying to

1120
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:08,170
you about this that's the kind of thing

1121
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:11,349
that I can go back and say well he might

1122
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:14,920
be lying to her about this so yes the

1123
00:46:11,349 --> 00:46:17,130
the meaning clueless family members are

1124
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,130
great

1125
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:39,059
I find people's passwords posted on

1126
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:41,730
sticky notes a lot it is strange how

1127
00:46:39,059 --> 00:46:45,839
many people keep their passwords written

1128
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:48,119
on sticky notes on not because I've

1129
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:53,880
found photos of like the refrigerator

1130
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:57,839
and the refrigerator has like the the

1131
00:46:53,880 --> 00:47:01,319
password for the the router and the code

1132
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:03,480
to call the children's school and give

1133
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:06,119
permission for someone else to pick the

1134
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:07,910
kids up and you're just like could I do

1135
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:11,099
that right like it's that out of scope

1136
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:14,490
tonight can I hire someone to go pick

1137
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:15,740
the kids out like no I can't but I want

1138
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:18,839
to

1139
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:18,839
[Music]

1140
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:44,619
oh I yeah I I do that occasion I try not

1141
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:46,839
to use the skills for evil but I used to

1142
00:47:44,619 --> 00:47:48,609
play EVE Online and my Alliance leader

1143
00:47:46,839 --> 00:47:52,390
was an asshole and so I

1144
00:47:48,609 --> 00:47:55,210
doxxed him also using military history

1145
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:57,250
because he liked to be like oh I'm I'm a

1146
00:47:55,210 --> 00:48:01,930
military commander so therefore I know
