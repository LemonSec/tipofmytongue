people can hear me so pardon me if

15
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:53,390

00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:56,390
advancement I have an obnoxious window

17
00:00:53,390 --> 00:01:00,320
manager and Linux which I love but

18
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:02,809
causes complications hi my name is Jason

19
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,360
this talk isn't very isn't very long

20
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:07,009
we're in a short slot and so we're only

21
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,000
gonna be talking about one thing and

22
00:01:07,009 --> 00:01:12,200
that's public has three buckets please

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,880
enough enough

24
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:19,369
okay all right greets b2b made me do

25
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,780
this his was way too long and it was at

26
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:22,670
the end it's supposed to be at the

27
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,399
beginning my name is Jason I punch

28
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:26,539
things and I do computers thanks

29
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:27,920
Datagram for letting me to get on stage

30
00:01:26,539 --> 00:01:31,130
last year and make more of a fool out of

31
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,869
myself thanks to 5/6 to you for letting

32
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:34,399
me learn more hacking and thanks to

33
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:37,270
Seoul for goading me into giving a talk

34
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:42,170
out of this after I had had just one

35
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:44,360
bucket leak too many oh all right so

36
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:46,910
what are we talking about today firstly

37
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,619
what keeps happening with these s3

38
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:51,530
buckets that companies keep ending up in

39
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:53,090
the news maybe you know what s3 is maybe

40
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:55,910
you're super familiar maybe you have no

41
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:58,489
idea what s3 is and have no idea how

42
00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:00,649
there can be a server on a storage

43
00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:03,289
service there can't the articles are

44
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:04,580
terrible so we'll talk about that a

45
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:07,220
little bit we're talking about the past

46
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:10,128
history of s3 bucket leaks how long this

47
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:12,080
has been going on and why it's suddenly

48
00:02:10,128 --> 00:02:14,299
everywhere

49
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,120
we'll also kind of clarify the mechanism

50
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,470
of how a bucket becomes public because

51
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,819
there's a bit of confusion about that

52
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:24,890
some people think that buckets are

53
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:26,359
public by default and then with those

54
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,890
first two pieces of information we'll do

55
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,319
a little bit of soft balling about why

56
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,790
this keeps happening and then finally

57
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,768
we'll go into actually arming you with

58
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:37,819
hopefully some auditing tools so maybe

59
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:41,030
you can go to work tomorrow take an s3

60
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:44,690
key take an AWS key look at your

61
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:47,840
infrastructure and go god damn it bill

62
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:50,420
and and do it before you end up on the

63
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,520
cover of something

64
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:57,649
this next slide takes a little while to

65
00:02:52,520 --> 00:03:00,560
buffer that's I promise my only really

66
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:04,240
bad joke okay one of two really bad

67
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,410
jokes so let's start with some history

68
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,390
Amazon Web Services simple storage

69
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,950
service has been around for quite a

70
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:14,540
while it's one of their first services

71
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:16,070
alongside Elastic Compute I don't have

72
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,090
an exact starting date and frankly I

73
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:21,140
don't care it's been around a really

74
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:24,110
long time probably longer than you've

75
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:27,549
been using AWS and the last few months

76
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:29,570
of definitely seeing a climb in AWS

77
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:32,540
breakdowns in fact while I was writing

78
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:35,120
this talk it seemed like I couldn't go a

79
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:40,010
week a full week without there being

80
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:42,500
another AWS leak and because of that

81
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:44,179
increasing attention and because AWS is

82
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,440
getting used more and more these buckets

83
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,250
are becoming a more attractive target

84
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,290
both for independent security

85
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:50,690
researchers and for hackers both of

86
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:52,370
which should end up in you being in the

87
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:54,800
news because hopefully you're disclosing

88
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:57,980
to people when you get your bucket torn

89
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,340
up but maybe you don't even know so we

90
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:06,920
need to talk about both of those items

91
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:10,640
so in 2013 we started seeing kind of the

92
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,660
first first Inklings that this was going

93
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,940
to be a problem

94
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:19,279
HD more and we'll Vandiver nür Robin

95
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:21,200
would both have sorry

96
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:24,500
both have both do some of the first

97
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,940
large-scale brute-forcing of AWS buckets

98
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:29,420
now when I say brute forcing I don't

99
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,710
mean passwords because AWS s3 buckets

100
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,730
don't have passwords the conventional

101
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,130
sense but they were brute forcing were

102
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:36,620
the names they're trying to guess the

103
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:38,240
names of s3 buckets because if they find

104
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,830
a public one they can pull everything

105
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,170
down so literally they just started

106
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:43,400
going with big giant word lists and

107
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:45,230
reaching out to AWS and saying hey do

108
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,460
you have this bucket get this bucket do

109
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:48,140
you have this bucket oh you have that

110
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:51,109
one can I see everything in it yes oh

111
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:52,070
thank you and that was literally the

112
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:57,270
first approach in what they do they

113
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:59,130
found you know they found thousands

114
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:03,240
thousands of s3 buckets go to this URL

115
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:05,880
my slides are already published the link

116
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,280
is at the end of the talk but thousands

117
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,530
of buckets in 2013 already AWS wasn't

118
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,270
that popular yet but thousands back of

119
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:15,210
the nets from word lists guessing that's

120
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:17,880
not precision that's not we found all of

121
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:20,190
them AWS I think thank God doesn't

122
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,860
actually allow you to just look at all

123
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:24,900
of the buckets that are public because

124
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,630
that would be a disaster the numbers

125
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:29,940
probably much higher and people just use

126
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:36,780
obscure naming constructs that were not

127
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:39,240
familiar with so things kind of go quiet

128
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,890
if you look at news if you look at

129
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:46,500
history there's not a lot going on with

130
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:51,690
AWS and then you know in 2016 our

131
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:52,920
favorite nexus of problems stars starts

132
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,810
to hint that he's going to be in the

133
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:58,950
news a lot for all kinds of bad computer

134
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:02,400
stuff and also a couple of their

135
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:03,750
companies and Chris Vickery who is gonna

136
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,419
have a lot of connections and do a lot

137
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:09,690
of this stuff starts poking around and

138
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:12,150
finds a company that makes EMR equipment

139
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:14,010
with a massive database of medical data

140
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:19,409
in an unprotected a three bucket which

141
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:23,250
is super not good so we have our first

142
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:25,890
set of kind of big high profile s3 leaks

143
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:29,130
and it's not you know it's not a good

144
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:31,430
time and but what we do see some good

145
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:34,680
things like sentry publishes a

146
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:35,880
full-scale report on this they say okay

147
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,040
here are the mistakes that we made we

148
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,020
had really easily guessable bucket names

149
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,850
that was a mistake we're not going to do

150
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,770
that again we're gonna have highly

151
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:45,720
randomized suffixes on the end of our

152
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:48,380
bucket names we're gonna have gooood

153
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:51,750
buckets it's going to be really good and

154
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:53,430
also we're gonna manage our ACLs right

155
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:56,340
and this should have been like the very

156
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:58,230
obvious moment of here's the tone we had

157
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:00,539
really big leak here's a small tech

158
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:02,490
savvy company showing us all what the

159
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:06,440
right approach was and we all know that

160
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:09,040
since then we have had no problems with

161
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,230
s3

162
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,150
you know this this is really good for me

163
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:17,410
it's just like I can

164
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:20,710
so mostly Chris Vickery and chrome tech

165
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:22,630
going around if you if you look in these

166
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:24,219
news articles you know just ctrl-f

167
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:28,300
chrome tech oh good it's another chrome

168
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:30,550
tech one finding buckets through the

169
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,860
same mechanism of we're just going out

170
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:35,560
there and guessing names and looking for

171
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:43,570
buckets and no this one's open Oh what

172
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:45,310
is it oh it's a bunch of PII so I there

173
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,719
this was happening me so often that I

174
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:48,490
had to restructure the middle of this

175
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,010
slide deck because I used to name all of

176
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:56,560
them and it was just going to take too

177
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:58,530
much time but if you like there's I'm

178
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,190
sorry that's backwards if you like

179
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:05,469
there's a git repository and you can

180
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:08,260
submit pull requests to add your new

181
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:10,510
favorite s3 leak because we're just

182
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:12,219
keeping we have so many s3 leaks now

183
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:17,710
that we need source control to manage

184
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:19,390
them this is like this is getting this

185
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:22,000
is getting out of hand and the thing

186
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:27,430
that really bothers me is that it's

187
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:30,480
getting so bad that people don't

188
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:33,460
actually understand how they work and

189
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,560
like this this is starting to happen

190
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:37,450
where you start to see people think well

191
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:39,520
if this is happening everywhere then s3

192
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:42,700
buckets have to be public by default and

193
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:45,280
people are just forgetting unfortunately

194
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:47,140
not like like this would make me happy

195
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,260
if this was the case cuz then it's just

196
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:52,270
it's a matter of you know we just need

197
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,490
to fix that that's an easy technical fix

198
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:57,220
but no no this is a knob that you have

199
00:08:54,490 --> 00:09:02,110
to turn on and people are turning it on

200
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:04,450
and you know lots of them I mean we had

201
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:09,430
we had thousands a few years ago and and

202
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:10,960
now we're seeing how many s3 has same

203
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:13,660
default I don't know if this is big

204
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,760
enough to be readable from the back but

205
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:20,079
this is from the AWS blog in 2013 and it

206
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,370
basically says s3 is default deny and we

207
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,560
have multiple perm

208
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:26,410
mechanisms and we practice the least

209
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,150
permissions union of all of them these

210
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:30,100
permissions union from from like set

211
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:32,230
theory Union right we take all of our

212
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,820
permissions mechanisms and we join them

213
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:35,529
together and whichever one gives you the

214
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:39,310
least access that's the one we give you

215
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:41,170
like D this is not a bad ACL system that

216
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:49,089
they have it's it's actually kinda

217
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:50,949
alright so it seems like people are

218
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:53,440
doing something so let's look let's look

219
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:55,600
at the mechanisms for for how we

220
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,430
actually manage these s3 buckets there

221
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,529
are there are four ways essentially to

222
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,630
provide access to s3 you have a CLS you

223
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:03,070
have bucket policies you have ion

224
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:06,070
policies but these really don't matter

225
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:08,230
for making a bucket fully public you can

226
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:09,520
make a public bucket accessible to a

227
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:11,020
user you can make it accessible to

228
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,990
another vendor who might then make it

229
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:17,290
public for you because they're mean or

230
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:18,880
stupid but and then you can make a

231
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,800
bucket into a website which is a little

232
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,360
bit less risky cuz you can't just list a

233
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,040
website the same way you can list

234
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:30,459
something if you if you give it a bucket

235
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:31,719
policy or an ACL the we're really going

236
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:32,920
to focus on the a sales in the bucket

237
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:37,080
policies because those are the way the

238
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,079
ways that you can really expose a bucket

239
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,740
ACLs are the old permissions mechanism

240
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:43,839
there's essentially four permissions so

241
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,490
you have read and write on an object or

242
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,700
a bucket and you have read and write on

243
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:50,740
an object or bucket ACL that's it you

244
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:53,830
can apply those permissions to a user or

245
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:56,820
to an account or to everyone it's

246
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:59,290
there's there's not much going on there

247
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:01,600
if you try and apply to a bucket in the

248
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:08,189
console you get a warning don't do this

249
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:10,660
it's bad and if you try to apply it to

250
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:14,110
an object don't do this

251
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:15,850
it's bad and if you try and do it to a

252
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:19,750
whole bunch of things don't do this it's

253
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:21,160
bad like they tell you and you might say

254
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,779
oh this is just the console what if

255
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:26,040
you're using the CLI if you're using the

256
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:28,779
CA out say ah you have to do - - ACL

257
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:31,030
public read like you have to type it in

258
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:33,870
and hit enter make it public so people

259
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:35,880
are turning this knob

260
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:37,200
and and so this is the least privileged

261
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,060
union so you have another mechanism that

262
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,650
you can use right - which is the s3

263
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:44,670
bucket policies they're written in JSON

264
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:48,240
they're super powerful you can do really

265
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:50,969
great stuff like you can do this this is

266
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,640
an s3 bucket policy that allows any user

267
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:55,410
to access example bucket anything inside

268
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:59,610
of it as long as they have an IP in this

269
00:11:55,410 --> 00:12:01,620
slash 24 but not that one dude dot 188 I

270
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:03,840
don't know what this is used for except

271
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:06,870
for keeping Steve from reading like the

272
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:08,910
terrible things you write about him but

273
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:13,290
you can do this right it's a powerful

274
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:16,199
system you can go in here and you can

275
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:17,670
require 2fa to access a bucket that's

276
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,540
magic there's tons of cool stuff you can

277
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,969
do

278
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:22,319
it's a fine-grained system but this is

279
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:25,410
the one that I see everywhere though

280
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,050
this allows all of the lists and all of

281
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:29,430
the get objects to everyone in the

282
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,870
bucket I put this on a bucket and it's

283
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:33,150
important for later to remember that I

284
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:36,540
put this on on shell con bucket you'll

285
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:38,699
see why so I am a static website hosting

286
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:41,760
and I am not really as big of a concern

287
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:44,420
the first two ways bucket policies and

288
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:48,600
ACLs that's how buckets end up public

289
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:51,240
why is this happening because writing

290
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,350
these guys is hard it's long enough time

291
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,410
consuming you can see they're a mess I'm

292
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:59,220
going to show you a worse one later

293
00:12:54,410 --> 00:13:01,290
nobody cares and then they do care the

294
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,390
cloud is supposed to be easy right if

295
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:04,969
it's not easy your boss gets mad at you

296
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:07,560
because it's supposed to be easy

297
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:10,170
DevOps is supposed to makes things fast

298
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,939
and easy right and if it's not fast your

299
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:14,010
boss yells at you because why isn't it

300
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:19,560
done yet so you get it done he's not

301
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:21,569
gonna look at the AWS policies living in

302
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,880
the world without s3 buckets that are

303
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:26,070
public isn't free we need to actually

304
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:31,170
take time to do it and be allowed to do

305
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:32,580
so how do we find out when we fail this

306
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,660
is way easier for the blue team than the

307
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,340
red team for once because we don't have

308
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,600
to brute-force our own buckets now I

309
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,250
can't help you if someone else in your

310
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,600
organization is using their personal

311
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,940
credit card which you can't even check

312
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,440
statements on to put your resources on

313
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,530
s3 buckets that you have no

314
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,800
introspection into I'm sorry stress out

315
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:52,050
your employees less

316
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,430
but if you do there are some tools you

317
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,990
have Scout too and you have security

318
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:58,380
monkey Scout 2 is from NCC group

319
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:59,940
security monkey is from Netflix I use

320
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,709
Scout 2 a lot I use security monkey

321
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,690
slightly less no security monkey is

322
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:05,399
really heavy and hard to set up it is

323
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:08,070
way powerful and it also hits Google

324
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:09,510
cloud platform and github for auditing

325
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,889
so it cover a whole bunch of stuff where

326
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:13,769
you Scout to is great you can do pip

327
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:15,300
install Scout 2 and run it and it gives

328
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,680
you an audit report and you can have an

329
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,779
audit in ten minutes and you can find

330
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,779
that bucket policy this got to it's

331
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:23,910
great cs3 actions authorized to all

332
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:26,220
principals oh no this is terrible do

333
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:27,839
something about it oh look here are all

334
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:30,600
the things you need to fix it just tells

335
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,500
you it's magical by the way if you want

336
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,560
to see a really good bucket

337
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,839
I am policy look you can enumerate every

338
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,149
single option NCC group does this

339
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:41,820
because they care about security the the

340
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:43,620
security monkey people due to security

341
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,660
monkey does the same thing gives you all

342
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:48,199
of your audit findings just just install

343
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:50,939
them just play around they work well

344
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:53,969
security monkey also lets you accept the

345
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:55,260
risk you can provide a justification and

346
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,740
it will never put it on your reports

347
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,149
again

348
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:02,670
I love tools that let you accept the

349
00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:04,709
risk also it runs in docker and that

350
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:06,599
makes everything better doctor doctor

351
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:13,518
doctor I'm required by law to say that

352
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:16,800
once per talk chrome tech s3 inspector I

353
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:20,190
wish I could say this tool was good this

354
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,959
tool is not good this tool manages to

355
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:26,519
provide both false positives and false

356
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:30,060
negatives so both of these buckets are

357
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:33,269
public sorry sorry I take that back this

358
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:35,849
bucket is not is public this bucket is

359
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:38,550
not public that's what I meant this

360
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:42,449
bucket has a bucket policy that blocks

361
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:45,209
access despite having a public readable

362
00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:47,130
list and this one has a bucket policy

363
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:49,260
that allows access to everyone but no

364
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:51,300
ACL and you can see that when I run here

365
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:57,420
with - - no sign requests it just

366
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:59,459
happily lets me pull stuff down and it

367
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:01,709
also in their documentation they ask you

368
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,160
to give their system access to all of

369
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:03,930
the

370
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,069
three getting list functions even though

371
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:08,849
it doesn't need them they could have

372
00:16:05,069 --> 00:16:11,849
just stolen ncc groups list and it would

373
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:13,350
have worked better so until they get

374
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:16,949
this thing together I would just use

375
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:20,750
Scout to it's ten minutes and it'll hit

376
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:20,750
all of your other AWS stuff too

377
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:30,720
so that's it that's my brief talk don't

378
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:33,180
expose s3 buckets please go download

379
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,220
Scout to and audit your infrastructure

380
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:37,170
if you don't already have a robust AWS

381
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,910
infrastructure on it in place and also

382
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:41,250
for those credit cards that your company

383
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:43,439
does have the ability to check look at

384
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:47,069
your statements and see if this is

385
00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:48,660
billing codes on them and also try and

386
00:16:47,069 --> 00:16:51,000
not put impossible deadlines on people

387
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:54,379
so they put AWS bills on their personal

388
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,379
credit cards so that you can't see them

389
00:16:54,949 --> 00:17:04,949
that's it that's it for me all right

390
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,780
Jason thank you very much don't forget

391
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:08,669
