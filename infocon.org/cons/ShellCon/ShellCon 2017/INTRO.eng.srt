[Applause]

3
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:40,500
though this tech bullet over there it's

4
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,700
very important possible just open this

5
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,860
be excellent to each other but it's a

6
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,150
little more than that the community has

7
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,979
to come together and have to realize

8
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:49,380
that any kind of arrest important anyone

9
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:52,320
for any reason is not acceptable if you

10
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,360
see harassment come to us if this is

11
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,490
very important if you feel that these

12
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,110
reports you feel for a decent house

13
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,740
being harassed if something makes you

14
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,420
uncomfortable

15
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,640

17
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,660

49
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,940
registration desk if we only have a

50
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,099
limited amount if they run out I'm sorry

51
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:48,320
about purchase parking free time for

52
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,120
that bet but make sure you purchase part

53
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:54,139

00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,970
okay so the idea man hacking village

70
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,560
this year was I wanted to do something a

71
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:06,670
little bit different we've been doing

72
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,890
you know some of the standard villages

73
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:10,810
year after year and those are awesome

74
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:12,370
but let's let's branch and try some new

75
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:14,650
stuff so what are we doing this year

76
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:16,510

open for hacking disassembly pulling out

83
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:35,109

84
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,080

00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:31,540
little dramatic but let's go with it so

00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:51,459

139
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:56,979
job hunting we have wristbands job

140
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:58,899
hunting wristbands are read the job

141
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,660
looking wristbands are not read I forget

142
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:04,959
what color they are green I picked them

143
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:06,130
I should remember that so if you if you

144
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,119
put on a red wristband it means you're

145
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:10,320
looking for work if you have a green

146
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:15,640
wristband you too should connect right

147
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:17,620
slide I would like to mention also we

148
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,180
have two workshops running this

149
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,790
afternoon in the hacking village so the

150
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:24,579
first workshop is going to be a mobile

151
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:28,949
malware reversing workshop and the

152
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:31,120
second workshop is going to be breaking

153
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:35,200
crypto the easy way with feathered

154
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:38,470
feather dusters so we only have six

155
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,610
slots per workshop so it's very limited

156
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,050
space we're calling a micro workshops

157
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:42,370
just because we didn't have the room

158
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:45,189
this year to be able to do anything more

159
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:46,959
so the way this is gonna work is that if

160
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:48,760
you are interested in that it is going

161
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,400
to be a first-come first-served basis

162
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:54,250
over in the hacking village you're gonna

163
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:56,199
talk to April who is sitting at the

164
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:59,170
table that's in that corner of the room

165
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,399
and she will get you signed up for one

166
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:02,020
of those slots once we're out of room

167
