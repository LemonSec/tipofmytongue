welcome Richard your cell Khan 2018

16
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,970
thank you

17
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:39,360
morning everyone

18
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:41,820
with the mimosas so I think I suspect

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,219
some people will be floating in soon as

20
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,809
they are filling up which is what I

21
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:49,190
should have done before I agreed to do

22
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:51,629
this so thanks for choosing this

23
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:53,640
hopefully you'll get some information

24
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:57,239
that might be helpful in your career for

25
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,680
you I suspect it will be might not be

26
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,230
evident at first but I'm gonna just take

27
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,780
you through and give you an idea of what

28
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,339
life is like for me so we step come with

29
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:11,369
me as we step into the role of a CEO

30
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:14,450
just for a day a disclaimer this is my

31
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:16,830
talk has nothing to do with my employer

32
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:19,290
these are things that have happened to

33
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,439
me and these are some things that are

34
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,600
theoretical but as you'll see you'll

35
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,880
probably recognize some of these things

36
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,479
that I have to cope with as you have to

37
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,869
probably deal with them as well so day

38
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,240
starts emails how many of you sort

39
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:39,360
through hundreds of emails and crap to

40
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,250
find the hidden gem right and if you

41
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,860
don't check those emails and say this is

42
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,079
all crap then two days later though you

43
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,570
guys do didn't you get the email well

44
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,860
why don't you act on this so this helps

45
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:56,158
quite a bit so they starts with a

46
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:59,130
conference call when you're dealing with

47
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,899
third party companies business partners

48
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,289
you've got to make sure you're assessing

49
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:07,110
what they're doing and it's really

50
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,670
important that you've got your a set of

51
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,860
security standards and controls and

52
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:13,769
templates that you can then pass over to

53
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,130
them to complete it would be nice if

54
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,810
there was a

55
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:18,060
standard I know the banking community

56
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:21,540
and Finance has won a third-party

57
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,550
assessment and if they fill one out then

58
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,010
your company can tap into that and you

59
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,990
just accept it but that's not the role

60
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:32,280
or the way it is for the rest of the

61
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:34,260
world so I've had to fill out multiple

62
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,330
assessments some companies fill out

63
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,709
hundreds per year with their different

64
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,610
business of the company that they

65
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:44,070
partner with so it's important that that

66
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,570
you have this understanding we try to

67
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,890
follow some standards when we build some

68
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,030
stuff but we customize it because we

69
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,220
want to find out about certain things

70
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,320
where I work in public health we deal

71
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,080
with confidential patient information so

72
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,850
we're regulated by HIPAA but there's a

73
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,820
lot of other regulations I'll mention

74
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:03,299
that and as we move along time to go to

75
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:05,670
work being my daughter with me here's my

76
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,320
first risk assessment of the day there

77
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:10,410
will be more traffic on the freeway or

78
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,090
the streets how many of you who have

79
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:13,710
recognized that I know if this is just

80
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,590
me dreaming but it really seems to be

81
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:20,370
the case when it's overcast traffic is

82
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:21,210
less in the morning in LA okay so I

83
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,520
don't know if anyone has a good

84
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:25,950
explanation but I could just see the

85
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,690
typically Millennial waking up looking

86
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,310
out the window go and rolling back

87
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,270
over again because the sun's not out

88
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,700
anyway

89
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:35,280
so some of the things we have to

90
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:38,970
evaluate but again life's filled with

91
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,310
risk assessments 8:00 o'clock conference

92
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:44,190
call I've got to deal with the my

93
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:46,110
security operations team up the new cold

94
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:48,510
boot attack so we've got to take some

95
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:50,220
action so have them shut down or

96
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:53,609
hibernate to get rid of the sleep mode

97
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:55,170
that's not a good approach and despite

98
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,450
some of the resistance from upper

99
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:59,850
management we're gonna require a bit

100
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:02,130
Locker pin on boot so now they're gonna

101
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,650
have to enter two separate credentials

102
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:06,060
and we get a little hit from some

103
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,910
executives who want to do it the easy

104
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,920
way but if you've established yourself

105
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:14,010
and gotten credibility and you don't

106
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:16,469
come across as a cop right as a security

107
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,450
person that stops things then you'll get

108
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,700
people a little more sympathetic ears

109
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,229
and perhaps will listen to some of the

110
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,960
things that will cause them a little bit

111
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:26,610
I mean another pin what's that two or

112
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,620
three seconds extra

113
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,439
to get in well maybe they just never

114
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,180
shut their system off right all right I

115
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,770
arrived at the office I just want to

116
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,860
keep that one up there for a minute or

117
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:39,568
two it wouldn't it be nice okay although

118
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,009
we do have a couple of guys from edge

119
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:43,139
scan from Ireland so that's probably

120
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:48,020
home for them I don't know if it's their

121
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:50,460
office 8:35 okay phishing attack so

122
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:53,460
someone asked me once what's keeping me

123
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:56,520
up at night and I think phishing attacks

124
00:04:53,460 --> 00:05:01,109
are one of the worst because I can spend

125
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:04,378
millions in tools to protect our network

126
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:09,629
with layered security I can assess

127
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:13,169
regularly I can do audits but how can I

128
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:17,129
possibly train 5,000 people and expect

129
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:19,799
no one to click that link especially if

130
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:24,270
it's a joke from their friend supposedly

131
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:26,840
it only takes one right so this this is

132
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:29,128
this is something that's not going away

133
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,500
about five years ago when a phishing

134
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:35,190
started to first take on a lot more

135
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,930
importance I didn't I didn't think that

136
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:39,240
it would be as powerful a tool for the

137
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:41,819
hackers as it is today but it's so easy

138
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,529
and it's all automated and they just

139
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:46,169
throw it out there it's not going away

140
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:48,180
and the implications can be dramatic so

141
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:53,520
depending on your Incident Response your

142
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:55,919
detection it can wreak havoc so one of

143
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,378
the things the scenarios that we deal

144
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,909
with are all types of a phishing attacks

145
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:01,830
you've seen them all right and the first

146
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:03,389
slide one of the first slides I talked

147
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,099
about the spam email as you get right

148
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:07,229
you you're getting fished as you're

149
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:09,569
sitting here right now on your phone

150
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:12,240
you've gotten a few all right we know

151
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:14,129
that so what we instruct our users and

152
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,199
we have emails that we send out on a

153
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:18,300
regular basis informational we say if

154
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:21,300
you get something that looks suspicious

155
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:24,389
don't click on it and forward it to our

156
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,909
help desk as an attachment not just

157
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:28,020
forward and not just tell us about it

158
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:29,219
and in a screen print but we actually

159
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,169
need the attachment this we want to look

160
00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:34,289
at the header information and to see

161
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:36,539
where it's from what it is and then if

162
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:39,330
it's got a payload then we will check

163
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:39,909
out in something like virustotal

164
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,700
how many of you

165
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:44,770
aware of virustotal yeah so basically

166
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:47,140
it's an accumulation of all the

167
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:49,750
different data files from all the AV

168
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:51,430
vendors well not all most of them in one

169
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,860
location on the web and you can throw

170
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,680
your your payload up there and take

171
00:06:53,860 --> 00:07:00,700
they'll let you know if it's malicious

172
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:02,950
so that is a help but also don't trust

173
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,620
the users when you interview them by the

174
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:07,719
way interviewing is very important right

175
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:10,870
don't just respond with an email contact

176
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:13,750
them because an email it's so easy and

177
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:15,550
any and any of you who have experienced

178
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,380
this will know it's easy to say

179
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:19,000
something then later on you go oh I

180
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,159
didn't really mean that I just typed it

181
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,890
really quick if you talk to them the

182
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,990
they might be a little bit more truthful

183
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:28,390
to you well yeah I did click that link

184
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:30,250
button I didn't enter my credentials but

185
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:32,260
you click the download link right well

186
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,490
yeah but I didn't do my credit okay but

187
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:36,099
if you just send an email no I didn't do

188
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:39,130
anything and we've seen that so you also

189
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:41,590
have to check the logs right to see so

190
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:43,870
contact your your folks that got the

191
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:47,049
Gateway and ask to see the logs for this

192
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:48,790
person and quite often we'll have them

193
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,380
just reset their password all the times

194
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:53,860
you might have to rebuild their system

195
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:55,419
it depends so you've got to be a little

196
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:59,370
diligent but you have to have a process

197
00:07:55,419 --> 00:08:02,169
I might say this a few times today

198
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:03,820
procedures are crucial all right

199
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:05,530
everything's got to be in writing all

200
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:08,680
your operations have to be and writings

201
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:11,169
most people don't like doing this so you

202
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,340
can hire a technical writer or you can

203
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:15,460
just do it the hard way and do it

204
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:17,530
yourself but what I find is very helpful

205
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,180
and maybe some of you do this - I'm

206
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:21,250
driving to my car to work I mean I got a

207
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,930
nice guy live in LA right so but my

208
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:25,630
commute isn't too bad compared to many

209
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:27,610
of you probably except for those that

210
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,270
work from their home and I want you to

211
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,720
get out of here

212
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:33,039
and I want to see your face but I'll be

213
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,690
driving to work and when I stopped at a

214
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,640
red light I'll take my phone and dictate

215
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:38,770
stuff into my phone that I'm gonna be

216
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,510
saving later right I find the voice

217
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:43,120
recognition better on my cell phone that

218
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:45,280
on my PC my desktop I use the Microsoft

219
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,680
one that's a piece of crap but as I'm

220
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,990
driving at each red light I'll build up

221
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,339
you know a couple of paragraphs of info

222
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:53,970
of course I'll have to check it when I

223
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:56,430
get back but when you get great ideas

224
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:58,500
you don't write them down or speak them

225
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:00,000
right away you got something else some

226
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,220
other fire come in and you don't even

227
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,750
remember that I just remembering

228
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,860
something now Thursday I didn't do all

229
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,320
right so it's good to have that

230
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,820
instantaneous you know I think so it's a

231
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,530
recommendation think about it do it

232
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:15,050
safely don't do it while you're driving

233
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:17,220
just do it as you're you know waiting so

234
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:20,099
put in your procedures and make sure

235
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,480
that it's implemented how many of you

236
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,910
have had a situation where something

237
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,370
happened and then someone said oh let's

238
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:29,490
let's do something I go well Joe is not

239
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:33,660
here today he's off well doesn't anyone

240
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:35,820
else know how to do this well no well

241
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:38,010
what's let's see the procedure what we

242
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:41,790
he knows how to do it but it's not in

243
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:42,210
writing or someone says okay rebuild the

244
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,860
server

245
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:46,290
well Digory Joe's not here but all right

246
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:49,200
I'll do it oh yeah you forgot to update

247
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:50,849
sequel oh boy so now you got to unpack

248
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,880
sequel because you didn't follow the

249
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:55,860
procedures specifically so some of this

250
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:59,240
is obvious but it can't hurt to say it

251
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:03,510
again it's important nine o'clock okay I

252
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:07,200
am this is a bare identity and access

253
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:08,610
management is so complex some vendors

254
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,790
will come and say oh we got this great

255
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:13,860
solution for you but in reality most

256
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:15,660
companies have multiple apps on

257
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:19,830
different platforms written in different

258
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:22,560
tool with different platforms and you

259
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:24,110
know some companies say we have a

260
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,560
solution we have all these connectors

261
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:30,660
but the connectors for some of the apps

262
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,849
that are legacy apps will have to be

263
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:35,550
customized and that's a lot of scratch

264
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:38,880
to do that so basically what this is

265
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:41,219
about is being able to login on any

266
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,230
system and have a centralized login

267
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,720
authority and a record of who has access

268
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,790
to what I mean if a person leaves

269
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,160
wouldn't it be nice to be able to just

270
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:53,310
hit a button and all their access to

271
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,050
everything is gone so there's no open

272
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:56,579
access to this person you mean though

273
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:58,439
they had to scroll told employee are

274
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,700
they someone who has terrible security

275
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,740
etiquette at home and they're hacked

276
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,630
someone gets their credentials and logs

277
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,400
in and as them on your system because

278
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:07,600
you didn't shut them down happens all

279
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,220
the time so I am that's one

280
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,889
the biggest for me it's one of the

281
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:14,019
biggest pluses of an I am system plus to

282
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:17,230
make sure you have people approving

283
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:20,470
every single user that wants access to

284
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:21,970
any system right somebody comes in why

285
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:24,399
are they having access to everything

286
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:26,110
when their role is just this or they

287
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,480
move from here to here but they still

288
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:30,250
have the access to the HR database but

289
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,420
now that their job is totally different

290
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:37,899
so I am can help with this some of the

291
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:40,599
tools that I've looked at look promising

292
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:41,829
but they fail in reporting so a lot of

293
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,720
these reports that I was talking about

294
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:47,829
that are helpful that I want to run they

295
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:50,050
don't have so I won't name names but do

296
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:54,519
do your diligence don't just accept what

297
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:55,959
a vendor tells you because well I won't

298
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:58,269
say more on that that's obvious

299
00:11:55,959 --> 00:12:03,750
okay 9:30 meet with the head of

300
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:06,160
application development so make sure

301
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:08,290
whenever possible that security and app

302
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,810
dev at the table together from the very

303
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:11,949
beginning of every application one of

304
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:14,109
the things that we've done

305
00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:16,449
I employ mented about six seven years

306
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:17,800
ago I met with the head of a project

307
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:20,170
management office and the head of app

308
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:23,160
dev and built-in security into the

309
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:26,410
initial project proposal questionnaire

310
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,939
anyone in in the department that wanted

311
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:32,199
to come up with a new solution for a

312
00:12:27,939 --> 00:12:35,529
great new tool a great addressing one of

313
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:36,819
the missions of the department they've

314
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:38,380
got to fill out a questionnaire is this

315
00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:40,089
gonna be internet-facing is this gonna

316
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:42,069
be accessed by people is there gonna be

317
00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:43,360
confidential information on it just a

318
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:47,019
few of the questions that are related

319
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,970
more to security then and then on the

320
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:52,000
business side and business doesn't even

321
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:54,850
think about this stuff so in my meeting

322
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,620
with a head of app dev I want to make

323
00:12:54,850 --> 00:13:00,069
sure that they are thinking about

324
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:05,230
security in their SDLC to create a SS

325
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:08,529
DLC not easy because we're probably all

326
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:11,800
aware that developers when they take

327
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:14,170
their training in school there's not

328
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,449
enough security in there so they're

329
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:18,819
they're taught ok I got a business

330
00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:21,189
requirement I'm gonna write this code

331
00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:24,160
this is a great routine I just

332
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:25,510
développé I feel proud of this but it's

333
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,150
not secure but they don't think in those

334
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:30,370
terms it's just not taught and thus it's

335
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:31,840
not in the forefront of their mind there

336
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,190
are some that are very diligent and say

337
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,620
hey you know I want to find the best way

338
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:37,270
but but the vast majority that I've

339
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:40,120
interacted with and not just public

340
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:41,949
health but variety of places is let me

341
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,960
grab these libraries these are cool my

342
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:45,250
friend just told me about this three

343
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:49,020
quarters of the libraries that you will

344
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:51,130
find are insecure just a fact so it's

345
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:54,430
definitely something

346
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:57,100
a wasp will help with that right the

347
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:59,079
soppy will ensure that secure libraries

348
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:02,320
are being used there are other free

349
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:05,590
resources from a wasp I'm biased with us

350
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,150
but uh however it is the de facto

351
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:09,750
standard for a lot of the stuff for web

352
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:12,970
developers to help them ensure security

353
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:16,390
so if you're not familiar with us and

354
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:18,100
your you touch web the application

355
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:19,930
development at all either from the

356
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,840
perspective of a Davina developer or a

357
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:25,390
tester awesome in the security side or

358
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,190
even if as I mentioned earlier there are

359
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:29,110
third-party vendors that you deal with

360
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:30,910
the hash for your data you need to

361
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:32,620
understand a bit about application

362
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:34,380
security because how else you're going

363
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:39,100
to assess them and whether they're a

364
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:41,530
risk that you're willing to take ten

365
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:44,590
thirty now and I mean now a whole nother

366
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:48,610
side of your brain is going to be being

367
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:49,720
used the privacy we kind of take privacy

368
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,270
for granted but there's a lot of

369
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:55,330
discussions around this country and and

370
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:58,170
with the GDR P in Europe about privacy

371
00:14:55,330 --> 00:15:01,000
and its importance and how America

372
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:03,099
everyone owns your data except for you

373
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,030
and in Europe nobody owns it except for

374
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:08,680
you as big difference so our privacy

375
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:10,660
officer has a difficult job because

376
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,089
they're going against the culture in

377
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:16,000
America but we do but we work together

378
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:18,310
right HIPPA came out and the Privacy

379
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,940
Rule was a little bit for the Security

380
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:25,150
Rule this goes back to the four or three

381
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:27,460
years I believe and there's a lot of

382
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:29,860
collaboration some of the privacy rules

383
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:31,990
have some security requirements in them

384
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,490
there are other privacy rules that you

385
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:35,270
should be aware of where you work

386
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:38,390
there's probably some type

387
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:40,610
of privacy guidelines for you every

388
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:42,770
company has to have a privacy statement

389
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,270
you've seen them all you've gotten the

390
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:48,710
stuff in the mail if you want to opt out

391
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:50,900
I can't emphasize enough how important

392
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:52,100
this is quite often we don't realize

393
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:56,860
that we think in terms of security

394
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:59,450
security but if the data gets out there

395
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:02,900
that that's a that's a huge deal and the

396
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:05,750
cost the potential cost to a company can

397
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:07,220
be pretty high I know that for example

398
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,500
with the Office of Civil Rights which

399
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:11,540
manages HIPAA violations

400
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,220
the last five years they've really

401
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:16,760
started enforcing their million dollar

402
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:18,740
fines and more it's a risk that your

403
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,710
company has to assess and some companies

404
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:23,510
frankly if they're big enough and if

405
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:25,130
they're not regulated enough might just

406
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:26,870
say this is an acceptable risk I'm

407
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:30,710
moving forward when it will just get

408
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:32,270
fined and versus the cost of good

409
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:35,950
security I've seen it

410
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:35,949
some of you shaking your head yes

411
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:45,540
good question how many of you are

412
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:46,890
familiar with cyber insurance yeah it's

413
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,420
it's gaining if I ask that question

414
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:50,880
three or four years ago probably have

415
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,300
half the hands the party so here's the

416
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,360
deal

417
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:57,689
cyber insurance is starting to become a

418
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,940
requirement to protect the UH non going

419
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:01,740
concern any company that wants to

420
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,839
continue doing business if they're large

421
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:06,000
enough and they could absorb the costs

422
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,370
and some are as I just mentioned period

423
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:13,079
the risk assessment aspect but the

424
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:14,729
majority especially SMB better look at

425
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:16,859
some cyber insurance but here's the

426
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:18,510
problem with cyber insurance a couple of

427
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:20,879
problems and anyone raise their hand if

428
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:22,290
I miss something please do thank you for

429
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,600
raising a question at any time please

430
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,889
feel free to ask something that way I

431
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:31,919
don't have to go through the whole slide

432
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:35,130
deck so most cite most breaches most

433
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:38,070
cyber incidents the cyber insurance that

434
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:40,559
you get usually isn't enough to cover it

435
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:43,070
all so there's going to be some

436
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,660
out-of-pocket costs for every company

437
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:49,260
think about your own insurance health

438
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:51,480
life these guys are very clever they're

439
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:54,059
the same people offering cyber insurance

440
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,110
it's another money-making operation they

441
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:57,899
they know there's not a lot of

442
00:17:55,110 --> 00:18:00,149
competition for it yet and they're

443
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:02,910
experts at creating loopholes and

444
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:05,220
creating areas with is deductible all

445
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:07,650
kinds of thats one aspect so you will

446
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:13,020
not get enough coverage the other aspect

447
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:16,110
is they will assess you initially and if

448
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:18,420
you're not practicing good security then

449
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:20,550
either you your rate will go very high

450
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,720
or they won't cover if there's a breach

451
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,860
because they said hey you didn't do your

452
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,429
part you're not secure we're not

453
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:28,559
covering so things to think about when

454
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:30,360
you're looking at a at a cyber insurance

455
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:33,620
provider read the fine print that's

456
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,620
unfortunate the way it is yes

457
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:43,290
every organization is willing to cover

458
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:44,670
if we lose 100 K all we cover it but if

459
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:46,678
it's 5 million we don't

460
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:47,670
but then the other point is okay what's

461
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:50,220
the other limit

462
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:52,230
okay well above that we would be able to

463
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,030
business but it gets so expensive cover

464
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:56,490
that that's not a good investment

465
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:58,020
neither what I've seen work and used

466
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:00,540
more and more quantitative risk

467
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,410
assessment putting numbers to actual

468
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,570
relevant

469
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:05,100
let's get 10 because they tell you

470
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:06,720
everything they don't care but they

471
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,600
don't agree you have a board on the

472
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,490
initial costs on one side 25 risk

473
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,830
assessment on the other side what will

474
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:16,910
be willing to to cover in the case of it

475
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:23,010
even that helps you to find meaningful

476
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:25,440
insurance rather than just okay good

477
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:27,330
points one before I go the next slide I

478
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,630
want to just stress one really important

479
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:33,110
thing which seems to still be

480
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:37,830
misunderstood it's getting better

481
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:40,620
some people look at regulations and if

482
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:43,490
you meet your regulations that security

483
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:46,229
know compliance and security are two

484
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:48,120
totally totally different things

485
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:50,160
we know secured the people in this room

486
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,928
know security the business side knows

487
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,290
compliance right

488
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:56,549
the I've seen companies go to a seesaw

489
00:19:55,290 --> 00:20:00,000
throw them against the wall not

490
00:19:56,549 --> 00:20:02,700
literally and say we comply we passed

491
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,299
our last PCI audit and we're compliant

492
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:09,210
how the hell did we get breached because

493
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:13,309
compliance will not ensure your security

494
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:16,290
yes sir exactly

495
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:17,790
so don't make that mistake and don't let

496
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:19,590
your upper management convince you that

497
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:21,678
you don't have to make that spend

498
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:24,389
because you're already compliant

499
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,730
compliant as a checkbox and that will

500
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:29,010
allow you to conduct business you pace

501
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:32,630
PCI you need that to conduct your credit

502
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:32,629
card business yeah

503
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,400
it's one of the many things it's one of

504
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:45,010
the requirements don't stop there right

505
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,500
yes I've been properly corrected it's

506
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:49,419
important but that's not the total

507
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:52,500
security package that you need it's one

508
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:52,500
thing thank you

509
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:06,490
I find that when I talk I consult a lot

510
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,928
to other people in these positions like

511
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:09,730
like what you have and a lot of times

512
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:11,710
the struggles they talk about is how

513
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:13,630
they get their message across the other

514
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,640
people exactly that every making

515
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:17,530
decisions with that and how they can

516
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,659
convince them like no link if we don't

517
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:21,460
do this this is a problem like this this

518
00:21:19,659 --> 00:21:24,789
is a big risk area smallest area but

519
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:26,830
when you talk technicals yes I could

520
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:28,780
talk about it later but just real quick

521
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:31,178
let me just so I don't believe your hang

522
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:34,750
in there let me mention one of the

523
00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:37,539
things that I do is I health insurance

524
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:39,159
earlier I'll talk to the upper

525
00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:40,240
management about health insurance so

526
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:42,850
I've done this in the past

527
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,380

539
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:09,190
security we're here where we were where

540
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,539
we are right now why would you why would

541
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:12,549
you want me to do that how is that any

542
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:15,370
different it's you and your family is

543
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:16,990
this business important to you I mean

544
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:18,219
maybe not in those words depending on

545
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:20,380
who it is they might get really pissed

546
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:23,110
off don't tell me what to do it but you

547
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:24,970
know if you have that's the type of

548
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:27,370
message just try to relate it in their

549
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:28,960
terms all right and I'll talk later on

550
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:31,989
about you know how to speak to the

551
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,010
c-suite a little bit some of the

552
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:38,590
experiences I've had that's a good

553
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:40,169
question okay so security awareness you

554
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:44,020
know touched on it earlier with the

555
00:22:40,169 --> 00:22:46,870
phishing attacks that we get security

556
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:48,520
awareness cannot be overstated it's

557
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:50,949
really important it's a people issue

558
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,220
because we do have a people problem

559
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:56,640
but it's not their fault I mean come on

560
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:59,050
there where I am I've got I've got

561
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:02,470
clinicians I've got epidemiologists I've

562
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:04,690
got doctors nurses administrative people

563
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:07,810
and then their focus is on their

564
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:09,790
expertise their role right they don't

565
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:11,889
want to know about that files they don't

566
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:13,629
want to know about you know how many

567
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,900
attacks came through the firewall didn't

568
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:20,170
even want to know what a firewall does

569
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:22,600
but they have to know some basic rules

570
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:25,300
of how to use the systems that we

571
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:27,429
provide them basic just basic and that's

572
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:29,860
what the security awareness is all about

573
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:33,250
I mentioned earlier you know don't click

574
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:35,320
on the links don't open attachments you

575
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:38,410
know good luck getting 100% on that but

576
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:40,600
as marco pointed out there's many things

577
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:42,280
that you can do in security and just

578
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:45,250
because one thing isn't the answer all

579
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:47,590
you don't stop doing it you have to do

580
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:49,990
each of these things AV caches what 18

581
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:53,830
percent of the attacks but don't pull

582
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:56,220
your AV out you can upgrade it but

583
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:59,169
that's another story

584
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:00,760
so what we do is we'll have several

585
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:02,080
events per year where we'll get a bunch

586
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,120
of people in a room and I'll bring in

587
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,040
speakers from the FBI Secret Service

588
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,360
District Attorney I get the district

589
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,340
attorney regularly because I work in LA

590
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,580
County so that's that's a nice thing

591
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:14,830
I'll give talks on a variety of subjects

592
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,939
security is really wide and deep so

593
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:19,480
there's tons of things we could talk

594
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:21,550
about I try to make it personal so in

595
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:24,610
the advertisement that I send out in the

596
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:25,930
email also when I there's a there's a

597
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:27,909
journal that's published in the

598
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:30,070
department and there's also a countywide

599
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:31,900
thing so we'll try to publish articles

600
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:33,700
in there but will will tell people with

601
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:36,220
a something like protect your kids

602
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,510
online now not everyone has kids but

603
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:39,130
they have friends or their errands or

604
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:40,570
uncles or something so that's a

605
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:42,730
compelling thing because nobody wants a

606
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:44,649
young kid to get their ID stolen or get

607
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:47,230
cyber bullied you know how to shop

608
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:50,500
safely online how to how to secure your

609
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:53,260
smartphone so we make it personal and at

610
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:55,510
first when I started this 12 years ago

611
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:58,629
actually upper management said well this

612
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:59,740
isn't County why you training money to

613
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:02,110
expect people to come to these meetings

614
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:03,230
and miss work for private stuff I said

615
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:04,760
okay

616
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:06,800
well first of all wants to get him in

617
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:09,050
the room I lead off with a county policy

618
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:13,129
stuff but then I turn it over to the

619
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:16,100
speaker so but more importantly they're

620
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:18,560
not gonna come that much if it's just

621
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:21,560
hey unless it's mandatory and these

622
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:23,780
aren't so you have to want them to be

623
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:26,830
there and they want they're gonna need

624
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:28,970
to so want to be there as well and

625
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:31,699
they'll learn something that they can

626
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:33,500
take home and who knows right maybe the

627
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,510
next attack is coming through their home

628
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:38,120
system as they come in through our your

629
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:41,600
systems so if they're practicing a

630
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:45,320
sanitary security policy at home that

631
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:47,449
will indirectly potentially help us out

632
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,730
plus if they're thinking more about

633
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:52,490
security it's in their brain if they're

634
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:54,140
it's part of that subconscious it's a

635
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:56,960
stream of consciousness as they do their

636
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:58,250
job so if they see something you know

637
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,630
they see somebody look going and

638
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:01,760
clicking on a site they go hey hey what

639
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:05,690
are you doing I've seen that you know as

640
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:07,820
just you know it happens we're all you

641
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:09,380
know teammates basically where you work

642
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:11,540
hopefully there's a there's a feeling

643
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,500
that we're on the same team people will

644
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,909
help each other out

645
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:17,180
and so if it's in their mind they'll

646
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:19,370
come you know I published articles on on

647
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:20,990
identity theft and there's something

648
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:23,689
called medical identity theft which is

649
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:25,640
really tough because unlike ID theft

650
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:28,250
which Federal Trade Commission helps

651
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:31,130
manage and help people recover with

652
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:33,200
medical it can take years that the

653
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:35,510
mechanisms are just not there yet for

654
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,520
that still and I wrote an article just

655
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,870
six seven years ago on this so it's

656
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,570
difficult so you got to be careful

657
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:43,459
imagine going to get a procedure and

658
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:46,310
you're allergic to penicillin but the

659
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:48,740
person who got your ID and had a

660
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:50,389
procedure done and they said oh no I'm

661
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,620
not allergic to penicillin and now it's

662
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:53,510
your turn and they inject you with

663
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:55,550
penicillin I mean sounds far-fetched but

664
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:57,230
not it happens stuff like that happens

665
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:58,730
so someone says hey I'm here for the

666
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:01,190
surgeries now you had that surgery last

667
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:02,360
year no I didn't or you get bill for

668
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,770
your insurance company for something

669
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:09,310
that you didn't do but it was someone

670
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:12,080
using your ID 1215 I've got to meet with

671
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:14,540
with system admin and then the help desk

672
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,780
team to make sure that the change

673
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:19,510
management modules in place as

674
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:20,950
satellite security but it touches on it

675
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:23,560
because if you don't have a change

676
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:25,870
management process where you work people

677
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,520
make changes and all of a sudden

678
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:29,169
something happens so you've veered away

679
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,000
from your standard image you veered away

680
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:32,350
from your standard processes and you

681
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,900
potentially opened up a back door

682
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:39,520
because just somebody didn't know or

683
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:40,960
they had a misperception or their they

684
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,340
had another idea about doing something

685
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,650
else and maybe they implement there is

686
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,520
something really cool but forgotten

687
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:47,740
something else so we have to have a

688
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,110
formal process and everyone needs to

689
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:53,800
have that lunchtime

690
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:55,840
nice lah some bamboo doctor okay

691
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:59,680
next after lunch who meet with the app

692
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:03,040
dev team alright this is an important

693
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:06,810
concept some people that I've spoken to

694
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:11,950
they'll take the good step of getting a

695
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:14,950
static security scanner okay so that

696
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:18,760
scans uncompelled source code so what

697
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:22,360
we've done we bought a tool and we set

698
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:24,129
it up inside the development process so

699
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,340
when the developers check in code it

700
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:28,870
scans it and looks for potential

701
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:30,520
vulnerabilities based on you know its

702
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:32,469
understanding of what was written in

703
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:36,389
what is liable to be able to take

704
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:39,010
advantage of that code they then will

705
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:40,870
make the corrections to it because it

706
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:43,060
does give them links to sites on how to

707
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:44,949
address that because again they're not

708
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:48,220
trained appropriately because most

709
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:50,260
developers don't have the schooling that

710
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:52,390
includes security it's still a problem

711
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:55,060
today even though this has been an old

712
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:57,700
topic you have to spoken to people some

713
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:59,080
schools are improving and they're

714
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:02,170
they're baking it in a little bit but

715
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:05,530
it's it's very very difficult so we just

716
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:07,660
want to make sure that you know ideally

717
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:10,000
I mean it cost money but make sure

718
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:12,340
there's something going on that the

719
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:17,280
developers can do so to give you an

720
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:20,439
example when we first started doing our

721
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:22,180
dynamic scanning which is done after the

722
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,610
code is already compiled and it's done

723
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:26,770
by my team security we would scan apps

724
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:28,870
before they can go live we're finding

725
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:29,820
medium and high-risk phone abilities all

726
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:34,320
over the place

727
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:37,859
we put in this static scanner and then

728
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,479
we start scanning and weren't high risk

729
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:41,970
vulnerabilities now of course it took a

730
00:29:39,479 --> 00:29:45,509
little bit of time but the the

731
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:47,429
developers were fixing it and now those

732
00:29:45,509 --> 00:29:49,200
of you in revenue generated companies

733
00:29:47,429 --> 00:29:50,669
like the county isn't but they're still

734
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,289
overhead but those of you who work for

735
00:29:50,669 --> 00:29:55,769
companies that make money for a living

736
00:29:52,289 --> 00:29:57,629
the cost to fix a bug in during

737
00:29:55,769 --> 00:29:59,879
development is here

738
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:01,139
you know genetical has fancy grass with

739
00:29:59,879 --> 00:30:04,830
numbers but I'll just show you a nice

740
00:30:01,139 --> 00:30:06,928
little thing the cost to fix a bug after

741
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:08,999
it's already been written you know weeks

742
00:30:06,929 --> 00:30:12,419
ago and on my security team scans it

743
00:30:08,999 --> 00:30:15,239
it's five times as much so pay me now

744
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:17,849
pay me later but to pay me now or pay me

745
00:30:15,239 --> 00:30:20,460
later portion is much much higher and so

746
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:25,439
it more than covers an investment in

747
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:30,149
putting something in place okay who gets

748
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:33,119
calls from vendors now vendors are part

749
00:30:30,149 --> 00:30:35,908
of my team and I mean that as a general

750
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:37,439
security team not where I work but we

751
00:30:35,909 --> 00:30:40,919
all need vendors they have solutions

752
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,629
that can help us but my goodness you

753
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:45,720
know when you go to events and you sign

754
00:30:42,629 --> 00:30:47,998
up or you get a great white paper or get

755
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:51,059
business card I'm getting inundated with

756
00:30:47,999 --> 00:30:54,269
calls and emails and one of the

757
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:57,149
difficult things for all of us probably

758
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:59,059
I think this human species is saying no

759
00:30:57,149 --> 00:31:02,219
in a polite way

760
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:03,450
so I mean if I call someone I wouldn't

761
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,070
want them hanging up on me and I'm not

762
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:08,489
advocating to hang up on them but just

763
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:09,869
go hey it's not in my budget I'm working

764
00:31:08,489 --> 00:31:12,929
on other higher priorities right now I

765
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:14,820
love that concept I wish I could I've

766
00:31:12,929 --> 00:31:16,710
had unlimited budget I've got to

767
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:21,720
prioritize and you just have to be

768
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:23,820
willing to say it now decide on what

769
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,799
your priorities are and then look at the

770
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:28,859
solutions that are potentially available

771
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:30,418
based on your priorities right so if you

772
00:31:28,859 --> 00:31:32,009
have a list of ten things then someone

773
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:33,720
gives you a call about an 11 thing they

774
00:31:32,009 --> 00:31:36,029
haven't thought about but you already

775
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,169
did your risk assessment it's just not I

776
00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:39,480
don't have the time for it or if they

777
00:31:37,169 --> 00:31:41,070
call for number five just coincidentally

778
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,330
and then you're working on one and two

779
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,679
is projects and you've got three and

780
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:45,330
four lined up

781
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:47,160
might say well give me call six months

782
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:49,580
right just um just as this pointless

783
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:52,770
plus technology changes so quickly right

784
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:54,960
what you're putting in place today in a

785
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:56,730
year you'll be looking at okay so still

786
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,960
relevant it's still is there a better

787
00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:00,030
solution

788
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,980
maybe if I buy this other tool that

789
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:04,590
address these other issues I have I'll

790
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:05,940
combine it and to reduce I wouldn't have

791
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:09,330
to have three solutions I just have one

792
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:13,160
dashboard in one tool so it's difficult

793
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:16,020
to and not saying blow someone off but

794
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:18,630
keep in mind that if you were to field

795
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:24,210
all these calls then you wouldn't have

796
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:26,460
time to go to Shao Kahn so 3:30 I have

797
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:27,890
to meet with the system admin about the

798
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:30,660
network security vulnerability reports

799
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:32,070
all right so everyone in this room and

800
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:35,840
I'm sure your company is running network

801
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:40,800
scanning they're using some tool right

802
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:46,970
it's essential essential but what we do

803
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:51,690
is we compare our reports from our AV

804
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:54,450
tool our our SCCM

805
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:56,160
I can name that product which is our

806
00:32:54,450 --> 00:33:00,810
patch management tool from Microsoft

807
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:03,150
System Center from our network

808
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:06,870
vulnerability tool and from our ad

809
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:09,450
objects in our exchange and we look for

810
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:12,209
exceptions are there systems that are in

811
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:16,380
the network that are not showing up in

812
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:19,080
the AV tool whoa that means there's no

813
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:22,230
AV on those systems are there systems

814
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:25,800
without the SCCM client that are showing

815
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:28,410
up on our network that means they're not

816
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:31,950
getting any patches all right we also

817
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:35,730
have a port control product which will

818
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:40,430
only allow encrypted thumb drives to be

819
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:43,950
used on systems and we also have

820
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:47,550
encryption are there systems that don't

821
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:50,760
have the encryption tool agent on them

822
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:52,950
based on that become the dashboard of

823
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:55,350
that tool that are showing up in our

824
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:57,280
network scanning or an ad as objects

825
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:59,709
that's a huge problem

826
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:03,149
particularly for us if we get a laptop

827
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:05,520
stolen one of the first things we do is

828
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:06,730
try to find out what that person did

829
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,590
okay

830
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:10,780
is this a nurse oh you're interviewing

831
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:12,850
patients you have you have patient

832
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:14,470
information on that laptop okay is it

833
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:19,120
encrypted okay if it isn't that's a

834
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:20,949
breach and and with breaches come the

835
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,600
potential for fines and come the

836
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:24,639
potential for notifications even if

837
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:27,009
there's no fine the cost for

838
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,359
notifications can can really skyrocket

839
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:31,179
you would be surprised I mean just think

840
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:34,510
if you have a database with 500,000

841
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:35,230
records multiply that by the time to try

842
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:37,480
to track them down

843
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:40,800
you can't just mail letter you've got to

844
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:43,179
make efforts to reach those people so

845
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,550
it's important to compare all these

846
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:47,770
different reports and look for data

847
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:49,810
after this correlation and so we've been

848
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:51,550
doing that for several years and we open

849
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:52,750
up helpdesk tickets and then we say okay

850
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:55,510
you're gonna have to reimage or just

851
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:57,580
push out the agent sometimes the agents

852
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:59,650
will be pushed out initially and for

853
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:01,180
some reason there's a glitch it cracks

854
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:04,150
out you know because we know that if

855
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:06,490
these are not infallible systems no

856
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:08,770
matter what your OS is what you know

857
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:10,959
what the device is sometimes it doesn't

858
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:14,020
finish installing properly all right

859
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:16,060
other times a person you thought that

860
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:17,410
they no longer had admin rights on their

861
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:20,290
box but they did something now they

862
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:24,520
removed a client so it's important to

863
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:28,560
make sure to check this out 4:30 okay I

864
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:32,710
talked about dynamic security scanning

865
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:35,049
cross-site scripting still there input

866
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:36,970
validation problems sequel injections

867
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:39,400
still there this was discovered and and

868
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:42,240
a solution was put out there ten years

869
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:45,610
ago it's still there it's unbelievable

870
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,890
but with the proper tools and the proper

871
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:50,980
scanning schedule you can catch a lot of

872
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:53,710
this but let me just point out something

873
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:55,420
that's crucial never if you're in

874
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:56,410
security and if you're in you're an

875
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,660
application developer here you

876
00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:01,270
appreciate this don't take the report

877
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:03,149
the big report and here and give it to

878
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:05,500
your application development team

879
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:08,710
they'll look at this and go how you

880
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:10,090
crazy and you'll lose their cooperation

881
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:11,140
you lose their respect and they'll look

882
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:12,970
at you is like

883
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:14,589
that person away but if you take a

884
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:17,049
little time to vet it yourself look

885
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:18,670
through it boil it down to just the

886
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:20,980
couple of first the high-risk

887
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:22,450
vulnerabilities second make sure that

888
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:24,790
there's no mitigating controls that you

889
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:27,069
have in place are ready also make sure

890
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:29,140
that it applies to you right because

891
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:30,880
these tools are written for the generic

892
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:32,140
company you might have a totally

893
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,480
different environment where a couple of

894
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:35,650
these things were pointed out as issues

895
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,260
as high-risk Volyn pigs but they're

896
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:40,180
really not the way you work that's just

897
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:42,040
the structure that you have so you've

898
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:44,319
got to look at them and then you can

899
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:46,420
hand to them but I would still recommend

900
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,160
just to sit down when you have a report

901
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:50,920
sit-down with some of the app dev folks

902
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,870
and say okay let's go through these and

903
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:55,210
then as you speak to go oh we know what

904
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:57,339
but we don't use that we have a library

905
00:36:55,210 --> 00:37:00,160
instead of this area that looks like a

906
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:02,710
lack of discipline we take care of it

907
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,120
another way okay and so you discuss it

908
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:06,910
and then you hand the to and plus it has

909
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:10,390
same with the static scan it gives them

910
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:15,600
links on how to fix it as well so be a

911
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:15,600
teammate don't be a pusher of papers

912
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,210
because that's what you're doing telling

913
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:47,890
them what you're doing is wrong you code

914
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:51,450
like don't go to anyone and tell

915
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:51,450
their babies ugly right

916
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:59,930
okay executive management so I wanted to

917
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:02,170
propose a web app that will have an

918
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:05,450
internet front-end okay so where I work

919
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:08,030
doctors are very creative people very

920
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:09,740
intelligent typically and want to find

921
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:11,810
solutions and they'll be on an airplane

922
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:13,129
and read the the guy that's in the

923
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:15,620
pocket or that talked to another doctor

924
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:17,930
hey we're doing this great solution but

925
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:20,150
they never think about potential for

926
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:21,350
breaches of security unless my security

927
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:23,660
awareness is hitting them at the

928
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:27,680
executive level which is a challenge

929
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:29,359
right so I've got to make sure that as I

930
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,950
spoke about earlier right where's the

931
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,880
access coming from from this app as an

932
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:34,609
Internet

933
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:37,550
what's the platform who's gonna use it

934
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:39,050
so make make sure that you try to get in

935
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:42,830
there early on make sure that there's a

936
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:46,280
culture where you work where anything

937
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:49,009
that's proposed is run by security first

938
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:51,170
first step not just project management

939
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:53,660
office but Security's in there because

940
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:56,630
some things we just might shut down

941
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:58,520
right away okay that's not gonna work

942
00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:00,620
how about the MIT but have an

943
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:02,960
alternative it recommended right because

944
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:05,359
again we don't want to be the cop right

945
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:08,030
security is not like physical security

946
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:10,520
where we stop people our role is to help

947
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:11,960
them do it the right way help them get

948
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:15,560
their stuff out there but make sure the

949
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:18,290
security baked-in budget this is an

950
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:20,120
issue we talked with you know you raised

951
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:24,220
the question earlier about how do you

952
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:26,810
talk to the c-suite I mentioned again

953
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:30,770
build that culture let's try to get

954
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:33,020
visibility with the top level folks too

955
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:36,470
often security teams are buried low in

956
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:39,320
the hierarchy and then they report to a

957
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:42,379
CIO who reports to a head of a bureau

958
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:44,150
who reports to the executive team said

959
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:46,580
why the hell am i giving the title with

960
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:49,280
a C in it if I'm two levels away from C

961
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:53,000
and never talked to the C and we see

962
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:55,130
this all too often so one of the goals

963
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,200
of the head of security in every

964
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:59,630
organization is to have that time at

965
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,980
face time with the decision-makers the

966
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:02,210
people with the scratch who would

967
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,369
control the money would control the

968
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:05,740
budget

969
00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:09,519
understand risk and our goal is to

970
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:11,618
convince them of things a public service

971
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:13,390
announcement at 6:30 I have a meeting

972
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:16,150
about app set California which is coming

973
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:17,440
up this is real those of you had never

974
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:20,980
been there it's at the Annenberg Beach

975
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:24,900
House in January great talks great

976
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:30,880
sessions check it out app set California

977
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:31,869
some key parting concepts I have more

978
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,490
slides than these I'm not sure if I'll

979
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:35,920
have time to get to all of them but risk

980
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:38,258
management is the most important these

981
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,759
are my big eight all right those of you

982
00:40:38,259 --> 00:40:42,640
follow sports that's my big eight right

983
00:40:39,759 --> 00:40:45,279
here these are the things that help make

984
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,930
a successful see so they have these

985
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:51,809
slides already this is their laptop so

986
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:54,190
I'm sure you'll get them the large

987
00:40:51,809 --> 00:40:55,539
organizations get it they know risk

988
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:57,700
management they have they have a risk

989
00:40:55,539 --> 00:40:59,710
management team as a matter of fact

990
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:02,348
there are some CISOs that report into

991
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:07,420
risk management my personal opinion

992
00:41:02,349 --> 00:41:09,130
that's where we should be okay but risk

993
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:11,349
management is at the top level of the

994
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:14,499
company of our companies and they

995
00:41:11,349 --> 00:41:16,359
understand that risk is in pretty much

996
00:41:14,499 --> 00:41:18,069
in everything I talked to in one of the

997
00:41:16,359 --> 00:41:20,650
early slides about the risk that

998
00:41:18,069 --> 00:41:22,329
assessments we do driving to work and

999
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:25,720
again for the guys like you that don't

1000
00:41:22,329 --> 00:41:30,549
yeah okay

1001
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:32,348
as I said I believe risk management's

1002
00:41:30,549 --> 00:41:33,940
the best place but we see a hierarchy

1003
00:41:32,349 --> 00:41:35,920
that's different in all different

1004
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:38,769
companies I even spoke to a couple of

1005
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,930
people who have the CIO report to the

1006
00:41:38,769 --> 00:41:44,890
seaso which is enlightened if you think

1007
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:47,848
about it because if it's you know if a C

1008
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:50,288
so we pushed to a CIO and the CSO is

1009
00:41:47,849 --> 00:41:53,440
evaluating all the CIOs

1010
00:41:50,289 --> 00:41:55,089
stuff and he runs it by him you think

1011
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,900
he's gonna push it all up without

1012
00:41:55,089 --> 00:41:59,049
filtering it

1013
00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:00,369
he's evaluated by the people up there

1014
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:02,670
he's gonna push up well here there's all

1015
00:42:00,369 --> 00:42:06,119
the things they found wrong about me and

1016
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:08,799
it's a bad model it just doesn't work

1017
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:10,450
but we do the best we can with it you

1018
00:42:08,799 --> 00:42:14,019
build a good relationship with your CIO

1019
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:15,609
you you get him or her understanding the

1020
00:42:14,019 --> 00:42:17,140
importance of the stuff you're doing and

1021
00:42:15,609 --> 00:42:18,819
then they must support you what

1022
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:21,308
the initiatives you want to do so you're

1023
00:42:18,819 --> 00:42:24,849
gonna have to do a personality thing

1024
00:42:21,309 --> 00:42:28,029
bite your tongue sometimes but use your

1025
00:42:24,849 --> 00:42:30,940
wits and just you know you can't just

1026
00:42:28,029 --> 00:42:32,170
assume because it's Merritt and I'm

1027
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:34,029
doing the right thing that it will

1028
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:35,559
happen it just doesn't work that way in

1029
00:42:34,029 --> 00:42:38,470
the world enough of us have seen this

1030
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:41,260
happen where friends who were brilliant

1031
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:43,450
but they're not they say the wrong

1032
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:44,950
things and then the company says we

1033
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:47,140
don't want them they're like this guy is

1034
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:49,269
outstanding we see in sports you got an

1035
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:50,920
idiot it's talking about stuff you know

1036
00:42:49,269 --> 00:42:53,649
doing sit-ups in his garage but he's the

1037
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:56,260
best receiver on this decade and people

1038
00:42:53,650 --> 00:43:01,000
don't want him so it's same in you know

1039
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:02,500
and work right see so backgrounds come

1040
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,150
from a lot of different places most of

1041
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:09,450
us come up through IT not enough of us

1042
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:12,519
come up with web application background

1043
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:14,710
and that's one of the biggest areas for

1044
00:43:12,519 --> 00:43:16,299
potential risk right the way we as

1045
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:21,220
you've seen in my talk that I've

1046
00:43:16,299 --> 00:43:24,430
highlighted that a few times okay once

1047
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:26,200
you get to this level so much of it is

1048
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:27,819
about relationships I mean you've all

1049
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:30,609
probably experienced this to some extent

1050
00:43:27,819 --> 00:43:34,029
already who you know more than what you

1051
00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:36,578
know I like to think it's both right but

1052
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:38,200
it's who you know and and how you

1053
00:43:36,579 --> 00:43:41,289
present yourself which is really

1054
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:43,629
important one of the things that I

1055
00:43:41,289 --> 00:43:46,509
always do talking about the other

1056
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:47,890
direction no matter what is happening to

1057
00:43:46,509 --> 00:43:50,589
me and sometimes I head hurts from

1058
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:54,670
getting hit so much from up above I

1059
00:43:50,589 --> 00:43:56,769
don't push that down I keep my folks as

1060
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:59,710
happy as I possibly can I treat them

1061
00:43:56,769 --> 00:44:02,049
with respect and I don't overload them

1062
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:04,599
with work that's on me if something's

1063
00:44:02,049 --> 00:44:07,210
behind schedule I might ask them hey you

1064
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:09,460
know a little behind then you know if

1065
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:10,630
they feel respected if they feel like

1066
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:12,970
I'm giving them opportunities if I

1067
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:16,029
provide training for them if I bring in

1068
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:19,029
to conferences if I listen to their

1069
00:44:16,029 --> 00:44:20,619
ideas if I switch their roles around so

1070
00:44:19,029 --> 00:44:21,730
now they get an opportunity to work in a

1071
00:44:20,619 --> 00:44:23,619
different area that they weren't an

1072
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:25,269
expert in but they could learn something

1073
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:26,740
else then they'll feel that they're part

1074
00:44:25,269 --> 00:44:29,919
of the team and this is all really

1075
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:30,759
important I never forget how I've been

1076
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,250
treated

1077
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:37,270
I have to treat the people below me the

1078
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:39,250
same way but find out who the key

1079
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:40,770
players are in all the different areas

1080
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:42,760
in the business units where you work

1081
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:45,910
because you can't just look at an org

1082
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:47,620
chart you'll have one VP here who might

1083
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:49,629
run the whole show because the upper

1084
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:51,310
management they just want to sign the

1085
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:55,570
checks and go home and play golf you

1086
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:57,190
don't even know and I've seen that one

1087
00:44:55,570 --> 00:45:00,760
of the biggest challenges again because

1088
00:44:57,190 --> 00:45:02,190
most CISOs come from IT backgrounds at

1089
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:04,780
this level you're a business person

1090
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:06,850
right you got to give up a lot of the

1091
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:08,650
stuff you loved my friends make fun of

1092
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:11,440
me because I'm technologically a moron

1093
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:13,690
now I used to run networks I was an IT

1094
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:16,270
director but no one asked me to do

1095
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:17,980
anything so I was going to a session

1096
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:19,509
last year I had to bring a laptop anyway

1097
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:22,210
how do i configure this and the guys

1098
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:22,660
laughing at me like well I'm management

1099
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:29,860
he goes uh-uh

1100
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:31,750
okay so but along those lines on the

1101
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:33,790
business side you've got to learn what

1102
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:37,660
all the business units do and who are

1103
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:39,850
the key people most of us have some kind

1104
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:42,899
of regulatory requirements that we've

1105
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:45,460
got to follow make sure you follow that

1106
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:48,040
but the most important thing is know

1107
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:49,690
where your key information resides or is

1108
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:51,370
the shadow IT going on are their

1109
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:52,870
assistant or their people fill in credit

1110
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:56,770
cards out to AWS to build their own

1111
00:45:52,870 --> 00:46:00,250
little instances most likely yes

1112
00:45:56,770 --> 00:46:02,050
we're salespeople what PR people okay a

1113
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:04,150
lot of people in IT are introverts as

1114
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:05,740
the challenge right you have to be able

1115
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:08,350
to sell yourself

1116
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:09,879
many people have humility and we're

1117
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:12,100
modest and that's a it's a desirable

1118
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:15,010
human trait but we have to figure out

1119
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:17,200
how to make ourselves look important to

1120
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:20,830
the decision makers it's the way it is

1121
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:22,390
human nature right it's hard right I

1122
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:24,490
don't want to go hey look how good my

1123
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:25,779
security program is but when I present

1124
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:28,540
to upper management that's what I have

1125
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:30,060
to do because if they think I have a

1126
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:33,580
shitty program then I could have fund it

1127
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:35,290
so challenge their get yourself

1128
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:37,390
management training if you're at if

1129
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:38,950
you're rising up into that level don't

1130
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:41,980
just rest on your laurels I'm a great

1131
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:43,308
technologist you've got to learn how to

1132
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:45,799
be a manager

1133
00:46:43,309 --> 00:46:48,409
and as you know your you're giving up

1134
00:46:45,799 --> 00:46:50,719
your technical chops right something's

1135
00:46:48,409 --> 00:47:04,729
got to take up your time it's this so

1136
00:46:50,719 --> 00:47:08,689
don't discount this yes okay so where I

1137
00:47:04,729 --> 00:47:11,808
am I have 5,000 total people in the

1138
00:47:08,689 --> 00:47:14,989
department so I'm like them SMB

1139
00:47:11,809 --> 00:47:16,999
basically and although we're part of the

1140
00:47:14,989 --> 00:47:20,269
county as a whole

1141
00:47:16,999 --> 00:47:23,209
I do not supervise the security ops

1142
00:47:20,269 --> 00:47:24,348
people that manage the firewalls right

1143
00:47:23,209 --> 00:47:27,558
but I do everything else that you've

1144
00:47:24,349 --> 00:47:33,549
seen in this presentation so I have four

1145
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:39,949
direct reports that's it that's my team

1146
00:47:33,549 --> 00:47:42,880
all right so we've got our hands full so

1147
00:47:39,949 --> 00:47:46,249
this is important I've got to wrap up

1148
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:48,349
speak business ease so you've got to

1149
00:47:46,249 --> 00:47:50,408
learn the language of the business the

1150
00:47:48,349 --> 00:47:53,869
upper management the executive team

1151
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:56,449
c-suite they do not care if you show

1152
00:47:53,869 --> 00:47:59,059
them reports on how many times your

1153
00:47:56,449 --> 00:48:00,859
firewall caught things or what was

1154
00:47:59,059 --> 00:48:03,109
stopped at the gate wait they couldn't

1155
00:48:00,859 --> 00:48:04,549
care less they don't care about your a/v

1156
00:48:03,109 --> 00:48:08,328
they don't care about any tool don't

1157
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:11,419
mention tools just talk risk talk

1158
00:48:08,329 --> 00:48:13,819
dollars okay by implementing this

1159
00:48:11,419 --> 00:48:15,049
solution I can save this because we

1160
00:48:13,819 --> 00:48:16,939
don't have to do this and this and

1161
00:48:15,049 --> 00:48:20,029
people can now do this in this or I've

1162
00:48:16,939 --> 00:48:22,279
enabled us to now access this

1163
00:48:20,029 --> 00:48:25,069
information on the web securely which

1164
00:48:22,279 --> 00:48:27,769
saves so much effort and money where now

1165
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:29,599
we're much we are our clients are much

1166
00:48:27,769 --> 00:48:31,459
happier because of this tool that I was

1167
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:33,949
able to talk to them at the highest

1168
00:48:31,459 --> 00:48:36,469
level possible because a they don't know

1169
00:48:33,949 --> 00:48:38,269
anything you're talking about and more

1170
00:48:36,469 --> 00:48:40,009
importantly they don't care and if you

1171
00:48:38,269 --> 00:48:45,158
keep doing it they'll never invite you

1172
00:48:40,009 --> 00:48:45,159
back thank you

1173
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:55,460
we have we have time for a question or

1174
00:48:50,300 --> 00:49:06,020
two all right anyone else want to ask

1175
00:48:55,460 --> 00:49:08,120
anything yes which ecstatic okay again

1176
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:10,070
this is not an endorsement there's all

1177
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:14,060
the solutions out there I just happened

1178
00:49:10,070 --> 00:49:15,380
to pick up fortify which is now HP but

1179
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:18,440
that was like six years ago

1180
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:21,170
so I wouldn't go buy anything I said

1181
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:23,560
because as I said technology changes you

1182
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:23,560
had something

1183
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:29,170
I

1184
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:36,830
like what would you recommend

1185
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:40,089
how to be pretty much like that

1186
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:40,090
territory back

1187
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:44,859
since they're the ones with the money to

1188
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:47,210
go back to do the risk for you even

1189
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:50,910
though you know

1190
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:52,849
okay if I'm doing security assessments

1191
00:49:50,910 --> 00:50:04,080
and audits and they're doing compliance

1192
00:49:52,849 --> 00:50:06,660
let him have first thing invite him to

1193
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:07,890
go to lunch psychology remember the

1194
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:10,109
salesmanship stuff that I've talked

1195
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:11,759
about invite him to lunch just talk

1196
00:50:10,109 --> 00:50:13,740
about I said hey you know it's great

1197
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,330
what you're doing let me let's team up

1198
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:17,189
because from my side of it I have a lot

1199
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:18,630
more technical stuff that we're working

1200
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:21,450
on we can work together and really

1201
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:23,790
protect the company and you know I think

1202
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:25,680
it's it's a win-win mmm this is

1203
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:27,420
something on top of my head but the

1204
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:29,580
dialogue is important don't look at them

1205
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:30,720
as like they're stealing my stuff look

1206
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:41,940
at him as like okay I'm gonna have to

1207
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:43,290
team with him yes sir okay so my

1208
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:46,320
backgrounds a little different I have a

1209
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:48,029
degree in business and I worked in

1210
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:50,010
business for a while so I kind of

1211
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:51,900
meandered my way in as a matter of fact

1212
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:53,640
I used to be an architect and I was a

1213
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:55,230
project manager running jobs the the

1214
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:59,670
building Ark thing not the security

1215
00:50:55,230 --> 00:51:01,740
architect so so you come in different

1216
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:03,720
ways so um you know that that's

1217
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:05,549
different for me I had that I had that

1218
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:07,890
already I was managing when I was 25 I

1219
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:11,450
was managing 18 people already so I had

1220
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:11,450
to learn kind of on the fly

1221
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:20,299
folks around disciplines of execution

1222
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:24,060
leadership styles frameworks there that

1223
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:28,320
you can choose

1224
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:28,320
mismanagement there also goes there

1225
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:38,400
yeah and there are courses that you can

1226
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:40,230
sign up for and in universities I forgot

1227
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,670
the name that we're a few that some

1228
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:43,319
friends of mine have have taken and they

1229
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:46,550
may enjoy them well you can get a

1230
00:51:43,319 --> 00:51:50,819
masters if you have free time

1231
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:52,079
one more good this is kind of a

1232
00:51:50,819 --> 00:51:53,279
plaintiff question because I've seen

1233
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:55,380
this in several organizations that I've

1234
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,210
worked with now you talk about how you

1235
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:58,650
one of the things you think about the

1236
00:51:57,210 --> 00:52:01,349
most or keep you up at night is fishing

1237
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:03,450
right one of the things that I've seen a

1238
00:52:01,349 --> 00:52:06,540
lot of companies like every company ever

1239
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:08,640
Portland is that the policies they teach

1240
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:10,079
people to implement to avoid you know

1241
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:12,270
putting on a phishing email or something

1242
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:14,160
like that are the same those same things

1243
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:15,390
that we tell people to signature or know

1244
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,770
that something's efficient you know or

1245
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:19,230
what they're using internally when

1246
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:20,790
they're sending messages is people yeah

1247
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:22,079
so like hey we need everybody to go

1248
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:23,490
there go in and update this tax

1249
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:25,770
information or we need everybody go do

1250
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:27,540
this training where's your link right

1251
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:29,190
and it's it's very very easy for

1252
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:32,400
attacker so I guess my question would be

1253
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:33,780
what if anything are you doing to negate

1254
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,609
those kinds of practices cuz that's

1255
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:37,410
something that's a higher level where

1256
00:52:35,609 --> 00:52:39,060
people need to coordinate I never see

1257
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:40,500
that happen or it just doesn't end up

1258
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:43,920
getting em connected

1259
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:45,690
yeah so just paraphrase you tell me

1260
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,369
don't click on links don't open

1261
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:49,500
attachments but there's something you

1262
00:52:47,369 --> 00:52:51,930
need them to do you send an email with a

1263
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:56,640
link or an attachment what's a person to

1264
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:57,868
do right so it's it's education it's a

1265
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,450
tough ones a good question because I've

1266
00:52:57,869 --> 00:53:04,050
grappled with that and you know if we

1267
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:05,819
have one email that sends everything out

1268
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:07,800
of course there's email spoofing IP

1269
00:53:05,819 --> 00:53:09,240
spoofing there's stuff like that so

1270
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,140
there's nothing that's foolproof but

1271
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:13,040
there has to be some way to communicate

1272
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:16,020
with people and so you know we basically

1273
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:17,520
just try to make sure that they do and

1274
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:20,190
one of the other things that we do is we

1275
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:24,119
are using a tool that for every link

1276
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:26,190
it's sent to the third-party that

1277
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:27,930
assesses that link if it's a known

1278
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:29,910
malware site they block it

1279
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:31,828
plus they every we have a URL we write

1280
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:34,109
so instead of just having a clickable

1281
00:53:31,829 --> 00:53:36,420
link it it redirects it to that site and

1282
00:53:34,109 --> 00:53:38,009
add some extra character so it helps

1283
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:40,020
with from that perspective so there's

1284
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:42,510
it's a combination of technical and

1285
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:44,940
procedural nothing's foolproof though

1286
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:45,510
right we know last statement that I'm

1287
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:49,290
out of here

1288
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:53,190
you can't secure your environment 100%

1289
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:55,560
impossible right if management says can

1290
00:53:53,190 --> 00:54:00,270
you secure our system against attacks we

1291
00:53:55,560 --> 00:54:02,609
go we could get close but if you have

1292
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:05,280
good detection good incident response

1293
00:54:02,609 --> 00:54:09,109
network segmentation you minimize the

1294
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,109
damage thanks everyone

1295
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:14,829
[Applause]
