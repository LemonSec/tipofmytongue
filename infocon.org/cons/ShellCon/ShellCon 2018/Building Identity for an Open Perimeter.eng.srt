00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,130
all right so we have thank you everyone

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:07,250
for coming we have building identity for

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:10,019
an open perimeter with Tejas Durham she

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:12,330
pages is a senior security software

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:13,980
engineer at Netflix Teja specializes in

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,360
security and is focused on corporate

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,830
Identity and Access multi-factor

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,480
authentication adapt to the

9
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,930
authentication and user focused security

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,240
of scale

11
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:26,480
please welcome page us to shell Khan

12
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,479
[Applause]

13
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:35,190
alright finally we are up and going so

14
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,709
yeah so my name is stages I'm a senior

15
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,089
security software engineer at Netflix so

16
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,950
basically net fixes and micro service

17
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,989
environments that we are building out

18
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,420
services and tools that focus on making

19
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:50,370
our like applications really secure and

20
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:52,770
safe and talking about safe and all the

21
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,419
issues that we've had so far I had a 32

22
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,000
character like password for my gmail

23
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,870
account so it just took forever to get

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,829
this thing going on

25
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:04,470
anyways so primarily we are the things

26
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:07,740
that I focus on are on Identity

27
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:10,080
Management Access Management single

28
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,419
sign-on and that includes adaptive

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,880
authentication and we want to make our

30
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,930
security story really user focused so

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,908
user focus security as well before we

32
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:24,030
dive more into the actual identity

33
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,830
landscape at Netflix itself I just want

34
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,310
to give a quick peek into what our

35
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:33,060
ecosystem is all about and see how our

36
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,740
story Falls align so we have apps that

37
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,140
are actually managing the entire

38
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,970
ecosystem of our Studios that basically

39
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,540
manages the Phils life cycle starting

40
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:45,179
from inception pre-production production

41
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:47,040
the online yards of a production then we

42
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,720
have applications that basically manage

43
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,220
our relationship with our device

44
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:55,250
partners so they to get the the to

45
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,420
basically get Netflix on all devices

46
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:59,009
then we have applications that manage

47
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,409
our relationship with Internet service

48
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:02,850
providers all over the world so that you

49
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,610
can get the most awesome experience on

50
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:08,000
Netflix when you go to natural

51
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:10,100
right and we have a range of engineering

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,220
applications that's helping us drive

53
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:15,920
really fast to help solve all our

54
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,240
business use cases and we have a range

55
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,309
of SAS applications so what we're

56
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,600
talking about is right now 700 plus

57
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:24,410
applications and the number is

58
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:26,000
constantly on a on a progression so so a

59
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:30,650
lot of applications and various use

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,320
cases like all of you we want to make

61
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:35,120
sure like we are making making Netflix

62
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:38,989
really safe especially if the apps at

63
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,660
which rate at which they're working one

64
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:43,190
thing that makes this different is our

65
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:46,370
culture and I'll talk about like how our

66
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:49,609
culture plays a role in how we focus on

67
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:51,709
security specifically so two years ago

68
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:55,940
this was a typical setup that we had we

69
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:58,400
had secure network parameter and and

70
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,410
then we had manage devices so anyone who

71
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,880
actually wanted to get connected to our

72
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:03,770
applications they basically jump on a

73
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:07,130
VPN and then connect with these

74
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:08,930
applications using their identity and

75
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,549
that basically protects all the

76
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:15,260
sensitive data that we have an ecosystem

77
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:17,060
that we but what used to happen in that

78
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,380
same time period is people connect from

79
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,930
any open network like you go to

80
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,250
Starbucks and you can freely connect any

81
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:24,950
only thing you have to do is jump on a

82
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,360
VPN and access applications so we

83
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,700
started questioning yourself whether we

84
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,660
really want to trust the network that

85
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:34,700
you connect to access our applications

86
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:37,910
and this is where our location

87
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:40,850
independent security approach helped us

88
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:42,290
move away from that mindset so if if if

89
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:44,090
if you guys are aware of like the

90
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:47,179
googles beyond Corp model this is kind

91
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:49,400
of aligned to that as well so we said ok

92
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,410
let's great let's let's not worry about

93
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,560
like what network you can come from

94
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:57,260
let's treat all Network as insecure and

95
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,400
treat them accordingly another

96
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,489
interesting aspect and this is where our

97
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,640
culture comes into picture is freedom

98
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:07,220
and responsibility so what we believe is

99
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,750
people people really strive with freedom

100
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,810
and they are really like worthy of the

101
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:14,420
freedom so you can go into any store

102
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:16,579
bile device let that be a laptop iPad

103
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,959
phone whatever in connector

104
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:21,709
connected the network and then you just

105
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:25,060
can access our applications so then we

106
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:27,980
were this is kind of contrary to what we

107
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:31,100
were in the set up in terms of manage

108
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:32,990
devices now we have any kind of devices

109
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,550
connecting to access our application so

110
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,940
we're like let's just not worry about

111
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:40,910
manage devices anymore and all we have

112
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:42,560
is in secure networks unmanaged devices

113
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:45,139
and people are just trying to get access

114
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,810
to our applications so how do we go from

115
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:50,930
the two year ago story to where we want

116
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:52,070
to actually reach so that's what today

117
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,200
I'm going to cover in terms of how we

118
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:58,280
have gone how do how have you covered

119
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:59,630
this particular distance so far but if

120
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,409
you just take a look at the from a

121
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:05,750
bird's eye view what it is is there are

122
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:08,270
users who are basically trying to access

123
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:10,250
applications and when they're trying to

124
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:12,889
access applications what we want is some

125
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:15,020
sort of a really strong proofing of that

126
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:17,690
identity we have strong authentication

127
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:19,130
and that needs to account for a range of

128
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,120
things and we'll cover in depth like

129
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:23,719
what are the range of things that we

130
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:26,330
look out for but but it needs to cover a

131
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,190
range of things once a user is strongly

132
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:31,580
attenti catered to these applications

133
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:34,130
then applications they basically want to

134
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:36,080
consume the same identity right they

135
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:38,150
might want to take that identity

136
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,039
information and use it for a whole bunch

137
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,659
of different purposes it could be giving

138
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:43,940
access you to access to sensitive

139
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,950
resources or it might be giving you

140
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,900
using those same information for

141
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:50,719
applying fine-grain authorization rules

142
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:53,690
right that can be anything so we want

143
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,070
some sort of way for for streaming this

144
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:58,639
medical identity information down to

145
00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:00,139
applications and in all of this we would

146
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,910
have increased like the security story

147
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:05,060
around it but how can we make all of

148
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:07,310
this frictionless both from an end-user

149
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,470
perspective as well as applications who

150
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:11,900
are who wanted who are wanting to make

151
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,910
the application secure right so so

152
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:17,719
that's a really high level what we would

153
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:20,150
want to achieve by this so at the core

154
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:24,110
of this is the identity itself right so

155
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:26,090
in our in our ecosystem the the identity

156
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,340
landscape is broken down into two main

157
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:29,940
categories one is the corporate

158
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:33,000
landscape veteran

159
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:35,520
all our employees contractors and see

160
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,290
his folks who are basically bucketed

161
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,120
under so we term them as workforce

162
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:44,130
identity and then we have partners and

163
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,680
partners is quite wide in our ecosystem

164
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:48,930
and these are people who are responsible

165
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,730
for various facets that are helping

166
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:53,190
drive our business so they are basically

167
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:55,320
managing these our users or our partner

168
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:56,940
users who are basically helping us with

169
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,830
our localization subtabs

170
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:01,320
like pre post production these are

171
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:03,150
studio users who are actually working on

172
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,950
our productions are these are device

173
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:06,570
partners or open connect partners so all

174
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:08,310
of those we term them as partners and

175
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:12,900
how really high-level they're broken

176
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:14,390
down into these two main categories and

177
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:18,870
we'd really don't want this to happen

178
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:21,450
wherein we have identity so silos and

179
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:23,460
that just not leads to duplicate

180
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:25,650
identities but in general like how do we

181
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,659
go about securing all these underlying

182
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:32,609
different storage if at all that was a

183
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:35,160
roadtrip ended we went up going so what

184
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:36,930
we have done is streamline that again

185
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,960
into two different buckets at the very

186
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:42,300
top on the workflow side we have our

187
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,859
identities originate from our HR system

188
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,650
workday and they are streamed into

189
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:50,280
Google for which we use primarily for

190
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:51,690
our authentication purposes on the

191
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,539
Parden side if you have a homegrown

192
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:57,690
solution and we we put them into our

193
00:07:54,540 --> 00:08:00,960
homegrown directory service and all

194
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:02,430
those identities are housed there so

195
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,430
great so now we have unified like these

196
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:07,650
two classes of identities and in general

197
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:09,960
if I talk about numbers we have 130

198
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:13,049
thousand plus identities in that

199
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,400
ecosystem overall and it's on a constant

200
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:17,580
progression considering the rate at

201
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,960
which our productions are growing so so

202
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:22,830
we are talking about like quite a large

203
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,239
population as such so now how do we go

204
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:26,940
about establishing like some sort of a

205
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,190
really strong trust in who in the

206
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:35,280
incoming authentication requests in our

207
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:37,919
in our Minar at Netflix basically

208
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,559
so the core of it is obviously the first

209
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,640
factor Varon basically you go about

210
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,900
using your user name and credentials and

211
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:48,930
and that's how you start like the

212
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:51,270
establishment of the trust process but

213
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,770
I'm guessing like we all are on the same

214
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:56,490
page in terms of how passwords are

215
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:59,100
really horrible things and there there

216
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:01,140
have been like a data breaches that we

217
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:05,010
can go about reading about in terms of

218
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:08,970
how a social engineering and malicious

219
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:12,120
software as well as credential stuffing

220
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:15,180
is so common right so those are the most

221
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:19,170
common practices father to get access to

222
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:23,910
somebody's account and if you see like

223
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:25,770
the top three breaches that have or the

224
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:27,780
categories of breaches you will see the

225
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:31,500
same character same things applying

226
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:34,860
there as well another interesting fact

227
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:37,340
is if you if you check out the this

228
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,839
particular research from Telus on like

229
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:43,310
54% of the consumers they are actually

230
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:46,589
using five or less passwords so and

231
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:48,420
130,000 plus identities and on a

232
00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:50,880
constant progression and this particular

233
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:53,250
number just throws us off right so

234
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,189
clearly if the first factor is not the

235
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:58,470
only factor we should all be focusing on

236
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:03,780
we need to add some additional stuff on

237
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:05,820
that so and what do we use like what

238
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,410
would make sense for our business use

239
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:10,470
case considering we has such wide

240
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:11,790
diverse population of users so I'll just

241
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:14,130
talk through like some of the methods

242
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:16,050
and we use the range of methods

243
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:20,610
available and apply them based on

244
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:23,400
various use cases starting from starting

245
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:26,130
from again not the ideal methodology to

246
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,860
use is a one-time passcode that is

247
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:31,680
basically sent to your device using SMS

248
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:33,330
or a phone call

249
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,280
I'm guessing everyone is aware of like

250
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:38,010
what other risk associated with this

251
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:40,949
around phone number to take over sim sim

252
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:43,380
k covers man-in-the-middle attacks all

253
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:46,140
different possible range of attacks that

254
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:48,780
are possible using phone based one-time

255
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:51,600
passcode so clearly not an ideal silly

256
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:55,020
solution but it's still if you don't

257
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,810
have a second factor enable this is

258
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:59,550
still a good or at least an initial step

259
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:02,640
that would take you in the right

260
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:04,770
direction but obviously in our ecosystem

261
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:08,370
that clearly doesn't fit our use cases

262
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:11,010
so that goes out of picture then the

263
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:13,980
next progression is using the time-based

264
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:15,930
one-time pass codes where you have an

265
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,700
Authenticator app you set that up and it

266
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,890
spits out a code which are valid for 30

267
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:23,610
seconds right but still exposed to

268
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:25,410
phishing attacks still exposed to a

269
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:30,000
man-in-the-middle attack so it totally

270
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:31,770
not not the right thing to go about the

271
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,570
next thing and again like the

272
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:36,480
Authenticator based approaches again

273
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:39,450
like not an ideal approach for us so we

274
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,800
would like to make it more predominant

275
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:43,380
in our ecosystem there are some more

276
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,319
stronger methods so push notifications

277
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:48,030
these are great like deep row the other

278
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,100
methods they don't provide enough enough

279
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:51,390
context in terms of who and what kind of

280
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,090
operation that you're trying to carry

281
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:55,770
out right so push notifications gives

282
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:57,480
you that capability you can include as

283
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:59,880
much contextual information like hey

284
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,110
this is stages trying to access like

285
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,320
this particular sense of the financial

286
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:06,090
application from San Jose is this like

287
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,650
really you please verify that right so

288
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:09,690
that kind of contextual information it

289
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:11,490
helps make people perform the right

290
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:15,840
decisions right together to approve or

291
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:20,070
deny the transaction so so this is so

292
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:22,020
this gives you that capability so this

293
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:25,680
is this fits a large population of our

294
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:28,439
user base and where we want to go strive

295
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:31,609
towards is the next method where we want

296
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:34,730
to at least on the corporate landscape

297
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:36,960
u2f is what we would like to actually

298
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:39,560
make sure like all our employees are

299
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:41,820
using right so in this specific

300
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:44,280
methodology you have a security key you

301
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:46,350
would plug it into your device and you

302
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:49,620
would register that specific security

303
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:51,390
key strongly a phishing resistant like

304
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:54,000
there's absolutely not no way possible

305
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:55,350
for that as your credentials are really

306
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,920
bound to the origin where you registered

307
00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:01,250
right so so really super secure and

308
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:04,910
establishes our really strong

309
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:08,269
in terms of who the user is and and a

310
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:10,069
great second factor option so we have

311
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:11,899
like all these different options

312
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:14,599
available we pick and choose like what

313
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:16,459
makes sense obviously security keys

314
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,779
might not make sense for a really high

315
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:19,699
sensitive production where people are

316
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:21,709
working on what other options we can use

317
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:24,109
so we we are basically flexible in terms

318
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:26,119
of what are the options we go about

319
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:28,189
applying alright so again like it's

320
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,529
something if you're if you're have the

321
00:13:28,189 --> 00:13:33,170
second factor enable there are different

322
00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:34,579
options available probably it'll be

323
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:38,810
better to make a decision in terms of

324
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:40,969
what fits your business use case but we

325
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:42,589
have second factor let's just apply it

326
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:44,569
for everyone right like that would have

327
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:45,350
just been so simple let's just apply it

328
00:13:44,569 --> 00:13:47,599
for everyone

329
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:49,370
multi-factor out everyone every time any

330
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,610
application you go

331
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:54,319
let that be I'm a users trying to access

332
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:56,029
like a simple lunch many application

333
00:13:54,319 --> 00:14:01,069
let's just multi-factor out them right

334
00:13:56,029 --> 00:14:02,629
or somebody's trying to go to our kind

335
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:04,628
of sensitive like some sort of a data

336
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:07,250
application but you're getting data out

337
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:08,589
that might probably make sense but if

338
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,069
you're going to a financial application

339
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:12,050
absolutely yes

340
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:15,139
like let's just apply it for them so

341
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:17,779
their various application sensitivity

342
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:23,209
aspect as well as who the users

343
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:24,980
what kind of the sensitivity aspect of

344
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:27,008
the request that's coming in let's take

345
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:30,470
that into account to make our decisions

346
00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:33,290
so this is where we have invested

347
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:36,759
heavily into our adaptive authentication

348
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:39,110
story so obviously we don't want to

349
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:42,589
multi-factor out everyone every single

350
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:45,500
time but let's how do we go about like

351
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:48,139
making it so dynamic that it makes sense

352
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,699
we're actually it's prompted so what we

353
00:14:48,139 --> 00:14:51,470
take an approach is we start take an

354
00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:52,939
approach of what our address rings we'll

355
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:55,250
think about when they are trying to

356
00:14:52,939 --> 00:14:56,750
target us right what are the different

357
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,939
things or different patterns that they

358
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:01,819
would be looking out for to basically

359
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:04,790
get into any of our applications so we

360
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:08,839
start thinking about us us in that

361
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:11,300
direction and there are quite a lot of

362
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:13,350
things we take into account and we have

363
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:16,500
tried have made it more

364
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:18,000
for risk-based approach and we establish

365
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,920
a risk level associated with every

366
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,930
authentication request that is coming in

367
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,979
and what are the factors that we account

368
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:28,829
for one unique aspect that we have added

369
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:32,040
into our ecosystem is the likelihood of

370
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:35,640
a user visiting an application so how

371
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:37,290
that works is me as stages I have had

372
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,660
previous transactions going to

373
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:42,930
application a which is a launch many

374
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:45,089
application then AWS maybe and then some

375
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:46,620
severely sensitive application and what

376
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,940
kind of access pattern that have

377
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,150
established in terms of kind of

378
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:53,270
applications that I go about visiting

379
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:55,410
and what are my other peers actually

380
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:57,090
doing as well like what are the kind of

381
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:59,610
applications that these users are going

382
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:03,060
about so very we have a machine learning

383
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:04,980
pipeline where we taken all previous

384
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:07,310
authentication transaction and inject it

385
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:11,100
into that pipeline which constantly

386
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:13,380
re-evaluates what uses typical access

387
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:16,170
pattern might be right so that's

388
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:20,850
interesting now we can kind of predict

389
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:23,250
what is might end up going to and what

390
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:26,910
is the likelihood of that and I'll give

391
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:29,550
it a score all right so apply that score

392
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:32,579
and then we take into account more

393
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:34,979
things right so if I'm an attacker what

394
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:37,350
I might be thinking of doing so I might

395
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,540
be trying to laterally traverse through

396
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:40,800
different applications right so I'm

397
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,439
trying to fire off like different

398
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,300
applications and every place I go I'm

399
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,400
getting blocked by the second factor

400
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,810
prompt right I might not be completing

401
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,829
this transaction I'm just might be

402
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:53,760
abandoning those requests or I might be

403
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:57,120
initiating those push but there might be

404
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,920
failed or after even after the push it

405
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,470
gets a user gets a notification user

406
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:03,750
rejects the request right so there are a

407
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:05,850
lot of patents that can be detected

408
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:10,109
based on previous transactions that have

409
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:13,980
had and we use that into another factor

410
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:16,859
to apply a risk associated with that and

411
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,720
if we figure out like hey you abandon or

412
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:20,669
your fear like previous X amount of

413
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,490
requests we definitely think that we

414
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:25,050
should be stepping up for you for next

415
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,230
few transactions just to verify it's

416
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:30,320
really you right

417
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:33,170
so that's a that's another factor which

418
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:36,320
adds a higher score if he if you

419
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:39,800
determine that right then the device

420
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,600
itself so this particular aspect is

421
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,210
interesting so now I've used this

422
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,040
specific device like just to establish

423
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:49,070
my trust and I've done successfully

424
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,690
second factor so let's just trust us

425
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:52,310
give some sort of a trust to this

426
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:55,220
particular device so what we end up

427
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:56,840
doing is we create a session cookie and

428
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:59,480
we stick it to the specific device

429
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:03,260
itself so that gives kind of some sort

430
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:05,960
of an assurance for for for where I have

431
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:08,720
previously logged in from right so that

432
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,490
adds a little bit of score giving us

433
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,340
some extra assurance on where this

434
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:16,790
request is coming from

435
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:18,980
we still would want to keep it per app

436
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:21,740
as well if there are really sensitive

437
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:23,720
applications and and we want to regular

438
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:26,240
at a regular cadence we would want to

439
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,000
step up in that case we would want to

440
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,440
take into account like what is that app

441
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,630
looked like and what can be - so

442
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,910
application owners can go and specify

443
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:36,530
that hey I want my applications my

444
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:38,240
application to be doing step up at a

445
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:40,430
regular cadence or every single time

446
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,080
right it all depends what type of

447
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:45,350
application it is so but definitely

448
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,659
something to account for then the

449
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:49,570
location aspect where your

450
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:52,910
authentication request is coming from

451
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:54,830
and there are quite a few in things are

452
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:57,380
on this aspect as well we take into

453
00:18:54,830 --> 00:19:00,980
account if you are coming from a really

454
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:03,260
risky location which we deem as risky we

455
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:05,480
would outright deny you will not even

456
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:08,090
like wait for you to step up with just

457
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:10,790
outright deny you but if you're coming

458
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:12,110
from unknown vocations previous known

459
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,490
locations and all of a sudden you're

460
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:15,020
going to a different location then it

461
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:16,940
might make sense for us to add some sort

462
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:20,180
of an extra score in addition to all the

463
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:23,300
other facets to it right and that would

464
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:29,240
basically add to the to our risk over

465
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:31,250
assessment and finally this is another

466
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:34,130
interesting aspect that we have added is

467
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:36,530
an app known as stethoscope and this is

468
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:38,240
open source so what we have taken is a

469
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:40,670
different approach to manage the by

470
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,260
so we the traditional managed devices of

471
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:44,270
collecting device information all the

472
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:46,960
time and crunching information doesn't

473
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:51,379
fit our use case we wanted to be more of

474
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:53,000
a user driven model wherein we want to

475
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:56,000
empower people with the right amount of

476
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,820
information and so this is a local

477
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,150
native application available for mac and

478
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:04,070
Windows where it will give it'll provide

479
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:06,590
users the right enough of information

480
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:08,149
and it'll guide people through like what

481
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:10,220
you would need to make your device

482
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:12,500
secure what we think are the right

483
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:15,170
things right so feel free to check it

484
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:20,600
out and give us some feedback and it's

485
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:21,770
it's on Netflix's github so but that is

486
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,050
so good like we have a native

487
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:26,120
application it is telling us some

488
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:28,580
information but how do we make it really

489
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,979
valuable to our adaptive authentication

490
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:32,480
story right so what we have done is we

491
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:34,910
have fired this off right and during the

492
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,480
authentication process itself we're in a

493
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:40,850
real time it'll query out your device

494
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:42,980
and it will tell us what exactly is the

495
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:45,110
state of your device and in this case

496
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:47,090
firewall is not enable it'll tell you

497
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,320
firewall is not an e-book it will give

498
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:52,280
you instructions on how you would go

499
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:54,800
about enabling firewall you do that and

500
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:56,450
yeah you click on a check again button

501
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,310
and there you go like your device is in

502
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:00,350
a state wherever you think it should be

503
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:03,290
and now you can go about like accessing

504
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:06,919
your application so a different way of

505
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:10,610
us thinking about how around the manage

506
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:13,400
devices aspect and and and how do we use

507
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:15,620
that information so now great so we have

508
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,180
so many different factors that we have

509
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:20,870
accounted for and those are some of the

510
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:24,800
factors that have highlighted but so now

511
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:29,000
we can make smarter decisions due to our

512
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:31,490
multi-factor re-and make it right but

513
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,980
it's super complex and how do we make it

514
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:36,140
simple that it's easy for people to

515
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:38,990
actually integrate into our into our

516
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:40,610
solution right all great security

517
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:46,250
offerings but it comes at the expense of

518
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:48,580
how we can make it frictionless so this

519
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:50,200
is the answer to that is mutual

520
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:52,360
you know the house of cards character

521
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,580
that's where its name from so it's

522
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,949
basically a federation hub which is

523
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,970
built on top of ping federate again like

524
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:01,090
ping Federer is something that we just

525
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:03,750
use because it helps us it fits our

526
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:06,519
needs but there are all there are great

527
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:08,649
identity providers out there and all of

528
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:10,840
them they offer great offering so feel

529
00:22:08,649 --> 00:22:12,908
free to check them out but yeah so

530
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,889
that's basically a federation hub where

531
00:22:12,909 --> 00:22:17,590
the previous winners showed where and we

532
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:19,779
have injected like the device hell jack

533
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:24,039
detection and all the adaptive a story

534
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:26,740
it's it's hooked up there so well how

535
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:29,860
does it go so we have the first factor

536
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:31,870
obviously Soviet radar to Google for for

537
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:33,850
the odd process and we fed right out to

538
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:36,879
the internal directory service right for

539
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:39,070
auditing our partners as well so that

540
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,200
and the other interesting aspect is

541
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:42,580
because we have so diverse population it

542
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,590
is important like we have customizable

543
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:47,740
login experiences to fit different use

544
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:49,240
cases so this is where the the hub also

545
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:51,970
comes into picture where we based on

546
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,950
different user population we can present

547
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:57,070
things which are which make sense for

548
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:59,080
that user population then the second

549
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:00,779
factor there are so many providers out

550
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:05,379
there again which one to use

551
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:08,529
so in our ecosystem we use a three

552
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:10,210
predominantly so far so Google obviously

553
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:14,010
when you're accessing or anything inside

554
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:17,200
G suite is when you use Google's

555
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:20,289
multi-factor options in there and then

556
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:23,260
we use duo to perform our own step up on

557
00:23:20,289 --> 00:23:25,899
top of Google right so we use that based

558
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:28,419
on our adaptive what we will fire of duo

559
00:23:25,899 --> 00:23:31,120
in that case and for our partner

560
00:23:28,419 --> 00:23:33,789
landscape we use 2 leos awti right

561
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,199
because that helps because our partners

562
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:39,010
are kind of fitting in the consumer

563
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,470
space so it fits that specific model and

564
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:43,658
the entire adaptive authentication is

565
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:45,580
it's this real-time happening everything

566
00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:47,049
happens real-time based on the

567
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:49,240
sensitivity of the requests that we are

568
00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:51,370
receiving so it's act up direct directly

569
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:54,519
during the authentication process itself

570
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:56,678
so all of these things are hooked up

571
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:58,179
during the art process and these are

572
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:01,970
range of micro services that we fire off

573
00:23:58,179 --> 00:24:04,080
calls to during the process

574
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:05,669
so as that dose when there are other

575
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,399
providers out there and it might fit

576
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:10,110
other bees need this is octaves

577
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,750
like rule-based definition of what it

578
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:14,520
makes sense for enabling like

579
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:16,679
multi-factor ah

580
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,990
looks pretty promising so for you to

581
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:20,640
check that out and even like one login

582
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:22,500
right so they have a kind of similar

583
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:26,789
risk based assessment approach in there

584
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:28,350
so you as an organization if if if

585
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:29,549
second factor is something that you have

586
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:31,230
enabled but you want to make it smarter

587
00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:36,679
than this might be another great thing

588
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:40,110
to have as well so great now we have

589
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:42,299
strong up we have the our identity

590
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:43,918
provider in there but now how do we how

591
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:47,730
do these apps actually integrate into

592
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:50,190
into this particular solution we

593
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:52,679
definitely don't want to have central

594
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:54,210
admins who are managing these

595
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:56,190
integrations like working with all these

596
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:58,140
different engineering teams managing

597
00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:00,870
these integrations with them we wanted

598
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:03,169
to make our engineers empower engineers

599
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:05,939
so basically carry out themselves so

600
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:09,149
this is where we have built self-service

601
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:12,840
tool which helps register open ID

602
00:25:09,149 --> 00:25:15,239
connect clients and it kind of takes a

603
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,949
delegated approach model where apps can

604
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,330
define owners and every everyone can

605
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:22,710
actually manage those applications and

606
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:24,809
integrations so you integrate that this

607
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:27,960
way and it provides a range of

608
00:25:24,809 --> 00:25:29,760
configuration options in terms of how

609
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,190
you would go about configuring your

610
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:35,429
grants how you do go about configuring

611
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:38,399
your redirect your eyes scopes and other

612
00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:41,100
aspects which I'll go over in a bit but

613
00:25:38,399 --> 00:25:43,110
yeah so this is this was one way for us

614
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:47,209
to help our engineers move forward

615
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:48,899
faster and not be a blocker for them

616
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:50,520
another interesting thing in our

617
00:25:48,899 --> 00:25:52,529
ecosystem is any new micro service that

618
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,000
comes up there are certain base level

619
00:25:52,529 --> 00:25:56,490
things that they get which we term as

620
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,279
base server right and one of the things

621
00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:02,039
that they get by default is Apache so

622
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:04,049
now that adds an interesting twist to

623
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:05,580
our story is like we have a self-service

624
00:26:04,049 --> 00:26:07,620
tool which is helping drive the

625
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,899
integration but that can actually spread

626
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:12,299
out Apache configuration automatically

627
00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:14,520
which apps can take and add it to their

628
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:19,379
applications so we use morado

629
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:22,830
an IDC the passion module for helping

630
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:25,140
applications integrate and and make

631
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:30,330
their application secure so this is what

632
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:31,770
we use but obviously that would work in

633
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:33,899
an ideal situation where we cover a

634
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:35,550
hundred percent of the use case but then

635
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,110
we have a range of other applications

636
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,680
where Apache might not even make sense

637
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:40,320
right

638
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:42,870
we have no TAS app we have single page

639
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,429
applications and and range of

640
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:46,919
technologies and at Netflix you can

641
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:50,730
you're free to use any technology as

642
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:53,310
long as it helps you push the bar to the

643
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:55,400
next level right so in all these cases

644
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:57,810
obviously Apache doesn't make sense and

645
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:00,780
you end up having an Apache avoidance

646
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:03,450
syndrome right so so how do we tackle

647
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:04,410
this situation so in the past what we

648
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:06,750
have done is we have recommended

649
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:09,180
applications where is certified like

650
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:11,850
open IT connect client libraries and

651
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:15,860
that had worked great but it still

652
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:18,389
exposes us to different aspects one is a

653
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:20,219
it's some extra effort which engineers

654
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:22,380
have to do and they need to understand

655
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:24,900
the terminologies they need to get

656
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:27,480
themselves tuned to that and be is like

657
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:30,150
they need to configure it in the right

658
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:32,730
way without leaving certain routes which

659
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:34,890
an attacker can get through so it still

660
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:35,310
leaves us some room where things can go

661
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:38,220
wrong

662
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:41,340
right and how I can we close that gap as

663
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:43,220
well so over the last one year we have

664
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:45,389
worked with Amazon very closely on

665
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:49,380
pushing authentication right to the load

666
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:51,750
balancer itself so and great news around

667
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:54,270
that is as of May this year this has

668
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:56,520
been GA from Amazon and now you can

669
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:59,550
enable authentication directly at the

670
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:01,800
application load balancer itself and

671
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:03,510
it's quite simple in terms of what

672
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,310
Amazon today provides in terms of

673
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:08,870
certain base level configuration you

674
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:11,700
just inject there and and specify the

675
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:13,590
the port and route on which odd needs to

676
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:17,100
be enable and there you go like authors

677
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:18,840
enable for you right and it has two

678
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:21,270
different of flavors it you can hook it

679
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,820
up to your own IDP or you can hook it up

680
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:26,090
to Amazon's canítö as well so two

681
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:28,220
different approaches so far by

682
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:33,439
it's a great step forward in the right

683
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:35,540
direction but that's so tedious for an

684
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,799
engineer to go into an Amazon console

685
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:38,928
and taking all the configuration and

686
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:42,379
apply themselves where can we take this

687
00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:44,420
to the next level so the answer to that

688
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:46,970
is vinegar which is our continuous like

689
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:49,940
delivery platform if you guys are not

690
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:51,049
are using or haven't heard of it you

691
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:54,049
should definitely check it out as an

692
00:28:51,049 --> 00:28:56,240
awesome continuous delivery platform and

693
00:28:54,049 --> 00:28:58,850
and it's a multi cloud provider as well

694
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,900
so check it out so what we have done is

695
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:02,418
we have strongly integrated with

696
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:04,450
spinnaker internally with the

697
00:29:02,419 --> 00:29:07,790
self-service tool that tool that we have

698
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:10,730
so this is a snippet of how you would do

699
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:13,700
it on spinnaker you go and configure try

700
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:17,080
to configure the listener and there and

701
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:20,929
enable the authentication rule in there

702
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:22,939
and double configuration clicks and you

703
00:29:20,929 --> 00:29:25,429
specify the base level attributes in

704
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:27,020
here all right so this is the OSS

705
00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:29,000
version what I'm screenshots are

706
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:31,700
presented there's a different flavor for

707
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,500
our internal use wearin this is still a

708
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:36,890
few configuration elements that you have

709
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:39,620
to fill out but internally what we have

710
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:41,780
done is when you enable the menu click

711
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:43,729
on that specific button it strongly tire

712
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:46,040
integrates with our internal tool and

713
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:48,110
the only thing that you need to do is

714
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:51,080
just click that button and everything is

715
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:53,689
wired out automatically for you so it's

716
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:55,309
just and what we termed that as a zero

717
00:29:53,690 --> 00:30:00,250
configuration where you just click and

718
00:29:55,309 --> 00:30:02,540
things up working as expected so that's

719
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:05,360
that's how we have tried to take our

720
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:06,830
approach Apache works great for a lot of

721
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,600
applications if things don't work then

722
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:12,230
yes like load balancer is the way to go

723
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:14,030
and and if you don't care about anything

724
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:16,010
apart from just having authen able then

725
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:17,720
that's the way to go if you want like

726
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:19,460
some really custom configuration that

727
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:24,950
you want to do then yeah sure like let's

728
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:26,630
let's talk about Apache so so great so

729
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:29,960
now we have all enabled on pretty much

730
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:33,980
every application in our ecosystem and

731
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:36,559
that means I've done a strong are done

732
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:38,570
step up and required and I've accessed

733
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,520
this particular application but does

734
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:41,830
that mean that these

735
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,320
the engineer should be able to access a

736
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:45,490
financial application versus they just

737
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,800
say engineer trying to access some

738
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:49,330
engineering application right like do we

739
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:52,090
need to have some other level of

740
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:56,129
assurance around that and that's where

741
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:58,480
we authorization comes into picture so

742
00:30:56,130 --> 00:31:03,040
authorization is also very crucial to us

743
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:05,140
in terms of who gets access to what so

744
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:07,899
at the really high level in the same

745
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:09,429
cell service tool you have you can apply

746
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:12,190
some authorization rules right there

747
00:31:09,429 --> 00:31:14,830
itself indicating that hey this

748
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:17,140
application it's available for any class

749
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:18,939
of particularly any class of users or I

750
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,890
want to like restrict it down to like

751
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:23,530
certain class of folks right a certain

752
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:25,420
user base certain group base certain

753
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:27,670
other user attributes like totally you

754
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:29,110
can do that and it's the same

755
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:33,580
self-service tool you will end up using

756
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:35,159
all right this might work great to have

757
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:37,540
like authorization out of box available

758
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:40,210
but it might not work for pretty much

759
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:42,190
every class of application we would

760
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:43,720
still want some sort of a way to

761
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:46,090
communicate the identity information

762
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,440
down to these applications so that they

763
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:49,780
can actually apply some other fine-grain

764
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,640
authorization rules if they like to so

765
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:53,620
another interesting aspect that we have

766
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:56,080
added is hey tell us what attributes you

767
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:58,570
want us to package for you right

768
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,370
so when you are configuring a client you

769
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:02,590
would indicate what attributes you care

770
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:04,959
about and we will package that up into

771
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:07,178
an access token and pass it down the

772
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,950
application or you can if you're on the

773
00:32:07,179 --> 00:32:10,630
client side you can just call out to the

774
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:14,290
user info endpoint and you'll get the

775
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:16,809
same kind of attributes so so yeah so

776
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:17,980
different classes of attributes and

777
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:21,940
everyone can just pick and choose

778
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:24,160
whatever they works for them so this

779
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:26,590
helps us achieve like some sort of an

780
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:28,960
authorization aspect as well there are

781
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:31,290
other other internal services that are

782
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,240
primarily focused in our ecosystem doing

783
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:34,840
even finer grain authorization but this

784
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,140
provides

785
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:42,639
applications in general authorization

786
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:45,850
that they can really opt into so so yeah

787
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,740
so the the story around like we were two

788
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:49,389
years ago we were at one state and now

789
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:51,980
we have no parameter no manage devices

790
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:53,870
and the core ingredients that we

791
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:56,419
for that aligns with our security

792
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:58,070
stories hey we need to have unified

793
00:32:56,419 --> 00:33:00,590
identity make sure we don't have

794
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:03,409
duplicate identities apply single

795
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:06,379
sign-on and have authentication enable

796
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:08,740
for every application then make a strong

797
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:10,640
authentication including adaptive odd

798
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:13,299
authorization and range of other factors

799
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:17,390
so so that's our story in terms of how

800
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:21,250
we have taken our approach and made our

801
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:24,470
security story pretty strong so far and

802
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:26,000
that's about it I guess so one thing I

803
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:27,440
want to highlight here is we are hiring

804
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,330
we are outside as well we have a booth

805
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:35,240
so feel free to check out jobs at like

806
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:36,860
jobs on AFRICOM and if you have anything

807
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:41,570
that interests you feel free to hit me

808
00:33:36,860 --> 00:34:02,870
up or reach out to us outside yeah take

809
00:33:41,570 --> 00:34:05,928
questions there are different approaches

810
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:07,459
to that so far will not enable it might

811
00:34:05,929 --> 00:34:08,840
not make sense to what type of

812
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:11,060
application that you're trying to go to

813
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:13,399
but if it's a really sensitive app and

814
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:16,070
we feel like all these ten factors that

815
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:20,179
we have is absolute must then we will

816
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:21,830
enforce a mandatory required yeah you

817
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:24,350
can totally we can we can customize

818
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:26,690
based on that but as it stands today we

819
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:28,520
it's a more more of an informational

820
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:30,168
perspective at least from a range of

821
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,418
applications that we have hooked up set

822
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:35,899
scope it but yeah the long-term vision

823
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:37,429
is we want to make our base rules

824
00:34:35,899 --> 00:34:38,629
indicating like which what is mandatory

825
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:43,179
and when it's not required

826
00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:43,179
right so totally yes yeah

827
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:49,219
any of them you mentioned if there's

828
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:50,540
multiple methods for mfa obviously some

829
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:54,790
of the Foresters none there's like

830
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:57,060
really by SMS is secure effect

831
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:57,060
did

832
00:34:59,749 --> 00:35:16,799
yes I had it otherwise so I offer SMS as

833
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:18,660
any factor from anyone but we have kept

834
00:35:16,799 --> 00:35:20,400
it as an option if there is a really

835
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:22,558
high profile user coming in and you want

836
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,239
to really enable it for so in a below

837
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:25,739
the second factor aspect and we don't

838
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:28,200
have to have that entirely compass on

839
00:35:25,739 --> 00:35:31,559
aspect then we will still try to better

840
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:33,569
than nothing but as it stands today we

841
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:35,760
don't n able SMS for any any class of

842
00:35:33,569 --> 00:35:38,969
population yeah

843
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,969
[Music]

844
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,930
uber lockdown

845
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:56,859
so we that's what we have moved

846
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:59,319
ourselves away from the entire manage

847
00:35:56,859 --> 00:36:01,180
device aspect completely and the way we

848
00:35:59,319 --> 00:36:02,890
we think that we should educate we

849
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:04,808
believe in educating people and this is

850
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:07,150
where a culture comes into picture so we

851
00:36:04,809 --> 00:36:10,990
believe like as long as I tell you that

852
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:12,910
hey looks like your laptop is not locked

853
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:15,220
your screen lock is not enabled or your

854
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:17,078
device is not encrypted we will give you

855
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:20,200
informational messages using the

856
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:21,430
stethoscope application but if we think

857
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,038
that you're trying to access some

858
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:26,710
sensitive application and we think that

859
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:28,390
you should enable that before we can

860
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:30,400
trust your have a strong assurance on

861
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:35,890
your device we will try to block you

862
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:39,269
till you fix that particular aspect you

863
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:39,269
mean on the actual endpoint itself

864
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:48,430
so again with the business of encrypting

865
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:50,770
it but like out of the box obviously Mac

866
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:52,779
provides that device encryption aspect

867
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:54,609
so we will let people know that hey

868
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:57,849
please enable that particular device

869
00:36:54,609 --> 00:37:00,160
encryption aspect in there and and

870
00:36:57,849 --> 00:37:26,980
enable so we don't encrypt specifically

871
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:29,680
like devices like you can we don't we

872
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:32,380
don't care about that that much as long

873
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,259
as we so basically the way our approach

874
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:36,730
is a little different in that space is

875
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:38,319
we encourage people not to store

876
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:40,030
sensitive information on your devices

877
00:37:38,319 --> 00:37:43,240
right we want everything on the other

878
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:45,789
cloud and and specifically in our

879
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:47,500
ecosystem use drives heavily so there's

880
00:37:45,789 --> 00:37:50,700
no reason for you to have things on your

881
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:55,480
device even if you are working remotely

882
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:58,598
or even I know fine scenarios but having

883
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:00,430
said that there there might be outliers

884
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:02,500
who will be still doing it but our

885
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:04,089
approach to that is make sure screen

886
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,380
lock is enabled make sure device

887
00:38:04,089 --> 00:38:08,589
encryption is enabled on your local

888
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:10,930
device and and that's how we would

889
00:38:08,589 --> 00:38:18,210
recommend you during the live of

890
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:18,210
indication process yeah sure yeah

891
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:29,680
you mean to say in the end point itself

892
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:29,680
Oh

893
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:38,750
so in a way I will take cost as an

894
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:41,720
aspect but in a way of especially around

895
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:44,660
the securing the network parameter it's

896
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:46,910
just too involving to have that kind of

897
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:49,609
mindset available right in terms of

898
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:53,180
having strong tunneling available

899
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:56,330
between between our whatever like the

900
00:38:53,180 --> 00:39:00,140
corporate network itself but our

901
00:38:56,330 --> 00:39:02,480
approaches to that is regardless of what

902
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:04,040
I what the security parameter I have

903
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,870
within veneer within the net flix

904
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,640
boundaries that defeats the purpose when

905
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:10,460
you go outside the boundary anyways

906
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:12,879
right so so yeah is like why don't just

907
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:15,980
make our applications more secure and

908
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:19,160
and another thing is like getting on to

909
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:21,740
VPN is to conversing right it's just too

910
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:24,049
annoying to to be using that so why not

911
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:25,549
just go away from that model and why not

912
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:27,770
just make things available everything

913
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:30,110
available externally and there's no

914
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:32,930
reason for us to be worried about as

915
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:35,600
long as we can detect anything wrong

916
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:42,500
that's gonna happen and any wrong thing

917
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:44,270
that can impact us I don't think the

918
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:48,290
cost is a factor that we take into

919
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:52,520
account yeah so so yeah so we believe in

920
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:56,060
like having stronger detection using our

921
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:58,810
data more efficiently and cost is the

922
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,810
last thing that we care about

923
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:15,500
we I mean not an increase in attack

924
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:18,540
traffic or applications but we

925
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:21,690
definitely have more detection going on

926
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:23,490
now so and based on our metrics we we

927
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:26,190
can clearly identify like various

928
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:29,220
malicious patterns that we can out like

929
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:31,530
outright see and how successfully we've

930
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:34,379
been able to like block those outright

931
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:36,810
access completely so that just gives us

932
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:37,800
a more assurance aspect in terms of the

933
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:39,210
investments have been the right

934
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:59,600
investments that we have done so far

935
00:40:39,210 --> 00:41:02,730
yeah any questions so interesting aspect

936
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:04,980
and a few colleagues on the back over

937
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:08,130
giving me a smile but a Lea is an

938
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:10,140
interesting aspect we as Netflix at

939
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:11,730
least on the corporate side we are our

940
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:14,100
vision is to move away completely from

941
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:16,110
ad and there are outlying like legacy

942
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:18,569
applications especially their tasks in

943
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:20,820
speed of apps that still rely on ad

944
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:23,700
specifically lookup so what we have done

945
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:26,310
is a different model where and we are

946
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:29,930
using Google as a primary IDP for the

947
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:32,610
for the employee side of it and we

948
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:34,980
stream that identity information down to

949
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:36,780
our core PD itself and that is primarily

950
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:39,780
used for lookups no more authentic

951
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:41,940
Asians carried out but yes so Google is

952
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:44,970
also working towards having Google LDAP

953
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:46,350
as a core thing it's all still a it's I

954
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:50,009
think be beta or something yeah that's

955
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:53,299
what yeah so we've been closely working

956
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:53,300
with Google on that aspect as well

957
00:41:54,450 --> 00:42:00,328
in the office or probably come back out

958
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:01,859
like a stem career and begin or so you

959
00:42:00,329 --> 00:42:05,760
can force it to away even if somebody

960
00:42:01,859 --> 00:42:08,670
sits in one yeah yeah because as I told

961
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:12,030
you even our net even our Wi-Fi is

962
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:14,369
considered to be like a non-secure or

963
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:16,470
network itself so regardless you're

964
00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:20,030
coming internal-external yes it's the

965
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:20,029
same policies apply yeah

966
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:39,990
to access it based on what you see so we

967
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:42,120
categorize or risk or is based on a low

968
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:43,770
medium high kind of category all right

969
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:46,140
and so each of those factors they go

970
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:47,880
into that low medium high category and

971
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:49,140
if for example let me just pick up a

972
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:51,600
location aspect if you're coming from

973
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:55,529
let's say a risky location let's say

974
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:58,500
North Korea right in that case we would

975
00:42:55,530 --> 00:43:00,990
bump up the score really high and that

976
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:03,330
becomes the most factor of that account

977
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:05,879
accounts for the risk factor right so

978
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:08,250
every facet is gots a classified as low

979
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:22,860
medium high and based on that we rank

980
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:24,090
the scores it goes by app to app as well

981
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:25,500
so if you're going to a lunch many

982
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:29,520
application it should be like really low

983
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:31,350
bar right so and by default every

984
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,530
application is considered to be in a top

985
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:36,630
category and you can downgrade yourself

986
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:38,460
to a low category application so any new

987
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:40,470
application comes out it gets the most

988
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:41,880
secure option out out of the box and

989
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:44,850
then you can downgrade yourself based on

990
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:47,220
based on your decision making but yes

991
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:49,110
and the reason why I've kept it final

992
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:50,819
green so that applications can actually

993
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:52,950
make the right decisions using our

994
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:55,260
self-service tool itself so that they

995
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:57,600
can indicate like what kind of level we

996
00:43:55,260 --> 00:44:00,120
think we should set for application so

997
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:02,670
that's why it gives us more flexibility

998
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:04,529
to tweak around but everyone just gets a

999
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:17,630
base level if you're not if you have not

1000
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:17,630
tweaked out right deny

1001
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:31,000
yeah all of this is homegrown solution

1002
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:33,340
like what I just says Spectre and any

1003
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,930
factor that he saw its so we have one

1004
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:36,910
particular micro service that's doing

1005
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:39,580
all the decision-making that talks to

1006
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:42,250
our internal identity provide providers

1007
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:43,840
in this case like Google as well as our

1008
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:46,870
internal directory service to get like

1009
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:47,920
user data as well so so yeah so there's

1010
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:50,440
micro service that does a

1011
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,820
decision-making and then talks to other

1012
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,760
micro service to carve out like the

1013
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:55,660
different multi-factor providers as well

1014
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,960
yeah but everything is homegrown

1015
00:44:55,660 --> 00:45:00,310
solution another thing I wanted to

1016
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,170
highlight like all of these different

1017
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:03,370
passes that we cover like I'm also

1018
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:04,930
looking for feedback if anyone is

1019
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:07,450
interested in any aspect which we have

1020
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:16,960
not open sourced yet we can chat about

1021
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:18,750
it and what questions alright thank you

1022
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:24,270
so much

1023
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:24,270
