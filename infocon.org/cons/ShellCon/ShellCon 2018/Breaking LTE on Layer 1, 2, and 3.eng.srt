1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,870
Elte I'm layers one two and three with

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:09,000
Matt is an engineering walk home working

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:16,020
on cellular security research he's

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:19,740
welcome back thank you all right

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,939
yeah like he just said we're gonna sell

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,849
your security research and

7
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,619
countermeasure so to answer here's to

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,269
common questions just be real quick six

9
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:31,560
foot eight and I didn't play basketball

10
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:34,110
I played volleyball and then also what I

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,199
was just talking about broadcasting a

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,440
licensed spectrum is against the law you

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,190
doing it

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,829
use a Faraday cage and or a bag they

15
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,410
work pretty well and also this

16
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:48,059
presentation is just information that's

17
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,190
public already no there's no new secret

18
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:51,839
sauce here it's just all other it's like

19
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,699
a collection of other people's research

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,730
so everybody else everybody's research

21
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:59,550
is sourced on the slides I highly

22
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,980
suggest you go and look up the stuff

23
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,750
that I'm sourcing so anyway a brief

24
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,009
overview of LT architecture for people

25
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,180
who are not familiar with cellular we

26
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,640
just think we were just talking about a

27
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,260
particular slice of this the full

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,570
architecture so we don't to talk about

29
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,720
the whole backhaul but just this I have

30
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,699
this this little model here and we have

31
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,110
also a couple acronyms we use or a

32
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,630
couple terminologies we use in cellular

33
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,710
so it's good to go over this so when we

34
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,439
say UE we're talking about user

35
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:28,408
equipment so your foam IOT device

36
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,750
anything that has a modem you know B

37
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:32,759
that's the base station and then we have

38
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,990
this concept of access stratum that

39
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,159
deals with everything that has to do

40
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,048
with the UE and the e node be

41
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,270
communicating over the air and with the

42
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:40,680
radio and then there's this concept of

43
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,929
non access stratum that's anything that

44
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,600
the U is communicating to the backhaul

45
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:48,979
to the actual back parts of the network

46
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,000
not dealing with the radio and the

47
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:52,979
backhaul you have this important thing

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,079
is called the mobility management entity

49
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:56,880
this is that the system that tracks for

50
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,740
your your UE your cell phone moves

51
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,449
around so the network needs to know

52
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,110
where the phone is at all times to be

53
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:06,119
able to deliver service at it

54
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:07,320
MMB handles that and then HSS the home

55
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:09,389
subscriber server that has the

56
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,190
information about are you if subscriber

57
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:12,660
for this ah for the cell you'll never so

58
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,470
if you're if you pay forty bucks of rise

59
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,870
in a month

60
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,630
you're in that server somewhere saying I

61
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:21,810
pay 40 bucks I'm a semi subscriber

62
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:25,350
this is the evolved packet core you Tran

63
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:27,150
is there is the technology of the access

64
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:29,340
to the radio so we evolved UMTS

65
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:32,160
terrestrial radio access network and

66
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,480
then the last thing MZ I know if you

67
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,280
guys are familiar with MZ catchers or

68
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,660
EMC leak MZ is the international mobile

69
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,450
subscriber identifier so a lot of these

70
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:44,460
attacks have to deal with getting the a

71
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:46,950
user's MZ so anyway we got the LT

72
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:53,190
protocol stack here so this is just like

73
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:54,510
a really quick overview of LTE so we're

74
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,060
gonna be mostly talking about physical

75
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,140
layer here and then we're gonna be

76
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,480
talking about the packet data

77
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,859
convergence protocol here and then

78
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,630
lastly we'll talk about radio research

79
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,950
control and not access stratum don't

80
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:08,010
worry about what these are just yet

81
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:10,799
we'll talk about it when we get there

82
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:12,720
so LTE is actually pretty secure once

83
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,970
this completes once the authentication

84
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,440
key agreement completes so we're dealing

85
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:18,720
with an over-the-air protocol so we have

86
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:23,940
to start from a place that's not secure

87
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:26,940
and then eventually we we authenticate

88
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:30,020
each other the user and the network and

89
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:34,800
then we set up encryption so essentially

90
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:37,350
fast-forwarding through this the UE here

91
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,510
decides to attach to the network sets up

92
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:44,100
an RC connection so RC is radio resource

93
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:46,709
control radio control then we then we

94
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:49,500
send a non access stratum attach request

95
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:51,510
with the subscriber identifier the

96
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,269
network goes and checks if you are valid

97
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:56,640
subscriber and generates some

98
00:03:54,269 --> 00:04:00,950
authentication vectors here sends I back

99
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:04,609
down and the the ue gets now a

100
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:08,100
authentication request with this token

101
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:10,980
there's there's a shared secret key on

102
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:14,280
both ends of this so in the SIM card

103
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:18,060
it's not your MZ it's called K it's a

104
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,970
cryptographic key that is used to set to

105
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:23,280
check this authentication token that the

106
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,960
network generated also with K at the

107
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,369
very end K he's never transferred but

108
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,370
numbers are generated from K

109
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:34,320
yes sorry I skipped a little bit ahead

110
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,760
and that so because of the Ueno's k and

111
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,230
the network knows k that you is able to

112
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,750
validate that this authentication token

113
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:41,250
is correct when it does a response it

114
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,990
generates its own response to the

115
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,570
challenge and now we have mutual

116
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:46,470
authentication both ends have just

117
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:48,060
cryptographically verify that they both

118
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:51,270
know this the shared secret k so a

119
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,680
symmetric key that allows us to set up

120
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,760
encryption so you actually have two

121
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,830
layers of encryption and integrity

122
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,080
protection LT you have one that actually

123
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,609
deals with Nass the the network so the

124
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,490
backhaul and then you have one that

125
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:04,230
deals with with access stratum RC so

126
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,280
there's there's encryption between you

127
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:08,870
and the tower and this we Crips in

128
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,820
between you and the network so anyway

129
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:13,680
before the aka completes this is all of

130
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,969
our tax base so while you're while

131
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,530
you're attaching and you're

132
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:19,500
synchronizing and you're and you're

133
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:20,880
getting the aka ready an attacker can

134
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,920
send any kind of non authenticated

135
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,960
message to you and actually control you

136
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:28,190
e behavior so this is this is bad this

137
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,390
is why all these things become possible

138
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:31,440
anybody is able to send this message to

139
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:36,510
your phone over the network in your

140
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:39,000
phone obeys following protocol the

141
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:40,140
people who made the protocol 3gpp they

142
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,620
had a primary objective of

143
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:47,340
interoperability first and security

144
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:49,890
third fourth something so that's bad I

145
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:52,669
mean you you kind of have to make it

146
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:54,599
something that works first and it's also

147
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:56,100
it's also amazing that we have these

148
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,860
devices that can beam data out of the

149
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,060
sky I mean it's really crazy how do you

150
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,780
think about it but we just take it for

151
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,600
granted

152
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:06,770
but security is not possible in this

153
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,460
initial attack space you can't

154
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,900
immediately start communicating with

155
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,250
somebody over the air and have a secure

156
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:15,090
connection you have to negotiate first

157
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:16,890
so anyway and lastly this is the last

158
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:19,440
part of the overview part there's

159
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:21,440
numerous actors in this in a space and

160
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,200
it's a tax base so there's hobbyists

161
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,120
there's research for I'm at an

162
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,940
increasingly amount of criminal and

163
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,260
we'll talk about this in the end

164
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:33,660
software-defined radios are getting very

165
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:36,750
cheap people who have some very little

166
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,580
know-how can start making money using

167
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,470
these exploits so we're seeing a lot of

168
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,570
increase in criminal activity

169
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:44,010
law enforcement and espionage you guys

170
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,120
are familiar with empty catchers all

171
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:49,860
that stuff you hear about on the news

172
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,750
that's mostly those things are a hundred

173
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,730
thousand dollars apiece stingrays and

174
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:58,350
stuff like that that's mostly you know

175
00:06:53,730 --> 00:07:01,290
law enforcement CIA whatever you'll see

176
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:02,120
these a lot around airports federal

177
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:10,890
buildings

178
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:13,230
DEFCON and yeah embassies so yeah big

179
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:15,570
news I think on April the Department

180
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:17,310
Homeland Security was was complaining

181
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:18,750
that they were finding MZ catchers or

182
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:21,060
surveillance devices around the DC area

183
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,200
and I made like national news people

184
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,390
that work in this space were like well

185
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,849
duh we already know this but it was like

186
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:28,169
big deal back then lastly we're going to

187
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,400
talking about jamming so jamming is

188
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:31,950
technically under like the realm of

189
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:35,729
electronic warfare so you know in an

190
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:38,130
actual like hot war you can deploy some

191
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:40,050
of these techniques to to bring down do

192
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:41,820
your LTE in an area or stuff like that

193
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:44,190
so that being said we'll start with

194
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:46,680
layer one so we'll start with Jamie I've

195
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:50,070
really simplified this part and it's

196
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,080
actually not my expertise so apologies

197
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:54,960
ahead of time but we'll try to get

198
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,500
through this so the goal of jamming is

199
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:02,909
to inject interference into the into

200
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:04,860
your target into the receiver so when

201
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:06,450
you inject interference you drops what's

202
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,130
called signal-to-noise ratio it makes it

203
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:10,250
hard for the receiver to extract the

204
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:14,190
signal from the noise and interference

205
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:15,600
so LT in the downlink uses this

206
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:17,219
technology this is this amazing

207
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,130
technology called orthogonal frequency

208
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:22,919
division multiplexing or OFDM that

209
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:24,570
allows your like very very efficient use

210
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,840
of the cellular or the the

211
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:29,040
electromagnetic spectrum it allows for

212
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,090
you know these crazy bandwidth that we

213
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,130
have on our phones like your phone

214
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:34,760
basically like broadband speed most of

215
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:36,838
the time hopefully right all that stuff

216
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,330
really really cool technology but it

217
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:40,890
relies a lot on synchronization and

218
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,690
click your phone and the network are

219
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:47,670
constantly optimizing and synchronizing

220
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:50,400
with each other that makes it a problem

221
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:52,530
if you jam or if you interfere with this

222
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,410
this constant negotiation that's

223
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:56,529
happening on with the net

224
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:59,230
work that you can break LCD pretty

225
00:08:56,529 --> 00:09:00,939
easily so there's different types of

226
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:03,670
jammers there's like a barrage jammer

227
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:06,100
all these other type of jammers with LTE

228
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:08,620
but since the since we're using OFDM and

229
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,720
all these other modulation techniques

230
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,980
all the stuff you have you actually need

231
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,899
to build a smart jammer

232
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,920
you can't just well you can but it's

233
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:17,379
very inefficient

234
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:19,750
you just have to broadcast with like a

235
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:21,310
huge amount of power trying to jam LT

236
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:25,029
because LTE is very very resistant to

237
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:27,550
like to try to sorry excuse me

238
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:29,889
so you want to build a smart jammer

239
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:31,209
because essentially it allows you to

240
00:09:29,889 --> 00:09:33,189
synchronize through those control

241
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:36,069
signals and then you Jam them and then

242
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:37,930
you break you break the there's like a

243
00:09:36,069 --> 00:09:41,979
cascading effect keeper will see what's

244
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:44,800
going on there's also so your phone is

245
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:46,930
actually usually in what's called RC

246
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,209
Idol the modem is usually turned off and

247
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:51,008
waking periodically to wake up to see if

248
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:51,579
I have any traffic and then go back to

249
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:53,889
sleep

250
00:09:51,579 --> 00:09:56,410
so when you're if you keep the modem

251
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:58,899
from going from RC Idol to RC connected

252
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:00,730
state you effectively Jam as well as you

253
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:01,959
keep the motor you can't get to connect

254
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:04,630
the state you can't get data you can't

255
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:05,920
get any can't get any service and then

256
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,329
if you really really Jam something you

257
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,040
could cause radio link failure you'd

258
00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:10,359
best this basically we have to start

259
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:15,339
over from scratch radio link failure is

260
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:16,899
bad so okay well just quick slide or

261
00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:20,050
thing I'll freaking see people you have

262
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:22,660
you have these uh you have all these sub

263
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:27,399
carriers here and this is in the

264
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:30,339
frequency domain this way right on this

265
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:33,069
platform or on this this is a time

266
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:35,019
frequency lattice so you have multiple

267
00:10:33,069 --> 00:10:35,439
sub carriers that are orthogonal to each

268
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:37,380
other

269
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:39,849
we won't get into the crazy but but

270
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:42,189
getting the signal out of this out of

271
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:44,439
this time frequency lattice use for you

272
00:10:42,189 --> 00:10:46,029
for three a fast transforms pops the

273
00:10:44,439 --> 00:10:47,949
signal out you're able to decode bits

274
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:53,199
out of a signal essentially what you're

275
00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:55,870
trying to do so when you're jamming LTE

276
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:57,729
so this is this is an actual sorry about

277
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:59,769
this is probably small but this is what

278
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:03,970
it actually looks like and see the time

279
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:05,889
frequency domain so right away when your

280
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,210
phone's turning on it needs to listen to

281
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:08,920
this what's called the prime

282
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:12,310
synchronization signal and the secondary

283
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:16,630
signals a stream signal and that happens

284
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:18,040
here that's this initial burst of it and

285
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:19,660
then you see it happens here again and

286
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,120
this just repeats on and on and on

287
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:25,000
forever so it's constantly this constant

288
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,380
like here's my signal here's my signal

289
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,630
here's my signal measure it measure it

290
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,620
measure it and you're able to the U is

291
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,970
able to decode what's called the

292
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,550
physical cell ID out of those two

293
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:36,040
signals and once you know the physical

294
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:37,270
cell ID you can then decode this next

295
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,730
thing which is the cell specific

296
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:41,890
reference signal which are leased we're

297
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:43,570
called pilot channels so these are the

298
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:46,240
pilot channels are very important they

299
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:47,830
guide the ue back into the back into the

300
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:53,260
next stages so we can we can start

301
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:55,600
decoding the signal out of the air so to

302
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:59,140
jam it you'd you actually have to sniff

303
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:02,170
the PSS and SSS first and then you can

304
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:04,689
find out where in this see these white

305
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:06,069
bars you don't know where that where

306
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,750
those little red boxes are until you

307
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,920
decode those first and then you can know

308
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:13,030
okay that's where this is where the

309
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:14,920
pilots are Jam those and this keeps you

310
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:16,480
YZ from attaching to the network not

311
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,010
taking people off the network by keeping

312
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:23,020
you from attaching up onto the network

313
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:25,030
so that's first then there's what's

314
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:27,790
called a physical broadcast channel so

315
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:29,260
physical broadcast channel after you

316
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,939
after you decoded all this stuff you're

317
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:33,520
able to decode this this is on the very

318
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:37,780
front end here and it's repeated every L

319
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:39,760
every everything every beginning of the

320
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:43,930
subframe or beginning of the frames it's

321
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:45,819
repeated you Jam this guy and you keep

322
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,170
the you ease from decoding the master

323
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,820
information block and master information

324
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:50,880
block has this very very important like

325
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:53,410
timing information all stuff like that

326
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,200
that keeps the you east from camping

327
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:58,990
onto the network again but if you sniff

328
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:02,110
this master information block and start

329
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:04,540
decoding information from that then you

330
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:06,430
can actually open up more attacks so

331
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,420
you're starting to basically we're

332
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,069
building a smart camera now you're

333
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,260
starting to basically be like a ue

334
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,250
starting to attach and synchronize to

335
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,810
the network and starting to decode

336
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:16,150
information from the network that'll

337
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:19,660
expose the network's vulnerable the the

338
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:20,889
towers vulnerabilities so i pre we've

339
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,749
decoded the master information

340
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:24,399
block we can actually then decode these

341
00:13:22,749 --> 00:13:27,489
system information blocks which have

342
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:29,829
configuration information so identifying

343
00:13:27,489 --> 00:13:32,079
information about the tower we can we

344
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:35,529
can see who the tower owner is the

345
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:37,748
operator we can then also get these

346
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:40,449
parameters I you know be I Alzheimer's

347
00:13:37,749 --> 00:13:42,399
important the parameters to access the

348
00:13:40,449 --> 00:13:45,549
physical random access channel that's

349
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,470
the that's the channel that if you jam

350
00:13:45,549 --> 00:13:49,179
that you II can't attach as well but

351
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:51,359
then also you have paging channel if you

352
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:54,220
Jack if you can jam that paging channel

353
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:55,540
you can keep the UE stuck in our RC Idol

354
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,549
sorry I was talking about going from RC

355
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,719
Idol to our C connected you can't hear a

356
00:13:57,549 --> 00:14:00,850
paging channel the paging channel is

357
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:08,169
what wakes up the UE out of out of RC

358
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:10,629
Idol so yeah this one this one is kind

359
00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:12,189
of weird but basically this is an

360
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:14,769
example of an effect where if you jam

361
00:14:12,189 --> 00:14:17,980
this PC of this physical control format

362
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:20,829
indicator channel and you you stop the

363
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:23,649
you east from decoding this this control

364
00:14:20,829 --> 00:14:24,939
format indicator it breaks the next

365
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:27,189
channel so this is like we're having a

366
00:14:24,939 --> 00:14:32,829
cascade effect now so it's just a

367
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:35,259
example of that but so let's say we want

368
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:37,089
to jam the entire tower kick everybody

369
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:38,410
off the tower keep the like earlier

370
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:40,209
we're talking about kicking off target

371
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:42,399
you ease you can actually jam in the

372
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:44,219
uplink direction so damming the uplink

373
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,509
direction makes the tower not be able to

374
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:49,439
to see anything coming from all of its

375
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:51,759
servants all the people all the clients

376
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:54,389
so if you if you jam this a physical

377
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:56,889
uplink control channel there's this

378
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:57,759
uplink control info stuff that's very

379
00:14:56,889 --> 00:14:59,079
very important for the network to

380
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:00,939
constantly synchronize it's like you

381
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:02,290
know you're you're you east constantly

382
00:15:00,939 --> 00:15:04,089
going like oh I have this kind of

383
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:06,669
measurement to you I have this kind of

384
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:08,259
signal I'm moving in this direction this

385
00:15:06,669 --> 00:15:10,269
kind of stuff and that's constantly used

386
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:12,129
by the by the the cell tower to retune

387
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:14,860
and calibrate this stuff so if you jam

388
00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:19,839
that you actually Jam the entire tower

389
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:21,249
so and so that okay all the stuff is

390
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,600
source on this paper at the bottom and

391
00:15:21,249 --> 00:15:24,850
the end of this paper they have a

392
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,669
discussion about the cost of the

393
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:30,850
effectiveness of jamming you have this

394
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:33,639
uh I like this number here J over s so

395
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:34,000
what that is is basically jamming how

396
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:36,910
much

397
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,920
power you used over the signal received

398
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:40,390
at the receiver so if you're very very

399
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:43,930
inefficient you're using a lot of

400
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:45,420
jamming power and to get minimal signal

401
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:47,439
degradation on the on the endpoint

402
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,790
you're very very efficient you're using

403
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,070
if you're building a smart jammer you're

404
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:52,810
using very little jamming power to just

405
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:55,090
break everything

406
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:57,150
so we rate rank everything based on

407
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:59,530
efficiency and then also complexity

408
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,819
complexity is you know how much of a

409
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:02,520
smart chambered you have to be how many

410
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,780
- how many signals do you have to decode

411
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,770
to be able to jam this then it may come

412
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,000
it's more and more complex because

413
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:10,540
you're actually implementing you're

414
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,130
starting to implement a mini cellphone

415
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,890
it once you once you're really building

416
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:16,689
a smart amber you're basically building

417
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:19,240
a mini cellphone and that's it for

418
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:21,370
jamming so okay now we're moving on to

419
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,160
layer to the alter attack this was

420
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:27,190
disclosed I think in April by

421
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,020
researchers in Germany and it's kind of

422
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:32,170
a theoretical attack and in the regard

423
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:37,600
that you have to you have to intercept

424
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:41,500
and having a relay in between the UE and

425
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:44,110
the network so intercepting and holding

426
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:49,089
on to that is kind of difficult we'll

427
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:51,370
see why but for for to pull off this

428
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:53,530
attack you have to you have to have a

429
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:53,800
malicious relay you not a man in the

430
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,839
middle

431
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,329
technically what we're seeing on the

432
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,520
relay since the device earlier the

433
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:01,420
authentication key agreement we can't do

434
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,370
a man-in-the-middle because there's

435
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,020
mutual authentication so you're going to

436
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:07,000
fail you're gonna feel that crypto

437
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:08,740
challenge and all stuff but you can just

438
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,959
forward the traffic the encrypted

439
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:14,020
traffic to the actual network and just

440
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,130
act as a relay so we're not a full

441
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,869
man-in-the-middle that were a partial

442
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:19,839
now in the middle and then since your

443
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:21,729
encrypted traffic you have to we're

444
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:25,000
targeting DNS packets so you have to

445
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:27,490
deduce which what is that what traffic

446
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,010
is DNS packets and then you have to

447
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:32,110
alternate the DNS destination IP and

448
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:33,850
like a DNS redirection attack on an

449
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:35,679
encrypted packet so you don't know a

450
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:37,870
contents of it but you're able to reduce

451
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:41,380
what it is and also you know we're in it

452
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:45,310
where it is and and we'll see why why we

453
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:47,050
can we can do this so we're and this

454
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,800
part we're talking about the packet data

455
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,740
convergence

456
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:53,320
call what this does is actually

457
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:58,090
converges user plain data and control

458
00:17:53,320 --> 00:18:03,090
plain data to to the radio link control

459
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:05,740
and all these other lower layers the the

460
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:07,270
DNS actually DNS requests actually will

461
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:10,900
be going up to use your plain data up to

462
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:14,020
the IP layer so this is what handles the

463
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:18,250
the DNS requests it actually encrypts it

464
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:20,590
all that stuff and so okay and just a

465
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:22,390
I'm sure you guys are familiar with DNS

466
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:27,360
redirection so we have a destination IP

467
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:31,570
address we want to modify that and so

468
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:35,620
the packet here is actually encrypted in

469
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:37,750
AES counter mode which is not a it's a

470
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:39,790
es as you think of block block cipher

471
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:42,220
but a s in counter mode is actually a

472
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:46,690
stream cipher so since it's a stream

473
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:49,420
cipher where a the the were able the the

474
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:51,910
packet is malleable there's no integrity

475
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:53,650
protection there is a checksum we'll get

476
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:55,900
to that but there's no there's no

477
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:59,280
nothing stopping me from flipping a bit

478
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:01,720
in the message and changing the message

479
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:05,020
we need to manipulate this destination

480
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:07,330
IP address to target our malicious DNS

481
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:09,610
server and the you @ue will will

482
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:11,949
redirect I noted this really before the

483
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:14,469
talk but I if you use DNS SEC or TLS

484
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:19,930
this won't work because your your the

485
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:22,750
next layer is gonna okay anyway so so

486
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:24,880
there's just a we have the holding

487
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,380
they're holding this relay and actually

488
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,300
delivering the authentication key

489
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:30,970
agreement here is a theoretical thing

490
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:33,550
and not detailed here but if you did get

491
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:35,410
this which it is possible then you're

492
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:37,000
able to manipulate the DNS packing going

493
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:39,220
on going here and you have you mean they

494
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,540
play the destination IP to your your

495
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,340
malicious DNS server and then you have

496
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,990
it being relayed by the actual network

497
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,419
by the way this has to go through the

498
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:48,160
actual backhaul and then back to back to

499
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:50,800
the to the relay which then which then

500
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:53,590
the UE gets that the incorrect source IP

501
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,919
or the source IP to your malicious HTTP

502
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:59,110
server

503
00:19:53,920 --> 00:20:01,450
so notice HTTP you not HTTP anyway so

504
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,689
you have these DNS or you have these you

505
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,520
don't

506
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:05,670
if there are dns packets or not because

507
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,920
they're encrypted so how do you find out

508
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:11,920
well you can buy their length narrow it

509
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,300
down to about 96 percent and then you

510
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,220
can actually forward it to a DNS server

511
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:21,010
and if you get a DNS response than it is

512
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:23,380
a DNS packet and we're manipulating a

513
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:26,379
malleable cipher text so we don't need

514
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:28,390
to manipulate the whole thing just we

515
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:29,230
need to create this manipulation mask we

516
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:31,330
need to make believe just the

517
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:33,970
destination IP so if we can change the

518
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:36,010
view to the DNS redirection you have a

519
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:38,350
plaintext M and then you and then the

520
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:39,640
cipher text here this is what we got

521
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:41,379
we're manipulating a cipher text to

522
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,330
actually have a manipulated ciphertext C

523
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:45,790
Prime that will generate a minute

524
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:47,470
manipulated in plaintext M Prime how do

525
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:49,240
we find out the manipulation mask how do

526
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:51,190
we find out what bits and the keystream

527
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:56,200
are being applied to the original

528
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:58,030
destination IP to pop out the original

529
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,490
because we have the original ciphertext

530
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:02,260
C that's not that's it what we know

531
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:04,840
where the the IP is because it's it's a

532
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,850
certain offset and we know that phones

533
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,649
and all stuff have a default DNS server

534
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:10,750
you can find that out through other

535
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:14,620
analysis but let's just say is set to

536
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:16,750
Google 8.8.8.8 or whatever so you can

537
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,860
actually know what the original just for

538
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:23,940
the manipulation mask if you know what

539
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:27,399
the original data was there and then you

540
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:29,260
manipulate that to what you want the

541
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,600
target to be and you take this

542
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:33,220
manipulated plaint that the output you

543
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,860
take them away the plaintext any and you

544
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:38,110
bring it with the original plaintext use

545
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:40,659
orme together and out pops the keystream

546
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:42,790
writes or is an inverse of itself so

547
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:46,360
it's a it's a chosen cipher text attack

548
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:49,330
you can find out what bits in the key

549
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:52,350
stream are encrypting just that DNS

550
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:54,610
destination IP and then encrypt your

551
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:58,570
manipulated one to that knowing the

552
00:21:54,610 --> 00:22:00,129
knowing the bits so anyway so we've

553
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:03,639
manipulated this destination IP address

554
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:06,430
but we're now violating checksum because

555
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:09,340
we've changed the bits so let's say we

556
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:10,540
change the bits from 8.8.8.8 to quod

557
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,340
nine nine point nine point nine point

558
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:14,500
nine it's not a malicious dns but let's

559
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:17,220
just say we've just added four extra

560
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,220
bits right we had

561
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:21,710
you know eight in binary but now we have

562
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,389
nine so we have an extra bit so we just

563
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:25,159
got generated for extra base the

564
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:29,659
checksum in the IP header is gonna be

565
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:31,880
off it's gonna be off by by uh by those

566
00:22:29,659 --> 00:22:33,260
four extra bits so what you do is you

567
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,570
can you can manipulate any of these

568
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:37,370
other fields and the an IP header that

569
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:40,158
don't deal with routing or anything that

570
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:42,500
you would break a good candidate is the

571
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,929
TTL field so a time to live you know

572
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:47,690
number hops until we drop the packet you

573
00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:49,280
can manipulate the TTL field to get

574
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:52,760
those four bits back to not violate the

575
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:54,530
checksum same problem we don't know what

576
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,270
the TTL field is originally because it's

577
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:59,600
an encrypted packet well

578
00:22:56,270 --> 00:23:01,309
phones have a default TTL value you can

579
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,658
find that out too you know it's like you

580
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:06,710
know 500 or something like that

581
00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:08,750
and it also it helps that our relay is

582
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:11,990
only one hop away so we're not changing

583
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:14,929
it we can just anyway so the TTL field

584
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:17,240
is a good candidate to use what has to

585
00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:19,789
happen is that the manipulated IP

586
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:22,610
addresses and it's arted plus the

587
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:26,419
manipulated TTL field all has to pass

588
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:28,610
did not change the checksum so we need

589
00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:30,289
when you do that when you you know you

590
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:31,668
change this destination IP address and

591
00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:35,419
you check to make sure that checksum is

592
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:37,490
not violated you're you're successful in

593
00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:38,990
the in the regard that you hope that the

594
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,370
thing when it's being delivered by the

595
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:42,320
network actually gets there because

596
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:44,330
you've manipulated the TTL so the TTL

597
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,100
actually can be decremented to make this

598
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:47,809
this math work out here on the bottom

599
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:51,969
and then your your thing won't actually

600
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:55,299
get there but if it does it works and

601
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:56,450
they were saying that they were like 94%

602
00:23:55,299 --> 00:23:59,480
effective

603
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:01,490
so they actually showed it to be

604
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:05,390
feasible with it with a test harness and

605
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:08,330
all that stuff so yeah you just have to

606
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:12,380
make sure that the everything sums up

607
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:17,030
correctly and it works so anyway moving

608
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:20,780
on a layer 3 so this is more or I mat so

609
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:23,559
our RC & nass are these radio resource

610
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:25,730
control and non access strata messages

611
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:28,220
like I said you're able to send these to

612
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:29,360
the you II before authentication so

613
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:32,000
these are these are message

614
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:35,479
just that you can send and actually

615
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,940
control Yui behavior so I already talked

616
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,799
about why is this why is this possible

617
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:41,240
well because of the nature of an

618
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:43,879
over-the-air protocol because the way

619
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:47,630
they specify the 3gpp specified protocol

620
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:50,420
that they needed they needed basic

621
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:51,760
interoperability primarily and security

622
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:54,740
later

623
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:57,920
so in also yeah I have to note so I've

624
00:24:54,740 --> 00:25:00,380
been reading the 5g security spec and

625
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:02,450
it's slowly trickling out they are

626
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:04,400
narrowing this attack space so they

627
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:06,919
realize that there's a problem here and

628
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:10,070
they're there they're moving up

629
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:11,660
authentication and you you can't be

630
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:13,850
issuing these kind of messages without

631
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:20,780
being authenticated first and 5g so very

632
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:25,219
very good that that is being so how do

633
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:28,730
we how do we trigger so the UE your your

634
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:30,950
device is constantly like constantly

635
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:34,190
like evaluating other cell towers and

636
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:37,130
trying to find the best signal and so

637
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:39,230
you're the kind of example is I would

638
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:40,850
say is you know in Wi-Fi you have like

639
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,080
your home network you attach to it and

640
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:44,000
you choose that and you choose every you

641
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,520
know you I want to connect to Starbucks

642
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,919
open Wi-Fi I want that to this you user

643
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,660
has control over Wi-Fi on cellular they

644
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:52,910
don't so that the device is constantly

645
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:55,610
reattaching to other networks by on its

646
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:57,799
own and you don't have any visibility to

647
00:25:55,610 --> 00:26:00,530
it Android doesn't draw anything I phone

648
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:03,168
even less it doesn't tell you other than

649
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:05,720
like you're on AT&T network and you have

650
00:26:03,169 --> 00:26:11,150
four bars that's all that's exposed to

651
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:13,540
API is really I mean so your ear UE is

652
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:15,890
constantly switching to other towers and

653
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:17,510
occasionally it's actually turning off

654
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:18,950
encryption and rebuilding encryption

655
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:20,450
when it's switching sometimes that has

656
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:22,910
to happen so it be like your Wi-Fi is

657
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:25,429
got a little padlock padlocks going on

658
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:26,990
and off like turning on and off and and

659
00:26:25,429 --> 00:26:29,000
and you're like why is that happening

660
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:30,320
well cellular it happens and it's all

661
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,990
behind the curtain you don't know about

662
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,418
it but it's constantly uh it's

663
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:37,010
constantly a thing so where as an

664
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:41,270
attacker we're able to intercept you

665
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:42,379
because of the this for a very moment

666
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:45,860
forgets to talk about this

667
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:47,360
attack window so how do you do that the

668
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:49,699
simplest and the easiest way is to

669
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,139
transmit at higher power so you come you

670
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,090
come in with a tower that's like hey

671
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:54,410
guys I got amazing signal everybody come

672
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:56,810
to me and all that all the devices will

673
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:58,040
go old thing is if the device is happy

674
00:26:56,810 --> 00:27:01,310
where it's at if you got four bars where

675
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:03,560
it's at it's not gonna reselect you can

676
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:05,060
broadcast as your tower under the system

677
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,710
information block so it's talking about

678
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:09,760
earlier you can broadcast as your your

679
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:13,010
tower you could say my tower is 18 T and

680
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,840
Verizon and Sprint and t-mobile like all

681
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:18,170
all in the u.s. they're you know four

682
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:21,320
big operators you can actually broadcast

683
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:23,990
as your being a multiple operator of

684
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:25,970
cell tower and your device wants to

685
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:29,240
attach to the network that's its home

686
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:30,800
network so if you're moving on to your

687
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,030
roaming if you're going to like say

688
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,190
you're going to another country and

689
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:36,080
you're roaming on to other networks the

690
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:37,010
device actually struggles it goes I

691
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,149
don't want to go to any of these other

692
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:40,100
networks I want to look for my home

693
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:41,420
network first and it eventually gives up

694
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:43,790
and again it attaches to the busy

695
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:45,590
networks so if you're broadcasting as

696
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:48,230
the device is home network your your

697
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:49,639
even your even better there's also this

698
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:51,800
thing called tracking area code and

699
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:54,050
tracking area update so if you remember

700
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:56,659
the mobility management entity that part

701
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:59,840
of the backhaul that constantly is

702
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:02,000
handling the the knows where the where

703
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,470
you are and geographically and as you're

704
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,610
moving around to other areas so as

705
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:06,440
you're moving around to other cell

706
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:09,010
towers the networks constantly doing

707
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,790
this process called tracking area update

708
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:11,810
once the tracking your update is

709
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:14,990
completed you're giving this tracking

710
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:16,700
area code if you broadcast at any other

711
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:18,080
tracking area code that's other than the

712
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,820
tracking area code in the certain area

713
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,280
let's say our tracking area code is 1 2

714
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:25,370
3 4 and I just broadcast a tower with

715
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:27,139
the tracking area code for 4 4 4 or a

716
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,520
different tracking area code all your

717
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,500
uese are all gonna think that they're

718
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,730
moving into this different area and

719
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,020
they're gonna start communicating your

720
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:35,570
tower talk start trying to do this

721
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:36,830
tracking area update procedure so this

722
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:38,149
actually is way easier than the first

723
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:39,980
two bullet points so you can just do

724
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:42,470
this and it works the you eezol switch

725
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:43,610
to your tower going oh I need to do

726
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:46,220
tracking area okay because I'm moving

727
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:48,530
into a new area and that's how you get

728
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:50,630
them you can also configure attractive

729
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:52,220
reflection parameters so there's this

730
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:53,729
constant load balancing parameters at

731
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:55,649
the network's do the

732
00:28:53,729 --> 00:28:56,579
there was this backhoe that networks

733
00:28:55,649 --> 00:28:58,199
actually really cool it's a self

734
00:28:56,579 --> 00:29:00,178
optimizing network this song they use

735
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,589
the easiest thing so when one cell tower

736
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:03,749
is being overloaded and other cell

737
00:29:01,589 --> 00:29:05,579
towers parameters will become more

738
00:29:03,749 --> 00:29:08,190
attractive so the device is load

739
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:09,869
balancing salsas kind of cool well you

740
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:11,399
can just maximize all those parameters

741
00:29:09,869 --> 00:29:13,589
and make your make your tower even more

742
00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:15,689
attractive then likewise once you've

743
00:29:13,589 --> 00:29:16,859
attracted somebody to attach to you you

744
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:18,359
can do these techniques called cell

745
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:21,658
imprisonment where you make it hard for

746
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:23,129
the device to escape from you so cell

747
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:24,869
towers always broadcast their neighbors

748
00:29:23,129 --> 00:29:26,070
they go this these these are the

749
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:27,208
neighbors and these are the different

750
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:28,529
frequencies that are available these are

751
00:29:27,209 --> 00:29:29,789
the different areas that your device can

752
00:29:28,529 --> 00:29:31,799
reselect too they get they always give

753
00:29:29,789 --> 00:29:33,719
you a way out they always give you like

754
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:37,259
like if you attach to me but you're

755
00:29:33,719 --> 00:29:38,909
moving that way you know if you're an

756
00:29:37,259 --> 00:29:40,409
attacker you just say I don't have any

757
00:29:38,909 --> 00:29:42,479
neighbors there's no there's no towers

758
00:29:40,409 --> 00:29:45,889
here I'm the only guy sorry

759
00:29:42,479 --> 00:29:48,089
stay on me that's still imprisonment

760
00:29:45,889 --> 00:29:49,468
likewise you could Jam other towers what

761
00:29:48,089 --> 00:29:51,450
I was talking about earlier so if the UE

762
00:29:49,469 --> 00:29:54,209
is happy on its tower you can jam it and

763
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:55,889
it'll just release select yours the more

764
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:57,269
sophisticated so the stingrays and the

765
00:29:55,889 --> 00:29:59,309
stuff I was saying about they were more

766
00:29:57,269 --> 00:30:01,559
expensive they are combinations of

767
00:29:59,309 --> 00:30:03,809
jammers and fake towers so they Jam all

768
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:09,029
the other bands and they keep their bear

769
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:10,469
band open it's a you know it's more

770
00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:12,539
sophisticated attack what you can you

771
00:30:10,469 --> 00:30:13,649
can you can combine all these attacks to

772
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:15,149
make you more effective more effective

773
00:30:13,649 --> 00:30:16,829
then lastly we're going to talk about

774
00:30:15,149 --> 00:30:20,549
channel hijacking this is a theoretical

775
00:30:16,829 --> 00:30:22,408
thing that's pretty new research and

776
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:25,408
we'll talk about that in a second

777
00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:25,679
so what I just talked about that last

778
00:30:25,409 --> 00:30:27,059
slide

779
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,919
it's just triggering Reis election how

780
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:31,649
do you trigger the UE to start talking

781
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:33,629
to your tower here they always attach to

782
00:30:31,649 --> 00:30:35,008
the real network and from whatever how

783
00:30:33,629 --> 00:30:36,389
we did it from this previous slide we've

784
00:30:35,009 --> 00:30:37,950
triggered a resolution probably the

785
00:30:36,389 --> 00:30:40,498
tracking area code different or whatever

786
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:42,329
so the and this is actually in a

787
00:30:40,499 --> 00:30:44,070
scenario that the UE is thinking that

788
00:30:42,329 --> 00:30:45,359
it's performing tracking area updates so

789
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:48,539
it's saying track the area update

790
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:49,918
request and we all this is super simple

791
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:52,169
all we have to do is reject with

792
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,909
specific cost code so the cost code is

793
00:30:52,169 --> 00:30:55,979
in this case I think is causing nine all

794
00:30:53,909 --> 00:30:58,739
it does is says you we cannot be

795
00:30:55,979 --> 00:31:00,899
identified by network per protocol

796
00:30:58,739 --> 00:31:03,299
through per 3gpp protocol that Yui then

797
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:06,779
sends attach request with its MZ so it

798
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:07,379
just getting the getting the victims MZ

799
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:10,770
the subscribe

800
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:12,810
identifier is trivially easy when people

801
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:14,100
are like oh these MC catchers all these

802
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:15,389
sophisticated things it's not they're

803
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,699
not sophisticated they're just simple

804
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:18,540
they go track of your update reject

805
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,640
cause nine

806
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:23,250
give me your identifier and then per

807
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,260
protocol that Yui follows that then they

808
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:27,720
just simply just benignly reject you

809
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:29,610
they go up and they've captured your MZ

810
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,590
so this is an example like a

811
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:36,719
surveillance device simple no no like

812
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:40,889
attack here just a privacy leak we can

813
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:45,030
actually deal it more nasty here so same

814
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:46,860
call flow and the MZ is leaked again you

815
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:48,480
know what nothing you know nothing stops

816
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:50,280
you from also getting the MZ on this

817
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,870
attack as well but then we send this

818
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,550
special attach reject at the end we

819
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:55,590
don't do it benign at at reject like the

820
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:57,810
the previous example we do an attach

821
00:31:55,590 --> 00:32:00,000
reject that says EPS and on EPS services

822
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:01,950
are not allowed that means for G and non

823
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,010
4G services are not allowed that means

824
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:07,310
your phone's modem starts a timer like a

825
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:09,600
10 minute timer and turns itself off and

826
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:11,580
essentially you've just tricked the the

827
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,070
modem into down to its own denial

828
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:16,199
service the only way to get out of it

829
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:20,520
without waiting for the timer to expire

830
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:22,080
is the power cycle of the device so now

831
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,570
the modem turns off so airplane mode

832
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:35,100
turns off the modem but a modem goes to

833
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:37,439
a low power mode and yeah if your phone

834
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,969
is Sims hot swappable some phones the

835
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,500
sim is not hot swappable you have to

836
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:43,980
reboot when you put the sim in but if it

837
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:45,540
is this the sim can get loaded then you

838
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:49,860
you just pop this in back in and out and

839
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:53,730
I think the the since the sim is being

840
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:55,770
read it'll turn the modem back on and

841
00:32:53,730 --> 00:33:00,330
like I said it's a 10-minute dose it's

842
00:32:55,770 --> 00:33:01,710
it's super easy to do this one just like

843
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:04,169
the previous example because this is

844
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:06,240
happening in the protocol there it's not

845
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:07,650
like if you were doing a jamming dose or

846
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:12,090
a lot of stuff you'd have to get more

847
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:14,370
sophisticated but the the modem turns

848
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:16,409
off it it starts this teeth for three

849
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:18,750
one two timer or something like that per

850
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:20,370
protocol perspect yeah one thing I

851
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,270
forgot to mention all these messages all

852
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:22,409
these things ever send

853
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:24,480
these layer and layer two layer three

854
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:25,980
attacks are all valid per protocol

855
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,540
we're not we're not like doing any like

856
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:29,040
remote code execution or any like

857
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:31,320
exploits here we're just sending a

858
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:34,170
malicious certain licious sequence of

859
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:36,000
messages and we're controlling Yui

860
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:37,500
behavior like I was talking about

861
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,650
earlier this message coming down for the

862
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:42,000
network turns your modem off they can go

863
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:44,220
they the network can go turn your modem

864
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,680
off remotely and they're not your modem

865
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,810
goes okay I'm following protocol I'm

866
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:53,810
following the rules so now we get a bit

867
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:53,810
more nasty we could do a downgrade so

868
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:58,650
like I said for G he's actually secure

869
00:33:56,250 --> 00:34:00,030
for G has mutual authentication once

870
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:01,890
mutual once the authentication key

871
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:05,040
agreement is passed and all stuff we're

872
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:06,210
good TG does it 2g has one way

873
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,370
authentication the network

874
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:13,918
authenticating the UE and they even then

875
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:16,620
that's optional and then two G has Nolan

876
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:19,168
Krypton support so you can not have

877
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:21,270
encryption or it even has weak like

878
00:34:19,168 --> 00:34:23,399
certain to GE Krypton algorithms or weak

879
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:25,560
there's there from the like Cold War era

880
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:27,899
or like like we didn't want to give the

881
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,279
thermal country strong encryption so one

882
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:32,069
was like global as an encryption scheme

883
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,419
that was for export and the other ones

884
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,760
were actually used internally in the

885
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:37,139
u.s. in the UK and all the stuff so

886
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,380
there's actually there's actually like

887
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:42,870
ete a1 and ee8 I forget are actually

888
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:44,970
weak encryption and at Def Con I wish I

889
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:47,969
had brought my I wish I had brought the

890
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:50,009
kids at the data sharing village or

891
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:52,259
whatever they were if he brought like a

892
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:54,510
six terabyte drive they had the the GSM

893
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:56,220
rainbow tables for the for the weak

894
00:34:54,510 --> 00:35:00,840
encryption so I was like I wish I had I

895
00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:02,609
wish I brought that yeah so anyway um so

896
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,350
when you have no one to no integrity or

897
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:08,580
no authentication and no encryption what

898
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:12,660
do you have a man in the middle like on

899
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:14,100
cellular so this is bad

900
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:16,049
one thing to note here is that this

901
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:20,279
downgrade actually so this downgrade is

902
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:22,380
not the best in the I think is that it

903
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,450
says actually EPS service is not allowed

904
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:26,160
which means 40s out loud so technically

905
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:28,470
the modem as a way out that they can go

906
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,629
to 3G and then 3G service is there

907
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:32,850
the modal actually will attach the 3G so

908
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:35,040
I don't I don't think this is actually a

909
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:38,819
feasible downgrade in most cases because

910
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:41,040
of 2g here in the US to G is deployed as

911
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:43,230
a backhaul there's only there's no like

912
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,100
2g towers broadcasting as in like you

913
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:45,960
can attach to me

914
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,220
2g towers are still here and they're

915
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:51,690
using what's called circuits which fall

916
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:54,899
back so LT is a packet only so LTE

917
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:56,340
doesn't have lt's packets which doesn't

918
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:59,160
have circuits which circuits which is

919
00:35:56,340 --> 00:36:04,370
the old you know patching cables like

920
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:06,870
hello hello you know pts PSTN correct so

921
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:09,240
when we are making a phone call and

922
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:10,799
voiceover LT is not available we have to

923
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:13,500
downgrade which is called circuits which

924
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,000
fall back to either 3G or 2g so 2g is

925
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:18,540
still deployed here in the u.s. even

926
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,070
though it's not it's not being

927
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,960
broadcasted like if I'm like sweeping

928
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:23,790
around I can't find 2g towers I can find

929
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,290
3G and 4G towers they're not they're not

930
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:27,270
broadcasting their existence but they're

931
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:28,980
still there as far apart the backhaul so

932
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:32,370
your modems will support 2g for a long

933
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:34,080
time getting ahead of myself but yeah so

934
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:37,890
people are like well to geez not there

935
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:40,500
why why is 2g downgrade so possible so

936
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:42,509
ok this down right here actually may

937
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,870
allow you to just like to 3G it's not as

938
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:46,500
good

939
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:48,690
this downgrade though so after our SC

940
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:51,030
connector set up an RC connection setup

941
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:52,620
is complete we can actually send this

942
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:55,080
message at any time but in this example

943
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:57,600
we leaked the MC first and then we sent

944
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:59,759
this message but you can send this RC

945
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:02,460
connection release and say redirected

946
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:05,070
carrier info so what that and specifying

947
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:07,740
G ran specifying the GSM radio network

948
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:10,890
and that what that does is forcibly

949
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:12,540
switch your modem it says redirect to

950
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:14,580
this radio technology redirect A to G

951
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:16,259
and even listen to this frequency so

952
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:21,660
it's really specific it tells that

953
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:25,680
you'ii go straight there and then you

954
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:26,029
have the no encryption and also bad very

955
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:31,020
bad

956
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:34,290
why is this possible so and redirection

957
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:36,300
is a very important thing for 3gpp when

958
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:37,920
that people designed this protocol they

959
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,960
always wanted to have this redirection

960
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,240
capability and it has to be as

961
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:45,120
lightweight as possible because in like

962
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:48,689
an emergency situation say there's a you

963
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:49,920
know a big catastrophic emergency

964
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:52,260
and everybody's trying to use the

965
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,940
cellular network at once and the okay

966
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:57,540
also the cellular network is also the

967
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:59,310
primary emergency communication system -

968
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:00,750
so all the emergency infrastructure all

969
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:05,190
relies on the cellular network and if

970
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:07,770
you if you have an emergency situation

971
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:10,109
there has to be emergency services

972
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:11,910
available there's like the primary thing

973
00:38:10,109 --> 00:38:13,380
and we're not caring about security or

974
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:15,720
anything like that we're caring about

975
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:17,400
load balancing and interoperability here

976
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,980
so the and when they were doing that

977
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,660
protocol spec there they were like in a

978
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:24,150
case where one towers being overloaded

979
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:26,069
in an emergency situation they're

980
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:28,230
allowed to redirect to other towers and

981
00:38:26,069 --> 00:38:30,779
other radios to low balance and to

982
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:33,589
spread to spread the the service around

983
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:37,500
to other other parts of the network

984
00:38:33,589 --> 00:38:39,240
that's their justification that being

985
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:43,079
said we have to deal with the mess it's

986
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:45,029
very bad the the the unauthenticated

987
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:48,599
message coming down to you saying

988
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:51,150
switch your modem to 2g and unless your

989
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:54,300
modem had some sort of countermeasure in

990
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:56,760
it they will they will switch the 2g on

991
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:59,930
this particular band even so you don't

992
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:02,190
even have to do any trickery about

993
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:04,109
having the motive switch to 2g and then

994
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:06,630
having your tower there with like select

995
00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:08,759
Reese elective like highly attractive

996
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:10,650
tower you just say go to the 2g band

997
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:12,510
that the tower is already there so you

998
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:15,210
have you have to you have a like in my

999
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:18,349
lab I have a an LTE tower downgrade you

1000
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:21,540
to a 2g tower and it works

1001
00:39:18,349 --> 00:39:24,060
so okay this is a example for something

1002
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:26,220
from my lab once your downgrade to 2g

1003
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:30,509
it's actually really simple to do

1004
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:31,799
fake SMS you have a you have a full

1005
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:33,750
man-in-the-middle so you can do any more

1006
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,599
malicious stuff you could do fake

1007
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:38,790
emergency messages so this is that

1008
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:41,579
emergency broadcast system or the CBS

1009
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:43,650
cell broadcast system and 2g and that

1010
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:45,450
and that's like you know Amber Alert so

1011
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:47,310
even if your phones on silent phone will

1012
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:49,919
wake up in go brain barrier and draw

1013
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:52,440
this draw this toast notification and

1014
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,880
just yeah it was funny when I do in my

1015
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,290
lab I have like I have like a multiple

1016
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:58,349
bunch of devices they all go off at once

1017
00:39:55,290 --> 00:40:01,140
it's like it's like we called the panic

1018
00:39:58,349 --> 00:40:02,160
attack so if a camera see messages and

1019
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,960
it's

1020
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,759
in here but you can actually put URLs in

1021
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:08,330
there and it'll draw as a clickable URL

1022
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:11,820
so you put phishing links in there and

1023
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:14,610
you can do fake SMS so in China there's

1024
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:17,100
a there's this rise of criminals using a

1025
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:18,180
cheap software-defined radio all this

1026
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:20,339
tricks I was telling you about

1027
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:21,569
they they they trick you onto the down

1028
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:23,760
accrete onto the 2g network and then

1029
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:28,200
they serve what serve you up fake SMS so

1030
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:31,140
I serve you up phishing SMS and the the

1031
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:34,589
paper I read it was like for about 1500

1032
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:35,940
bucks of initial equipment purchase and

1033
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:37,350
then some technical know-how you can be

1034
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:39,360
started you could you can make your

1035
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:43,069
money back within like a couple days and

1036
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:45,600
so it's pretty lucrative thing in China

1037
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:47,550
another thing in China is a they have

1038
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:49,500
were called authoritative number so the

1039
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:52,080
bank the government like certain

1040
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:53,760
entities have a phone number in China if

1041
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:56,100
you're delivering a fake SMS you can

1042
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,540
spoof I can send an SMS from 9-1-1

1043
00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:00,960
that's an example of an authoritative

1044
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:02,670
number here right so you can say you

1045
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,620
know the Bank of America Bank of China

1046
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:06,870
is telling you that you have suspicious

1047
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:09,029
activity on your account please click

1048
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:11,430
here to go to account recovery you know

1049
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:12,210
and then they have some phishing site or

1050
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:15,390
something like that

1051
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:18,030
so people don't get tricked by phishing

1052
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:20,069
emails as much anymore but phishing SMS

1053
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:22,110
and phishing emergency messages have

1054
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:25,260
like a little bit more authority to them

1055
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:27,630
so it works the people who like a text

1056
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:29,670
message I have to click on this but

1057
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:32,460
anyway the last thing we're going to

1058
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:33,810
talk about is a channel hijacking so I

1059
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:37,130
said this was more of a theoretical

1060
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:41,190
thing this is brand-new research that

1061
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:42,900
the University of Iowa and Purdue came

1062
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:44,790
out with and it's really cool we're only

1063
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:50,640
going to talk about what particularly

1064
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:53,070
part of it but so this slide is about

1065
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:55,290
the the tax procedure that we've already

1066
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:57,390
gone over and then once you're attached

1067
00:41:55,290 --> 00:42:01,050
to the network the modem actually wants

1068
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:02,759
to go into idle state and it has what's

1069
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:04,830
called this paging cycle so it sleeps

1070
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:07,260
and it wakes up on this paging cycle and

1071
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:11,040
it listens to the paging occasion on the

1072
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:13,800
paging channel sorry anyway

1073
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:15,600
paging means that so I sent something to

1074
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,980
your phone and that that you know

1075
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,960
semesters coming over the network to

1076
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:21,000
your phone and your phone sleeping it

1077
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,830
wakes up that one time to hear the

1078
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,630
paging channel and the network it right

1079
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:26,580
at the same time to synchronize the

1080
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:28,590
right Africa goes page for you I have a

1081
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:30,990
message for you wake up then the you the

1082
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:33,180
the device moves from RC Idol onto RC

1083
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:34,410
connected and then we actually deliver

1084
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:38,669
the actual thing

1085
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:40,230
so paging channel is very important if

1086
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:42,150
we were jamming it earlier like I said

1087
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:43,860
we are tossing all the devices that are

1088
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:45,780
listening the paging channel but in this

1089
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:47,580
case we're going to inject traffic into

1090
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:49,950
the paging channel so what's cool about

1091
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:51,660
this attack is that it's a possible to

1092
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:53,669
attribute or who's who's doing the

1093
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:55,770
attack your masquerading as a legitimate

1094
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:57,060
tower and you're like all the other

1095
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:59,610
attacks I'll talk about earlier you have

1096
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:00,840
like the other actual legitimate towers

1097
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,860
and you have your fake cell tower and

1098
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,300
you're trying to trick people to attach

1099
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,780
to your fake cell tower to launch these

1100
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,580
attacks

1101
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:08,070
here you're injecting traffic into the

1102
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:10,910
actual legitimate cell tower so it's

1103
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:10,910
kind of it's kind of cool

1104
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:14,970
so paging messages that come in the

1105
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:15,600
downlink they don't have any kind of

1106
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:18,089
encryption

1107
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,770
they can't paging messages are purely

1108
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:23,910
like networks saying you have something

1109
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:27,480
wake up and get it so what you do is you

1110
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:30,359
you you actually have to to configure

1111
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:32,100
your tower to to look like the exact

1112
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:34,560
paging channel of the other Tower you

1113
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:36,630
have to actually like sniff these system

1114
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,799
information blocks these two and then

1115
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:39,720
you can figure your tower to have the

1116
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,160
exact same paging cycle remember the

1117
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:43,589
device waking up on that page a cycle

1118
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:47,640
well now now you're paging cycles on the

1119
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:50,580
same thing the UE only responds to the

1120
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:51,720
first receive message it's actually

1121
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:53,549
interesting when I do this when I do

1122
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:56,790
this attack is that there's a there's a

1123
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:57,960
there's a case where the the UE stamped

1124
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:59,580
on the network and the network is

1125
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,870
delivering these pages with this much

1126
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:02,190
signal when you're when you're injecting

1127
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:04,500
your traffic your traffic is actually

1128
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:06,450
interference at the beginning so your

1129
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:08,310
modem just goes ignores it and then

1130
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:09,779
eventually your your signal will will

1131
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:11,130
beat out the actual legitimate network

1132
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,480
and then there's like actually a

1133
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:14,250
confused period where we're not getting

1134
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,140
any signal if you're not careful you'll

1135
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:18,720
get radio link failure but then then on

1136
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:20,100
the other side your signal becomes the

1137
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,319
signal and the network signal becomes

1138
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:24,120
noise so you actually are doing a dose

1139
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:26,580
in this as well if you are if you're

1140
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:28,569
hijacking the paging channel the device

1141
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:33,220
can't hear pages from the

1142
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:36,910
Network anymore - last Bowl I just

1143
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:37,779
basically said that so anyway so there's

1144
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:39,370
three different things you could do with

1145
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:40,330
this like I said if you just paid if

1146
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:42,100
you're hijacking the paging channel

1147
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:44,680
you've just kicked the person off the

1148
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:46,060
network stealthily they don't have no

1149
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,319
idea that they can't because they can't

1150
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:49,779
hear pages they'd have no idea they're

1151
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:52,000
completely oblivious you can actually do

1152
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:53,230
the panic attack so this is in 4G so the

1153
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,180
other panic attack I showed you earlier

1154
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:57,430
was a downgrade to 2g you can actually

1155
00:44:55,180 --> 00:45:00,520
deliver fake emergency messages in 4G

1156
00:44:57,430 --> 00:45:02,440
you send a page you have the emergency

1157
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:05,650
bit flipped like this like in the page

1158
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:08,260
that goes I have a burn C message for

1159
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:11,740
you the device wakes up and it listens

1160
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:13,660
to sip 10 11 or 12 and in there are the

1161
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:15,629
emergency messages themselves so without

1162
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:18,250
any authentication without any kind of

1163
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:21,100
connection to the network the device

1164
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:23,470
here's that bit goes and decodes your

1165
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:24,310
your mercy message and then draws it on

1166
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:25,870
the thing

1167
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:27,460
like I said emergency messages have to

1168
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:29,140
be very lightweight they don't have any

1169
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:30,670
kind of authentication this is like an

1170
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:32,259
emergency situation like explain earlier

1171
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:34,210
than that this network has to broadcast

1172
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:35,770
those things when the tornado is coming

1173
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:39,100
or when the earthquake the tsunami is

1174
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:40,780
coming or whatever and then the last the

1175
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:43,390
last one is an energy depletion attack

1176
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:45,970
this one is not so bad for your mobile

1177
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:48,520
phone but it's devastating for IOT you

1178
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:50,080
just continuously page the victim over

1179
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:52,360
and over and over again so you make them

1180
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,230
wake up try to attach the network and if

1181
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,120
you can get them to do the

1182
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:56,410
authentication key agreement every time

1183
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:59,850
actually you're making them do some

1184
00:45:56,410 --> 00:46:03,279
cryptographic math on that processor so

1185
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:06,220
you just you just continuously page over

1186
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:09,580
and over and over again and you perform

1187
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:12,640
that battery change the actual

1188
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:14,500
effectiveness it probably is like you

1189
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,089
know an IOT battery it should last like

1190
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:18,850
ten years now you're killing it in a

1191
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:20,950
couple days I think depends depends

1192
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:23,440
depends on the DRX cycle other things

1193
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:25,450
but anyway so that's pretty much it so

1194
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:29,440
there's a little conclusion here and

1195
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:31,029
then we're done so barrier to entry is

1196
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,980
dropping rapidly I told you I told you

1197
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:38,050
guys about how cheap software-defined

1198
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:39,100
radios are getting and LTE it's got to

1199
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:40,780
be around for a long time I know

1200
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,670
everyone's like oh oh five g's coming up

1201
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:45,890
soon

1202
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:45,890
LT is gonna be around for a long time

1203
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:49,890
yeah

1204
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:53,549
GSM is around so like I was saying

1205
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:55,140
earlier and okay in my lab I use I use a

1206
00:46:53,549 --> 00:46:59,099
software-defined radio and open source

1207
00:46:55,140 --> 00:47:02,720
software so open LT is alright SRS LT is

1208
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:04,650
a little bit more mature you can't just

1209
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,970
you can't just like how these things

1210
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:07,619
work out of the box you actually have to

1211
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:12,328
configure them to work maliciously but

1212
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:16,559
once you do you're ready to go and then

1213
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:18,780
lastly I have to have the the LTE tower

1214
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:21,180
downgrade you to the 2g tower to run the

1215
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:24,119
2g tower use open BTS and open BTS is

1216
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:26,220
actually very mature gsm is older so the

1217
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:27,599
open source software for the older older

1218
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:29,669
stuff is like been around for a long

1219
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:31,530
time so open BTS is actually really cool

1220
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:32,790
if you have a software-defined radio it

1221
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:34,619
doesn't have to be the ones that support

1222
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:37,230
out the LTE bands but an older one is

1223
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:39,750
that just has a duplex

1224
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:42,480
you can run open BTS and that's your own

1225
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:43,589
mini 2g network so like at Burning Man

1226
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,910
they like had a bunch of the

1227
00:47:43,589 --> 00:47:46,710
software-defined radios and they and

1228
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:51,750
they set up their own little mini GSM

1229
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:58,770
network so broadcasting unlicensed

1230
00:47:51,750 --> 00:48:00,900
spectrum is illegal yeah there is what's

1231
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:02,970
called broadcasting on the test band and

1232
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:07,530
broadcasting as the tests operator test

1233
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:09,029
P lemon so P lemon is the is the code of

1234
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:14,130
the mobile country code and mobile

1235
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:16,500
network code so 18 T is 3 104 one o you

1236
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:19,950
broadcast is as a zero zero one zero one

1237
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:22,230
you're technically the test P lemon and

1238
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:24,240
you have to have SIM cards and have the

1239
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:26,099
that that operator in them for that

1240
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:28,649
weather device I think that that it's

1241
00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:30,180
it's home network otherwise it'll I

1242
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:33,480
don't think it's roaming onto that and

1243
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:40,649
then use the test ban which i think is

1244
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:41,880
band two which is 900 so question is is

1245
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:44,730
it legal if you're in the middle of

1246
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:46,710
nowhere I think I'm not sure if anybody

1247
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:52,049
cares but yeah you're technically

1248
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:56,270
broadcasting on licensed spectrum so use

1249
00:48:52,049 --> 00:48:56,270
your own discretion but yeah at home

1250
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:08,040
yeah so for LTE LTE has to be on USB 3.0

1251
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:13,230
and one that when you're flashing the

1252
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:16,620
the like open LTE or all stuff it so I

1253
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:19,560
use a UHD USRP hardware driver it checks

1254
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:21,569
it does clock tests and at the 10th if

1255
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:24,120
the clocks speed is incorrect at all

1256
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:27,210
then then it won't work so LT LT

1257
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:29,759
actually needs to it needs to decode the

1258
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:31,560
signal and do all this all this digital

1259
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,600
signal processing to demodulate the

1260
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:36,120
signal out of it into its bits and needs

1261
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:39,120
to do that very very rapidly over over

1262
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:44,460
like over very small like I was talking

1263
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:47,370
about Roberto FDM so LTE you you can't

1264
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:49,920
you do LTE on any kind of cheap SDR the

1265
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:51,450
ones down here all support it so the B

1266
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:57,680
to ten that's the one I use that one's

1267
00:49:51,450 --> 00:50:00,419
about a thousand bucks the hack RF and

1268
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:02,250
blade RF so when I was at Def Con they

1269
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:05,040
just came out with this new one it's

1270
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:12,780
four hundred bucks and it's a pitch goes

1271
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:15,240
up to 6 gigahertz and it's smaller the

1272
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:19,140
USRP board at its research they have the

1273
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:20,970
have use pretty mature software to load

1274
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:23,250
load like these things are filled

1275
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:27,689
program field programmable gate array or

1276
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:30,450
FGP anywhere fpga so they they need very

1277
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:34,770
good software to load the to flash the

1278
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:39,870
that stuff and so the b210 i recommend

1279
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:42,210
but it's also the most expensive gps oh

1280
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:44,370
no don't need it those are external

1281
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:45,480
modules that you can load but they don't

1282
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:47,609
need to work they don't need me there

1283
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:49,830
for the for any other stuff to to work

1284
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:51,450
actually if you want to do that kind of

1285
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:52,860
stuff you need them all you need the

1286
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:56,700
physical module and you need the the

1287
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:59,010
software set up to so getting started I

1288
00:50:56,700 --> 00:51:03,060
would just I would just one of these

1289
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:05,040
that's or one of these these uh three

1290
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:07,680
STRs and I would get started with just

1291
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:09,420
the open BTS first and

1292
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,770
and setting up that first so now that

1293
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:12,870
that's the training wheels open BTS

1294
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:15,270
isn't very mature and then move on to

1295
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:17,130
the other LTE sit back specification

1296
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:20,910
here's the sources of the jamming paper

1297
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:26,970
highly recommended layer to attack the

1298
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:31,879
the alter attack and then the paging

1299
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:31,879
channel hijacking and that's it

1300
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:38,109
[Applause]
