1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,809
all right this is do you wanna build a

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,910
challenge we can CT up today with Jason

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,439
Ritz key Jason is a nice guy who works

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,519
for a company called Taos helping people

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,769
and companies get more out of their

6
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,450
computers and themselves he specializes

7
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:13,769
in orchestrating secure effective and

8
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,910
meaningful deployments of open source

9
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:16,199
software that help businesses and

10
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,740
individuals achieve their goals and

11
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:38,040
dreams

12
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:43,440
he'll trendy c-56 etf seriously that was

13
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:50,070
way too damn long I wrote it to be

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:53,239
written okay so this is my you know

15
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:56,730
copyright claim initiation sticker

16
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:58,078
always always grab a frame from a Disney

17
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:04,500
to make sure that no one can get money

18
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:08,430
for your work so this is this is a talk

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,590
about and one of the things I realized

20
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,119
last year is that we don't get a lot of

21
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,650
time which telecon closes last I don't

22
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,880
know who was here for last year but we

23
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,009
kind of get booted out really quick

24
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,869
quick and unlike say Def Con there's no

25
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:22,350
time for a really long closing remarks

26
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:24,900
and time to go over anything so this is

27
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:27,960
gonna kind of be a state of the last two

28
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,520
C tf's Union letting you know where were

29
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,220
are letting you know we're going and

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,829
also talking about how challenges and

31
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,298
CTFs get built and what you can do if

32
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:41,189
you're interested in participating in

33
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:45,420
that process so without further ado I'm

34
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:47,130
RIT's I enjoy all of the things on this

35
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,180
and I'm bad at all of the things that

36
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:53,789
I'm bad at I spend a lot of time working

37
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,939
with a group called DC 562 DCFS excuse

38
00:01:53,790 --> 00:02:00,030
the DEF CON group for Long Beach so if

39
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:02,339
you are down here and you are kind of

40
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:06,149
like south of the Hollywood Hills and

41
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,500
west of the 101 will probably be close

42
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:11,690
to you and you might want to drop in and

43
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,690
say hi and

44
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:23,020
this is a shorter version of that long

45
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:24,580
long I I kind of lateraled into security

46
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,440
I was doing just normal system in work

47
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,000
started to do more automation stuff and

48
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,600
started to hang out with all of these

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,820
fun hacker people and started to learn a

50
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,920
substantial amount more about security

51
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,720
than I had known previously and I still

52
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,399
consider myself kind of a security

53
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,120
community outsider and a hacking

54
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,340
community insider in the sense of

55
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,959
security is not my profession

56
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:50,010
infrastructure is my profession

57
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:53,470
and so my slant on CTF is going to be

58
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:56,290
largely focused at infrastructure but

59
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:58,270
also with some pointers and some

60
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:02,859
information about where we are for

61
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:04,590
challenges and and I really you know

62
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:08,530
like this community and they've enjoyed

63
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:11,440
delivering these these CTFs with DC 562

64
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,790
and and it's been good and we intend to

65
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:21,640
keep on doing it for as long as we

66
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:23,920
possibly can we're meeting in the same

67
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,510
place regularly and if you talk to me

68
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,850
later I can tell you where but it's not

69
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:30,989
publicly available and I'm not going to

70
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,989
say it on a recording either

71
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:36,519
conveniently well first of all

72
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,200
conveniently if you have questions and

73
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:39,640
for some reason we don't have time I'm

74
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,790
definitely going to be here for the rest

75
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:45,399
of the day but I'm super bad at train of

76
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:48,910
thought retention so but also

77
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:54,459
conveniently I really do do enjoy CTF

78
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:56,290
and you know I I'd say it's been

79
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:57,780
something that we you know we're showing

80
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,739
up at seven or eight in the morning

81
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,620
after probably like two or three hours

82
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:04,930
of sleep to deliver this and it's a very

83
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:09,220
good time you know

84
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:10,900
come here for 562 if you do go to look

85
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,150
us up there's a little button at the

86
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:16,989
bottom that's an eye that goes to an IRC

87
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:18,880
server okay if you can't get on our IRC

88
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:20,978
server don't feel intimidated still come

89
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:26,070
say hi we want to meet you we want to

90
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:26,070
see you so

91
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:33,289
we're talking about me there's a whole

92
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:35,509
bunch of people and I was trying to

93
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:36,800
figure out who is gonna be at this talk

94
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:39,310
and who's gonna be interested in this

95
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,819
talk I was as I was telling wedgie

96
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:45,169
earlier who as the announcer I realized

97
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:47,180
that I have a weird audience for this

98
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:48,560
talk all of the old-timers aren't here

99
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,389
because they know everything they need

100
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,729
to know and all of the noobs aren't here

101
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:54,259
because CTFs are hella intimidating so

102
00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:58,128
I've got this weird cross-section of

103
00:04:54,259 --> 00:05:01,849
people in the middle and I'm figuring we

104
00:04:58,129 --> 00:05:04,759
ever got people who are really really

105
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:06,080
good or really really bad but mostly

106
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:09,289
we've got people who've gotten started

107
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,430
and kind of just got the bug for this

108
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:12,590
looks like a really cool and interesting

109
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:15,469
thing and something I'd you know

110
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:17,900
something you might like to do I don't

111
00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:19,789
think this one's true though I think I

112
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:25,580
think you're all interested in CTFs more

113
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:29,150
than anything else so go back to my

114
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:32,000
original frame I would really like to

115
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:34,698
seal the deal for anyone who's here and

116
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,650
convince you all that CTFs are

117
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:38,659
definitely something that you want to

118
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:41,299
participate in there definitely

119
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:42,469
something you want to build and you can

120
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,879
either be part of ours or you can be

121
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:49,189
part of someone else's but it's really

122
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:50,539
fun so I'd like you to join me in the no

123
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:56,479
free time Club is what I'm saying up

124
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:58,339
front so let's talk about what is a CTF

125
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:03,878
kind of from a high level so you'll have

126
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:06,409
a framework to contextualize this in CTF

127
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:09,139
consists of kind of a series of

128
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:11,719
generalizable concepts right you go

129
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:14,060
somewhere there's a puzzle that you have

130
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:15,800
to figure out how that puzzle is

131
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,479
constructed could be in a variety of

132
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,120
ways you solve the puzzle you get a

133
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:23,110
token of some kind you reading that

134
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:27,500
token for some kind of points and

135
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:29,930
there's a set time I haven't really seen

136
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:33,919
any CTF

137
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:35,750
that are set up that are that aren't

138
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,180
bound by a time restriction so I think

139
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,680
that last one is is pretty safe

140
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,380
this is Mechanics for a jeopardy style

141
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:46,490
CTF because in the Jeopardy style of CDF

142
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:49,550
this is what we do there are other kinds

143
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:53,120
of CTF too and we'll roll into those

144
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:56,930
later but we're talking about puzzles

145
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:59,690
you know what kinds of puzzles you know

146
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:04,789
we've got our basic puzzles like this

147
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:07,219
one on the screen which I'm sure you can

148
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:09,710
if you want to type that in manually

149
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:11,120
onto a phone you probably hate me a lot

150
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:15,138
so I hope you're watching this on a

151
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:17,030
computer challenges like this

152
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:18,530
the second example you know being a

153
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:20,090
server try to get access to file first

154
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:23,059
examples you get handed something that's

155
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:24,380
something you get handed is a puzzle and

156
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,320
you have to try and figure out what that

157
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:29,570
actually means you know in this case you

158
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,940
might know that in CTFs a lot of flies

159
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,740
come with a string of flag at the start

160
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:36,469
curly brace and the actual flight

161
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,060
contents and a string at the end and you

162
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:40,099
notice that that pattern is preserved

163
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,960
overall you might think you know what

164
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:44,389
preserves patterns like this any

165
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,280
rotation cipher that only acts on the

166
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:48,770
alphanumeric components is going to show

167
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,809
me exactly this I should immediately go

168
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:52,340
to my rot toolbox and just because rot13

169
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:56,900
doesn't work doesn't mean it's not

170
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:59,060
rotted by some other obnoxious number so

171
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,469
you know there's there's a whole variety

172
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,479
of puzzles like this and like I just

173
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:03,169
disclosed they kind of have their own

174
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,289
unique

175
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:07,969
idiomatic lexicon right knowing that

176
00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:09,380
when you have a message like this that

177
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:11,449
has these kind of curly braces it's

178
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:13,880
probably a flag that's been rotted is

179
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:16,729
something very specific to this

180
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,110
community like that's a very just a

181
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:19,190
widespread token format you take the

182
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:23,360
token format away you've got almost

183
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:27,110
nothing so we've got these kind of

184
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,250
idiosyncratic puzzles and people get

185
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:32,209
points from them and they get enough

186
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:38,809
points really fast you know they they

187
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:41,689
win king of the hill CTFs which you

188
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:44,449
don't see as commonly CCDC

189
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:47,620
is more like a king of the hill CTF

190
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,620
without the Jeopardy part

191
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:53,880
in that sense but but you're typically

192
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,529
uh it typically has most king of the

193
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,180
hill CTFs have not necessarily a

194
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:59,329
jeopardy but a challenge south component

195
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:02,219
but then you'll also have a component

196
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:03,899
where you're trying to keep services up

197
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,490
or attack someone else's services

198
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:07,639
simultaneously this isn't something

199
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,870
we've done shell con yet but we're

200
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:11,250
hoping to be able to do it in the near

201
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:14,250
future either next year or the year

202
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:16,440
after words it's gonna be a very

203
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:19,079
interesting space and we're gonna need a

204
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,759
lot of people being very interested in

205
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:22,380
reading a lot of documentation all at

206
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:27,060
the same time in order to make it work

207
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:28,410
well so you know in that sense

208
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,969
everything is on fire because you're

209
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:32,459
constantly trying to manage solving

210
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:34,139
puzzles with handling people who are

211
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:39,060
like physically trying to ruin your

212
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:40,680
point totals so oh yeah like I said in

213
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,180
in king of the hill generally you you

214
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,829
know you have some assets to protect and

215
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,949
some assets to defense so there are some

216
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:48,420
things that you need to manage and some

217
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:50,240
things you need to be knocking down and

218
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:54,360
that's what contributes to all of the

219
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,759
all of the busyness uh you know but a

220
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:00,360
good question to ask is like we're doing

221
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:01,230
all of this stuff like you're here

222
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,540
because you're interested in

223
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:08,069
competitions like what's the point of

224
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:10,199
all the hacker games I think it's really

225
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:12,000
telling that like all the pictures that

226
00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:15,180
well not all but almost all the

227
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,850
Wikipedia pages pictures for Def Con are

228
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,920
of the contest floor because it's like

229
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:22,500
literally the most compelling nexus of

230
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,149
activity in the entire conference and I

231
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,550
feel like the hacker village where the

232
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:28,709
contest that at almost any conference is

233
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:32,130
the place where everyone's busy because

234
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:34,199
everyone's a hundred percent on I had

235
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:35,579
six people walk up to me today and ask

236
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:37,979
you a question and I did not acknowledge

237
00:10:35,579 --> 00:10:40,170
them for thirty seconds or more because

238
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,810
that's where they were my priority queue

239
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:45,630
I am not ashamed of that that is a a

240
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:52,258
majestic state to be in

241
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:54,420
so the I mean we get all these people

242
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:55,980
into a room that get completely excited

243
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,660
and completely switched on by what

244
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,670
they're doing to the point where they

245
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,270
you know I think we had a guy from

246
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,819
another car

247
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:05,010
who came in at 7 a.m. in the morning and

248
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:07,100
he left when he kicked him out at 5:30

249
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:11,580
and I don't think he left in between

250
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:13,710
which is impressive and terrifying

251
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,270
you know you get around a community like

252
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:19,290
that you know that afterwards when you

253
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:20,490
go to the bar you can have people that

254
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:22,199
you'll be able to talk to you I saw you

255
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,090
working on the CDF where you can think

256
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,640
oh yeah I solved that thing too oh my

257
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:27,930
god that was so hard you know the level

258
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,910
that you're working on eachother with

259
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:33,589
everyone knows the interaction that

260
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:35,790
they're having in a really big way

261
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:37,860
contests pull our community together

262
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:39,900
almost more than anything else we do we

263
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,370
have a lot of talks I really enjoy

264
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,380
talking to you up here right now but

265
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:45,900
this is not we don't have that same

266
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:48,720
level of intimacy as we do if you and I

267
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:51,689
are struggling to answer cripplingly

268
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,310
hard puzzles faster than one another um

269
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:54,780
and I think it really ties together like

270
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:59,839
huge swathes of our community I mean

271
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:59,839
we've got you know like the very basic

272
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:09,569
you know I and and it's not so hard you

273
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:11,910
know it's there there are a whole bunch

274
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:13,740
of things that we we have a challenge on

275
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:15,360
the board today that we realize about

276
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,040
halfway through the contest we thought

277
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,920
it would be the challenge that everyone

278
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,380
solved and we were totally wrong about

279
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,540
that because we hadn't done an aside

280
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,250
posting and there were way more people

281
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,780
that came in because they were

282
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,640
interested than the people that came in

283
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,350
because they were experienced we weren't

284
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,730
anticipating that we had to throw in

285
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,650
another challenge that was easier and

286
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:39,090
feel very sorry for all the people who

287
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:42,000
had already switched off so we get those

288
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:47,040
people you know and then we get these

289
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,750
people who you know they're almost tired

290
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,790
of the CTF because they almost don't

291
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:55,230
care but the one thing they are

292
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:57,000
interested in is showing off like the

293
00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:01,140
one thing that they really want to come

294
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,270
here to do is like prove themselves and

295
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:06,540
so you tend to see these light you'll

296
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:08,880
see in CTF there'll be like a ribbon in

297
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,380
the middle of all the scores so it'd be

298
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,080
a ribbon in the middle where all of the

299
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,920
people who are getting started but

300
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,480
comput

301
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,248
like we'll be and then there's this

302
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,779
high-flying ribbon if everyone who

303
00:13:17,249 --> 00:13:24,689
really wants to show everyone how

304
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:27,149
awesome they are and and there's also

305
00:13:24,689 --> 00:13:29,699
you know at the bottom there's a band of

306
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:32,160
people who logged in but don't want to

307
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:34,469
see anyone see them having a really hard

308
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,110
time and so maybe if you're lucky

309
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:40,679
there'll be a thin band of whatever the

310
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:43,379
hello world challenge was and it'll just

311
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:45,629
stop there these are the people that I

312
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:48,269
am most interested in playing the CTF

313
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:50,279
and I think I just needed to like start

314
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:53,339
delivering impassioned speeches like

315
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:57,869
every hour in the halls in order to get

316
00:13:53,339 --> 00:14:00,569
those people in because these are the

317
00:13:57,869 --> 00:14:02,850
people that I want absolutely to be

318
00:14:00,569 --> 00:14:04,979
playing CD f's cuz they're they would I

319
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:10,139
feel stand the most to gain in the

320
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:12,089
shortest amount of time so all of these

321
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:14,369
people can you know if we can get these

322
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:16,800
guys in the room all of these people

323
00:14:14,369 --> 00:14:18,540
will you know kind of get meshed

324
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,979
together in this in this friendly

325
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,089
competition they all learn a lot about

326
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,800
each other they all learn a lot about

327
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:24,300
who they're playing with they might meet

328
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,149
some people that they might have totally

329
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,378
written off that are very talented

330
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:31,110
because they get blown out of the water

331
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:34,949
by someone who's just me sitting sitting

332
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:38,519
working on something and then you know

333
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:40,679
it it it helps them also to see how much

334
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:45,870
farther they can go and what new things

335
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:49,740
there are to learn ooh double slide

336
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:51,269
there so discuss jeopardy Hill there's

337
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:54,029
other kinds of games that frequently

338
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:58,139
don't occur in the contest floor we did

339
00:14:54,029 --> 00:15:01,589
this year our CTF includes some more OSN

340
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:05,970
challenges which are kind of verging

341
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:08,339
into the realm of not pure IT security

342
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:09,980
which is good there's a lot of other

343
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:12,990
things that we're interested in doing

344
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:16,139
there's large conversations around way

345
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:19,589
more contests at Shell con next year and

346
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:21,629
there may be you know if we can find a

347
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:23,279
way to do a social engineering component

348
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:25,559
without getting our pants suit off

349
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,070
having social engineering challenges

350
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:29,260
would be fantastic I do

351
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,370
know how some of the people the SE CTF

352
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:32,860
get away with everything they get away

353
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:34,330
with so there must be some some deep

354
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:38,770
conversations that happen there and

355
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:40,180
there's physical challenges like you

356
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,650
know like datagrams I don't know if

357
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,479
anyone are you familiar with layer one

358
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:46,380
with the Box challenge which is like a

359
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,160
bomb defusal challenge that thing is

360
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:51,490
fantastic

361
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,980
I really categorized this as slightly

362
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:56,290
different from challenges that are

363
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:59,050
things like if you're familiar with the

364
00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:03,099
DEF CON scavenger hunt large portions of

365
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:05,589
that have a less to do with the kind of

366
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,690
I don't know maybe there is an element

367
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:10,000
of weird puzzle solving in the scavenger

368
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:13,800
hunt now that I think about it some of

369
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,800
those are pretty obscure things to find

370
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:20,680
so let's say way away from kind of the

371
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:24,550
the why and segue into the practical

372
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:30,370
like how do we run a CTF how can you run

373
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:35,469
a CTF first thing you need is content we

374
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:37,180
have challenges for CTF right those

375
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,690
challenges have to be developed by

376
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:41,650
someone but eventually they have to get

377
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:43,750
packaged in some way that they can be

378
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:47,319
run so typically speaking what we have

379
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:50,530
is we'll have a team of you know five to

380
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:52,450
seven people creating challenges and

381
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:54,280
then two to three people actually

382
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:56,380
running the challenges so those people

383
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,089
are physically like like old-school

384
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:03,490
development like throwing something over

385
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:04,689
a wall in many cases and and so in order

386
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:07,449
to that they kind of have to deliver to

387
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:11,860
them something like is it a binary is it

388
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:13,360
a gzip file in a shell script is it a VM

389
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:14,619
like what is it that they're delivering

390
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,698
so they have to deliver something and

391
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:16,780
then because they're throwing something

392
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:19,930
over a wall there needs to be

393
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:21,639
documentation so we've gotten very

394
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:25,199
serious about I'm actually I'm glad

395
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,199
you're here because this is yours

396
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,440
so so we get pretty serious about

397
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:34,690
documentation at the point where we have

398
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,460
like a bare minimum set of like if you

399
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,870
can't do this I can't run your challenge

400
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,580
because I don't know what it works and

401
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:43,449
it's like what's the name of the

402
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:45,790
challenge you know what do I tell the

403
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,650
people playing and how do I know how it

404
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:52,260
works because I actually have to know

405
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:56,560
too in order to do something with it and

406
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:58,210
then you know and then hints if we want

407
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,610
to give them to people like if we don't

408
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:02,680
have this information we can't run it

409
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:04,659
right instructions on how to operate and

410
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:07,150
instructions on how to solve it

411
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:12,070
this is bare minimum for us we're

412
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:13,690
actually building this out for for next

413
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,740
year and as we as we get to some of the

414
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,600
exciting stuff I'm going to be talking

415
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:19,030
about later as we add more contributors

416
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,169
we need to modernize it even more so now

417
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:22,000
we're to the point where it can't even

418
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:24,400
be just text we're actually moving into

419
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,680
structured data because we need to be

420
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,940
able to automate even the integration of

421
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:32,080
submissions into the workflow then you

422
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:35,350
need an infrastructure because you need

423
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,600
a way to present the content I see my

424
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:38,770
slide is run underneath this one that's

425
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,219
curious

426
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:45,070
the you need a scoreboard to keep all

427
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:47,830
the keep the scores on it to tell people

428
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:50,980
where the challenges are we're using CTF

429
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:54,010
to you right now it's not the best thing

430
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:56,080
on earth but it's also not the worst and

431
00:18:54,010 --> 00:19:01,300
right now we don't have a better option

432
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:05,439
that's not way more way more intense the

433
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:07,600
Facebook and Google CTF Damon's are both

434
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,590
fairly involved and are able to run

435
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,260
really well because they can take

436
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:14,340
advantage of you know the world's

437
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:16,750
greatest infrastructure without trouble

438
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,669
so I don't have the world's greatest

439
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,770
infrastructure I have three donated

440
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:23,650
servers and two six-year-old switches

441
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:25,540
and someone brought me a unify access

442
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:29,650
point today and it we have wireless

443
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:32,230
because of them so so you need a

444
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:34,360
scoreboard to run that people can people

445
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:37,180
can connect to and get the challenges

446
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:39,570
you need a place to host your challenge

447
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:41,220
so for anything that's that's

448
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,659
a binary that just delivers people if

449
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,070
they download you need something to

450
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:47,610
actually run that services so if you're

451
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:50,850
running VM you need VM hosts to run VMs

452
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:53,659
or you need a public cloud last year

453
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:56,490
shell con we didn't have internet so

454
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:58,970
public cloud was a non-starter this year

455
00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:02,520
we as you may know kind of have internet

456
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:04,350
and hopefully next year we will

457
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,240
definitely have the Internet and so

458
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:07,949
we'll be able to do we wanted to put in

459
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,510
more public cloud challenges because

460
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:13,680
it's becoming such a big part of the

461
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:15,000
landscape now but we can't like do that

462
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:19,680
if we don't know the internet will be

463
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:22,170
there so we also need a place to store

464
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:24,600
all the binaries with CDFG the C T FD

465
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:28,410
CTF daemon that we use that comes

466
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:30,600
packaged in but I know a lot of teams

467
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:34,200
have written their own scoreboards many

468
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:36,510
times you'll find I mean obviously sans

469
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:39,090
is infamous for the holiday hack and

470
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:42,390
being having an incredibly overwrought

471
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:44,459
scoreboard to handle a challenge

472
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:46,920
dissemination I mean when it's an entire

473
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:49,230
video game like that's that's very

474
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:51,800
impressive but many teams have had

475
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:54,750
terminal-based scoreboards where you'll

476
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,159
get a telnet or an SSH session and then

477
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,390
be able to interact with the scoreboard

478
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,760
through there instead of a web-based

479
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:00,930
system so they have to have some form of

480
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,610
binary management they have to have a

481
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:05,010
place to store all the binary challenges

482
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:06,179
that people need to download and then if

483
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:08,490
you're in the cloud you need a way to

484
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:10,770
manage the cloud stuff so for instance

485
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:14,010
we have challenges that are in an s3

486
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:16,340
bucket well ok then you need to be able

487
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:18,930
to handle your s3 bucket you need either

488
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:21,929
you need someone to do it manually or

489
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:23,370
you need to start investigating

490
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:26,070
automation which is an interesting

491
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:27,780
proposal because most organizations stay

492
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:30,090
manual until they get along a little bit

493
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:33,060
when you're starting automation when

494
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:35,129
you're a team of three it's because your

495
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:36,780
needs are so incredibly elastic and I

496
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:38,670
like to tell people see TFS are like the

497
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:40,710
most elastic project you've ever worked

498
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:43,980
on most of the time as you're developing

499
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:50,120
you need like three hosts and then on

500
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:52,320
CTF day you need like a hundred hosts so

501
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,429
automation is very critical it's

502
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:58,230
becoming very critical

503
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:59,850
for us you can do a little bit with

504
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:01,680
shell scripts and you can do a lot with

505
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:04,679
other stuff and I'll talk about that a

506
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:06,930
little bit we've actually already gone

507
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:09,930
through three generations of

508
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:11,820
infrastructure design and I think

509
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:14,040
version four is going to remove going to

510
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:16,409
involve going backwards so like last

511
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,790
year for shells shell con we were

512
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:20,790
actually doing all of the challenges

513
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:23,070
inside of VMs that we ran that we

514
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:26,040
virtualized on Linux and every time a

515
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:27,960
team came up we would run a shell script

516
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:31,139
and we would put in their team name and

517
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:33,420
we would hit enter and it would build

518
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:38,100
the team I'll tell you how that works in

519
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:40,350
a second then we moved to you know still

520
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,939
shell scripts but running docker and by

521
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:44,780
the end by this time this year we have a

522
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:57,840
distributed cluster scheduler which is

523
00:22:44,780 --> 00:23:00,000
its own beast so so the sorry this is

524
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,620
the version one infrastructure I didn't

525
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,020
realize that skipped over this is the

526
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:05,399
version one infrastructure so the first

527
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:08,790
thing we did is we would like literally

528
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:11,490
we have a VM we we saved the VM out we

529
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:15,139
and our shell script would copy the VM

530
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:18,060
mount the copy edit the files and then

531
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:19,770
deploy the copy and so that's literally

532
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:21,450
what we were doing we didn't have vmware

533
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:25,170
we weren't cloning anything we had a

534
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:28,550
linux box and a shell script you can run

535
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:31,770
a CTF with that and we did it last year

536
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:35,399
don't try and run it with 40 teams

537
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:40,139
though that does not work but but when

538
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:42,440
you have 12 it works fine so that's

539
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:44,280
that's our v1 it works

540
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:51,090
Microsoft people will realize it's

541
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:53,010
basically sysprep for Linux so v2 you

542
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:54,929
know we have a lot less steps because

543
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:56,820
we've now incorporated this new tool we

544
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:59,850
moved to having everyone do all of their

545
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:03,649
challenges in docker and then we can use

546
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:06,539
a compose file and now we have

547
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:08,970
challenges running in docker

548
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:11,220
and then we move away from like

549
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:13,830
individual hosts and having like server

550
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,149
one server to server three to building

551
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:16,918
cluster and the reason we want to build

552
00:24:15,149 --> 00:24:18,299
a cluster is because next year we might

553
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:21,119
have internet and so we want to get

554
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:26,129
ready to boom expand dynamically into

555
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:28,080
the cloud and I will tell you that today

556
00:24:26,129 --> 00:24:29,580
if you have been playing the CTF it's

557
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,769
been a little bit interesting we've had

558
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:36,809
some fun problems I haven't run out of

559
00:24:31,769 --> 00:24:38,700
IP addresses in a long time but that's

560
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:40,830
one of them I think I ran out of every

561
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:45,419
kind of resource that I know exists on a

562
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:49,230
Linux machine so so that's that's that's

563
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:51,720
fun so so we may be going back and

564
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:54,570
heading back to docker swarm or

565
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:56,940
something to get away from the morass

566
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:59,879
that is you know Cooper new user or

567
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:01,769
Nomad or similar a similar product but

568
00:24:59,879 --> 00:25:03,360
you know our infrastructure is probably

569
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:04,679
going to stay much more elastic and

570
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,869
moving away from the scripts pointing a

571
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:08,490
direct host model because we need to be

572
00:25:06,869 --> 00:25:11,418
able to get bigger and smaller as need

573
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:13,379
demands and we want to keep challengers

574
00:25:11,419 --> 00:25:15,809
isolated from each other one of the big

575
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:17,369
things that we've had as frustrations in

576
00:25:15,809 --> 00:25:19,470
the past with the CTF is we will get

577
00:25:17,369 --> 00:25:21,029
logged into a box and be playing a CTF

578
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:22,710
and someone else will be logged into

579
00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:24,960
that same box and they will do something

580
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:26,909
stupid and we will get hosed out of the

581
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,999
challenge for the next eight hours that

582
00:25:26,909 --> 00:25:31,889
is why all of your challenges are on

583
00:25:29,999 --> 00:25:40,289
separate containers and they're all

584
00:25:31,889 --> 00:25:42,299
isolated from each other so we've talked

585
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:44,129
about the infrastructure let's talk

586
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:47,279
about challenge creation a little bit

587
00:25:44,129 --> 00:25:52,379
though because I have a feeling that

588
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:54,059
most of you are here thinking the

589
00:25:52,379 --> 00:25:55,320
infrastructure is cool but I really want

590
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:59,789
to get around to making a challenge how

591
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:03,178
do I make a challenge and like it's not

592
00:25:59,789 --> 00:26:05,340
like it's got hard stuff in it and by

593
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:09,149
hard stuff I mean just like stuff you

594
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:10,529
have to do that is harder than thinking

595
00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:14,459
about the challenge but it's not

596
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:18,820
actually hard and I think I think it

597
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:21,680
will be will come pretty naturally

598
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:23,240
the first when I say creativity what I

599
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:26,390
mean is you have to have a place to draw

600
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:28,310
challenges from and so we have a bunch

601
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:29,600
of different people who create

602
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:31,490
challenges from us that come from very

603
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,020
different places and all of their

604
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:35,150
challenges reflect the things that

605
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:37,250
they're interested in so if you come

606
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:39,530
into this process and afterwards we walk

607
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:41,720
out of this conversation you say Ritz I

608
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:43,790
want to write a CTF challenge for you

609
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,440
and I say that's fantastic and you're

610
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:47,240
like what you want to write it in and

611
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,760
you're like I want to write a challenge

612
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:53,090
in about blockchain because that's

613
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:56,360
what's cool if you don't care about

614
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:57,500
blockchain that's not going to go well

615
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,570
but if you're really interested in

616
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:02,860
blockchain we've seen some very silly

617
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:04,970
blockchain challenges that were very fun

618
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:06,199
anyone who went to layer one there were

619
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:08,170
there were some fun blockchain

620
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:13,850
challenges there

621
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:17,150
so I myself always liked to I like to

622
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:18,649
read like old Comp Sci papers and so I

623
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:20,870
always like to take like little

624
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:22,610
footnotes from the authors where they're

625
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:24,919
like oh and you could also do this thing

626
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:28,790
and go do that thing to see if anyone

627
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:30,950
else has read the paper it's like my

628
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:32,870
dead giveaway it's like oh you also do

629
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:35,330
this weird thing because you answered my

630
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:42,530
question now you all know my secret so

631
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:45,100
if you find one of my challenges I don't

632
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:47,550
know why that's it's this hold on

633
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:51,389
control

634
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:51,389
no no that's

635
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:58,619

641
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:16,730
that's fine we'll catch up there we go

642
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:19,160
hooray so this is what happens when you

643
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:22,800
write your presentations in restructured

644
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:25,900
text and compile them into a website

645

[Music]

646
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:34,250
sorry you're all also secret beta

647
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:37,460
testers so yeah creativity skill skill

648
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:40,010
that you can cultivate find find your

649
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:42,380
your muse of things that are broken in

650
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:45,470
interesting ways I like to read old

651
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:47,090
academic papers also fun you know all

652
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:48,440
that software that you pick up and

653
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:50,060
you're like after about 30 minutes

654
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,800
you're like this software is awful I

655
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:53,840
never should have tried it go pick that

656
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:56,440
software up again because chances are

657
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:59,060
it's really awful and as terrible

658
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,200
terrible security flaws that every time

659
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,730
I want to do something weird I'm like

660
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,400
googling and I'm like this thing on

661
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:07,010
SourceForge looks super shady and I have

662
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,780
to remind myself to download it and put

663
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:11,810
it in the folder of things to be

664
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:15,320
investigated because it could be really

665
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:16,820
awful don't like don't dismiss the

666
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,370
things that are really awful those are

667
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:20,810
good puzzles because that's that's an

668
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:23,479
organic puzzle that's a puzzle that

669
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:25,639
someone else made for you all so I

670
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:29,510
basically tricked you into vuln hunting

671
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:32,210
but so so that's a skill you can

672
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:35,090
cultivate just by like not throwing away

673
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:38,510
all of the all of the weird things that

674
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:41,179
you want to do technical abilities also

675
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:44,360
if you're concerned about those you know

676
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:45,890
if you're concerned about I don't have

677
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:49,850
the skill necessary to do this challenge

678
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:51,350
well that's that's something that all of

679
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:52,939
us face we all have to do lots of lots

680
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:55,879
of research when we build challenges and

681
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:58,370
if you know your first challenge that

682
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:00,950
you make is a base 64 challenge and you

683
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:04,310
have to Google a base 64 converter

684
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:06,410
that's fine because half of my team

685
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:08,899
still uses web-based base 64 converters

686
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:14,600
so you don't have to be

687
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:17,990
ya know everyone everyone loves love's

688
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:20,030
web-based converse so like you know you

689
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:21,590
don't have to have to worry about your

690
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:23,510
technical abilities there is all kinds

691
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:25,699
of levels and frankly the world needs

692
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:27,980
more 101 challenges like we walked into

693
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:30,470
this challenge by the end of day one we

694
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:33,800
had a we had a 50% unsolved rate and

695
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:36,290
we'd like to see like a way more a way

696
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:38,629
more diverse expression so you know

697
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:40,610
don't worry you know don't worry about

698
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:44,120
those skills they get cultivated as you

699
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:48,860
build the challenges and and there's

700
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:52,428
something for everyone to make it's also

701
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:56,059
fun like it's really I can't stress it's

702
00:31:52,429 --> 00:31:57,890
fun making a challenge in ways that

703
00:31:56,059 --> 00:32:00,889
playing other people's challenges are

704
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:06,020
not because you have to start thinking

705
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:08,030
about the game of it you have to start

706
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:10,190
thinking about not only is this

707
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:11,750
challenge challenging but is this

708
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:15,290
challenge fun and is this challenge

709
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:16,910
rewarding do I start off with something

710
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:19,070
at the beginning of this challenge and

711
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:20,870
gain a more thorough knowledge of it in

712
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:22,460
the end do I get presented with the

713
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:24,110
challenge in an area where I have no

714
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:26,660
expertise and I have to cultivate a

715
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:29,719
baseline just to deploy my other skills

716
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:32,179
so for instance hi this exploit is in an

717
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:35,020
NES ROM and you're like oh I've never

718
00:32:32,179 --> 00:32:38,630
worked in this domain this'll be fun

719
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:41,389
yeah so so it's it's good and it's fun

720
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:44,840
to just feel free to spin out and turn

721
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:48,110
every one of your experiments into an

722
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:51,620
expression you'll learn you know you

723
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:57,740
develop those technical skills but then

724
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:59,750
also like you you end up getting the

725
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:01,490
opportunity to share every single hobby

726
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:04,220
and every single interesting thing that

727
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:06,290
you have with the community so when I

728
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,880
say like I'm weird reading those weird

729
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:09,139
academic papers and finding the

730
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:13,580
footnotes and then turning those into

731
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:20,150
challenges and like I joke that yeah I

732
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:22,520
joke that that I joke that like I'm

733
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:23,900
looking for interesting people that

734
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:26,150
have read this kind of stuff but like

735
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,590
the reality is that by the end of it

736
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:30,170
everyone's read the same thing that I

737
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:31,939
have and they think it's cool now too so

738
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:35,240
you get the opportunity to tap into a

739
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:36,860
group of people and and show them things

740
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,290
that you want to show them and expose

741
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:41,990
them to new things and and they will

742
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:43,280
thank you for it which is not something

743
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:44,960
that you get to do usually with your

744
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,670
hobbies I know I walk around and try to

745
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,110
tell people about like me being

746
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:49,600
interested in computers and they're like

747
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:53,389
oh that's nice

748
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:55,459
so so you can literally force your

749
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:57,020
hobbies off on other people I give you I

750
00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:01,610
give you a blank brand-new opportunity

751
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:03,620
to do that oh also if you want to build

752
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:07,729
CTF challenges and you don't like it you

753
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:10,069
haven't wasted that much time and you

754
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:11,929
know we want you to come talk to us and

755
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:19,899
build some CTF challenges first next

756
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:19,899
year ain't no reason not to come find us

757
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,759
[Applause]
