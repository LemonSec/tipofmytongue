1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,170
all right welcome everybody this is

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,779
where do I start the first 365 days of

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,790
building a security program with Hudson

4
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:10,559
Bush that soon as the seniors

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,090
information security architect at k2

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,280
Solutions Inc in Southern California

7
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,540
we're not home brewing' Hudson spends

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,160
his time assisting small and medium

9
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:21,020
businesses with securing their networks

10
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,020
please welcome Hudson del conte 2018

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:32,570
thank you having one second slight

12
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:36,570
technical difficulty that's better okay

13
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:38,579
so before the talk I was good I was

14
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,710
asked how deep do I plan on going this

15
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,920
talk is a mile wide and a few inches

16
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,539
deep there is there are a few points

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,760
where I really dive deep but the idea

18
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:50,789
here is that there are a lot of talks

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,210
that I feel like are either beginner or

20
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:58,260
advanced there's not a lot of the middle

21
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:00,690
there's not a lot of okay so now I've

22
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,460
actually started well what do I do in

23
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,899
the meantime before I become an expert

24
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:08,280
who can actually give my own talk and

25
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:11,159
this is this comes out of obviously this

26
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,080
is what I do I work with a I work with

27
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,600
mainly small businesses but companies up

28
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,060
to honestly about six seven thousand

29
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:23,399
seats but mostly with no security

30
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:25,229
posturing so an anti disclaimer this

31
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,829
talk does represent the views of my

32
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:31,170
employer everything that I say I more or

33
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:36,419
less run the cybersecurity division at

34
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:41,790
my employer so everything when I say you

35
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:44,009
can quote me on and a big focus of this

36
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,500
is how to prioritize I've seen too many

37
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:48,570
people who when they start this they

38
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,770
they have their priorities oh well I

39
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,908
heard someone say that the most

40
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,170
important thing is multi-factor

41
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:54,450
authentication so that's the very first

42
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,729
thing I'm gonna do that maybe it also

43
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,829
may not be so this is helping choose

44
00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:01,710
your Intel sources figuring out who is

45
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:04,919
who are the good resources what things

46
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,570
to ultimately Google because you in 365

47
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,270
days in the first part there's going to

48
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,220
be a lot of research and it's it's how

49
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,349
to prioritize so I covered a little bit

50
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,740
of this this is scenario but it also

51
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:18,929
could

52
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:21,210
read my biases or my background i i'm

53
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,620
ainlina in businesses that are privately

54
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,750
owned i think that's important to say

55
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:28,740
privately-owned because i think there is

56
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:31,080
a special focus from apts and corporate

57
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,310
espionage on public companies that's not

58
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,600
to say that private companies are not

59
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,030
targeted they're just targeted in

60
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,769
different ways I work at an architect

61
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,090
and manager level but because I work

62
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,540
with a smaller team I do a lot of

63
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:45,300
engineer responsibilities so this has a

64
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,519
good mix between actually doing things

65
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,650
and documenting and planning most things

66
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,720
and then I have a strong preference for

67
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,240
open source but anything in here can

68
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,500
scale out of open source but the

69
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,170
technologies I'm going to talk about are

70
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:01,500
mostly open source same with the small

71
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:06,089
to medium business point anything here

72
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,680
can scale to a large enterprise the

73
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,780
companies I work force are mainly in the

74
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,330
military manufacturing room which means

75
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:15,680
that the compliance regulations that are

76
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:18,900
on them NIST 801 71 are mostly a joke

77
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:22,950
anyone who's worked with that realizes

78
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:24,690
that it's it's for example when it talks

79
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,190
about Paolo's password policy it says

80
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,020
implement a password policy and you

81
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,430
could literally say my password policy

82
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:32,850
is to have users change their password

83
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:34,980
every 300 you know is 300 years and one

84
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:37,440
character that's a password policy so

85
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,820
there's a lot of room to play around so

86
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,710
while I will talk about compliance

87
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,180
there's also I'm gonna talk about

88
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:45,690
choosing your own path because if you're

89
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,400
having to do PCI or NIST 853 there's

90
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,020
obviously you have to follow this

91
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,580
because otherwise you might lose your

92
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:54,270
business

93
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:57,210
as always management does expect some

94
00:03:54,270 --> 00:04:01,680
sort of results in a year so that's why

95
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:03,780
these 365 days and then with few

96
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,710
exceptions the companies I work with are

97
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,940
all Windows endpoints and servers so

98
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:11,340
there's going to be obviously a huge

99
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:15,600
focus on Windows again certain things

100
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:17,220
will scale certain things won't in kind

101
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,810
of the scenarios that I envision here

102
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,250
are maybe you're an IT and suddenly

103
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,570
management for whatever reason because

104
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,250
they heard about the target breach or

105
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,909
Equifax or something they suddenly care

106
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,470
about security so hey

107
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:29,210
you're the only sysadmin you're

108
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,990
responsible for 300 users you're also

109
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:33,859
helpdesk

110
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:35,540
you you you manage everything but now

111
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,700
you have to get us secure enough to not

112
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:40,430
be breached we want you to tell us how

113
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,409
you're gonna do it in a year or maybe

114
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:44,060
you've previously worked at a level-one

115
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,470
saw Kemalists you've got brought into a

116
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,730
company that bait and switches you and

117
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:48,440
finally says oh by the way you're not

118
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:50,390
working in a stock you're only you're

119
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,270
the only guy in InfoSec so you're also

120
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:55,039
the manager you have to run all this so

121
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:59,930
then you ask yourself oh I have to

122
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:03,950
do what I've broken this up into four

123
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:05,870
phases the the boring stuff if you want

124
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:07,550
to sleep now is a good time planning and

125
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:10,370
discovery it is also the single most

126
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:13,010
important part and a little disclaimer

127
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,870
in this part I'm not I know that this is

128
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,980
typically in the manager level the

129
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,390
people who do the planning in the

130
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,190
discovery a lot of times you know

131
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:20,419
engineers if that's where you find

132
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,340
yourself you're a level one security

133
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:26,390
engineer you're an analyst you might

134
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:27,679
think oh this is management and I'm not

135
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:29,390
gatekeeping and saying that the only

136
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,150
people who can do this type of work our

137
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:34,370
managers but I am saying everyone who

138
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,159
does high-level security work needs to

139
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:39,970
understand what and why their security

140
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,350
and I feel like that's a gap too often

141
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,880
while there may be a few slides in this

142
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,680
that does not mean that every slide

143
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,240
needs to take three weeks some of these

144
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:53,169
slides could take a day you may just

145
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:56,540
talk to IT get your answers move on so

146
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:59,840
where I would start is pick a framework

147
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:01,970
you need to understand how you're

148
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,020
securing you need to understand you

149
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,970
don't want to just reinvent the wheel

150
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:10,370
and think I think this is important I'm

151
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:12,350
gonna do this i iso is is great for

152
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:15,860
certain things I work with a lot of

153
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:17,180
companies that use ISO four for QA so

154
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,520
they're already familiar with it it's

155
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:23,270
almost the nobody gets fired for buying

156
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,400
Cisco if you propose ISO management's

157
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:28,280
gonna like it but it does cost to get

158
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,960
certified it cost us to use so for a

159
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,000
small org maybe that's not where you

160
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,200
start one benefit that I have been

161
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,470
pitching to companies when we're working

162
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:39,349
with an a small app developer on this is

163
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:44,480
using cybersecurity

164
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:47,990
InfoSec as a sales point put the we are

165
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:50,900
ISO 27000 certified on your website

166
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,280
don't just retro actively say oh yeah we

167
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,090
didn't care about your security but we

168
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,729
got breached

169
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:57,229
you know we care now at the beginning

170
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:59,090
when you're getting customers train your

171
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:01,070
salespeople to say we this is how we

172
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:03,049
protect your data do this from the very

173
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:05,120
beginning and I think that getting a

174
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:07,130
certification as a company is a great a

175
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:11,300
great way to prove that instead of just

176
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:12,860
empty words we're unhackable this is the

177
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:17,080
closest you can really get to proving it

178
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:19,940
in an easy way without fluff words

179
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:23,330
there's a NIST CSF it's a lot stricter

180
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:24,920
than the CIS controls but what I would

181
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,780
recommend for most companies if you

182
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,270
don't have some sort of compliance need

183
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:31,630
start with your CIS controls there's a

184
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:34,190
lot more flexibility there's a lot

185
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:35,930
there's a lot more you can do in there

186
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,270
and since there's mappings from the CIS

187
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:40,600
controls to pretty much every other

188
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:43,460
framework it's an easy place to start

189
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,470
like I just said if you do need

190
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:47,120
compliance for you know regulatory

191
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,470
compliance that substitute for a

192
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,570
framework because your path has been

193
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:52,070
chosen for you you can still pick what

194
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,090
you prioritize what you do first because

195
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,340
obviously you're not going to check

196
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:57,500
every box in a year if you do then you

197
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:01,849
have a bigger team than I generally work

198
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:04,730
with and then use this as basis for the

199
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:06,050
system security plan essentially find

200
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:08,840
your framework find your compliance

201
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:11,060
needs and translate it into a way where

202
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,609
it for every control you can mark what

203
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,020
you're doing about it what your plan is

204
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:16,400
and I'm gonna talk gas analysis a little

205
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:21,020
later I know that a huge part of your

206
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:24,859
framework in SSP are is the gap analysis

207
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:27,710
and while while I'm not necessarily just

208
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:31,670
a CIS fanboy this talk does ultimately

209
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:33,079
go through through eight of the CIS

210
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:35,960
controls it goes through one through six

211
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:38,419
and then 17 through 19 and I want to

212
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,669
pause for a second all of my my notes

213
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:44,449
and my slides will be online I'll have a

214
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:46,460
link to that at the end so if that helps

215
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:49,430
you taking your notes good

216
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:51,980
and I backing up for one second if you

217
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:54,529
do have questions at any point you can

218
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:57,709
me or tweet to the hashtag I will be

219
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:58,939
monitoring that so easy way to ask

220
00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:07,250
questions so you don't forget them at

221
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:08,930
the end resource assessment I put I put

222
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:11,120
this here do I start buying things now

223
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:13,130
I'm I know I'm probably preaching the

224
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:18,370
choir here but I'm gonna say it anyways

225
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:21,079
I have seen environments where let's buy

226
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:23,600
everything let's buy a sim let's buy a

227
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:25,219
new next-gen antivirus let's buy DLP

228
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,519
let's buy a finless buy everything at

229
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:30,800
the same time but we have no resources

230
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:33,050
no plan to implement them and then

231
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,550
suddenly three years later you've been

232
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,380
paying the licenses and none of these

233
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:42,109
tools do anything um

234
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:43,839
so spoiler alert you do not start buying

235
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:46,459
things now it's gonna be much later

236
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:51,139
there's a lot you can do with the tools

237
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:52,939
you already have but the the knee-jerk

238
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:54,589
reaction is oh I heard that Splunk is

239
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:57,370
awesome I'm gonna buy it or I heard that

240
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:59,480
you know silence is awesome or something

241
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:00,769
there's gonna be some exceptions to this

242
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,839
that I'll talk about when you buy things

243
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:04,279
but right now I want to talk about how

244
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,740
you assess your resources and what you

245
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:11,990
have so to start you need to understand

246
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:13,399
your financial resources another spoiler

247
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:16,040
alert chances are you're gonna ask for

248
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:17,540
the InfoSec budget that's not gonna

249
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,389
exist then you're gonna ask for the IT

250
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:22,099
budget and if it exists there's gonna be

251
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:24,380
nothing for security because chances are

252
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:26,089
when you ask for what security spending

253
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:29,000
has been done management is gonna say

254
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:31,310
well we think that antivirus and

255
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,750
firewall is security so we just want you

256
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,189
to mail those two things down because

257
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:36,500
that's all you need for security I've

258
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:37,519
seen that over and over again so chances

259
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,810
are less what you're gonna see when you

260
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,920
ask for your budget so that probably

261
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:43,369
means you're not spending any extra

262
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:46,639
money this year what do we do with that

263
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:49,339
well that's that's a huge part of this

264
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:53,630
talk that's also why I have a strong

265
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:57,410
preference for open source again that a

266
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:58,370
second IT infrastructure you may want to

267
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,750
implement elq

268
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:02,779
you may want to implement something that

269
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:04,930
requires terabytes of data you may not

270
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:06,939
have that understand what sort of

271
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:09,250
resources that you can dedicate to the

272
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:13,690
tools that you want technical resources

273
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:17,790
if it's just you in InfoSec if there's

274
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:21,070
maybe a sysadmin figure out who you can

275
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:22,870
who you can borrow what what people are

276
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:25,029
interested in hacking what people are

277
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:27,550
interested in these things that you can

278
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:29,649
talk to their managers figure out maybe

279
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:32,520
I can use these people a little bit here

280
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:34,060
and there this all goes into

281
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,329
organizational OSINT

282
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:39,459
figuring out what resources what what

283
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,660
all is there and then which probably go

284
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:42,550
at the beginning is meet and greet you

285
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,589
need to meet department heads you need

286
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:47,859
to start figuring out what their pain

287
00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:49,870
points are and what it is well and

288
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,100
honestly the disturbance that you can

289
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:53,190
give to their resources because

290
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,450
ultimately most people are going to view

291
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:57,970
security in any of the controls that you

292
00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:02,800
implement is hindering what it is that

293
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:04,959
they're doing so start making friends at

294
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,449
the beginning before ultimately you

295
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:10,239
start breaking the systems that they've

296
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:13,330
the very insecure systems that they've

297
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,610
used for 10-15 years start to make

298
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:17,790
friends before they're your enemy sorry

299
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,790
about that

300
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:24,870
and I put OSINT in here open source

301
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,980
information open source intelligence

302
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:28,660
that could really be added into every

303
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,130
slide everything in here you you're

304
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,990
going to need to go on and ask people

305
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:35,680
because chances are the documentation

306
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:40,150
sucks if I sound like a pessimist or

307
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:41,380
nihilist I've in you're not we might

308
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:45,220
work in different industries I don't

309
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:47,050
know the this is another boring part

310
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:50,620
this falls into the meet and greets but

311
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:52,390
understand your business objectives if

312
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:55,660
you're if you're a numbers guy if you

313
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:57,610
enjoy doing risk assessment that's very

314
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,959
important you may have a legal officer

315
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:02,589
who can help you with this but it comes

316
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:04,599
down to figuring out if this if this

317
00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:06,579
system is down for this long how much

318
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,040
money do we lose do we have those

319
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:11,079
numbers maybe availability isn't

320
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,180
important at all because maybe you know

321
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:14,620
we don't have those those firm of

322
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,540
deadlines I worked with the company they

323
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:19,300
said everything could be down for three

324
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:21,310
days and all we would lose is some

325
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,469
that's your you're probably never gonna

326
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:26,890
find that that was that was weird but

327
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:28,360
and that ya know it is and it was a

328
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,560
manufacturing company but I don't know

329
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,760
the way that they worked they said

330
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,890
everything can be down for three days

331
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,900
and we wouldn't lose a penny you're

332
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,550
never gonna see that now the thing is

333
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,560
because you don't have a large team

334
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:39,880
because you you can't dedicate months to

335
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,640
these things and these are month-long

336
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,650
tasks or three month or year-long tasks

337
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,260
chances are you're going to have to stop

338
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:49,000
these short of what is what you'd

339
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,370
probably want to but it really comes

340
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,740
down to and I'm gonna reiterate this is

341
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:56,110
understanding what you have to secure

342
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:58,410
and what you're securing against and

343
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:00,670
what's the risk if you don't secure it

344
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:02,740
business impact assessment is exactly

345
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:04,209
what I was talking about with the risk

346
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,640
assessment just a little bit of a

347
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:09,010
different spin on it and then evaluate

348
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:11,170
disaster recovery capabilities if you

349
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:13,210
ask IT they're gonna say oh we backup

350
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:15,060
every hour we backup every day we backup

351
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:17,830
whatever we can recover at this time

352
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:21,660
they they have not done a dr simulation

353
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:26,140
do that force them to do that whatever

354
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:29,079
chances are you will find that the only

355
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:30,670
that they're their backups are failing

356
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,380
every few days because they don't have

357
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:34,479
enough space so your are your recovery

358
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,920
point objective is down your RTOS are

359
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,780
down because chances are they've never

360
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,150
recovered it so they realize that it

361
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,589
actually takes a week to restore because

362
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:44,290
they're using backup exec from tapes

363
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:46,690
something of that sort and then I've had

364
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:50,370
where the the boot sector is corrupted

365
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:53,500
on every wit aperture don't ever use it

366
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:54,760
del ruins everything they buy we could

367
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:59,440
talk about that later if you disagree

368
00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:01,150
I'll win that argument well the then

369
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,650
you're the last one that no one really

370
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:05,410
talks about with disaster recovery is

371
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:06,970
work recovery time just because you got

372
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:08,770
the system up because you know it ran

373
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:10,870
and it may be a random five minutes if

374
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:12,670
you're using a good dr system but if it

375
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:15,430
didn't then you just spent a you just

376
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:17,410
spent fifteen minutes every pc for 100 i

377
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:20,500
mean if every server for 100 servers

378
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:23,319
twenty servers whatever it is fixing the

379
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,910
boot sector you know doing something of

380
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,589
that sort you have to figure that out

381
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:28,780
and do this again and again and again

382
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:30,810
until you actually know what it would

383
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:33,180
take a big

384
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:34,979
part of data of business objectives is

385
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:38,160
your data classification like I said

386
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:40,140
understand what you're securing if

387
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,910
you're a manufacturer maybe it's part

388
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:44,460
numbers you figure out that a part

389
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:46,189
number is you you know has a certain

390
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:48,810
pattern you search for that pattern

391
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:50,880
maybe it's anything that has eight on it

392
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:54,479
if you if you do shipping and exporting

393
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,800
to for military things you can look for

394
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,480
credit-card strings but data

395
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,969
classifications figure out where your

396
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,250
data is chances are no one has no one

397
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:04,380
knows department by Department I have

398
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,700
been surprised certain times you talk to

399
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,800
a manager and they can tell you this is

400
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:11,160
exactly where it is and then start

401
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:13,310
securing it then metadata tags or

402
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,569
changing in the you know putting

403
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:17,670
watermarks things like that are good for

404
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:20,279
keeping your data classified but I'm

405
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:23,699
gonna get into the the policies of that

406
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:26,210
in a moment also very important in the

407
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:28,680
Dr simulation is documenting it because

408
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:32,010
maybe the entire team that you use to do

409
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:33,449
your dr simulation half of them are gone

410
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:35,189
or they've forgotten because i've done a

411
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:37,260
hundred other tasks since then so

412
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:41,190
document what worked what didn't what

413
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:46,740
weird tricks you had to do it really

414
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:48,930
comes in handy a recovery time objective

415
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:52,170
recovery point objective and work

416
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:53,699
recovery time i tried to expand on most

417
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:55,170
things that slide would have been a

418
00:16:53,700 --> 00:17:08,250
little too long if i did that and they

419
00:16:55,170 --> 00:17:09,750
were somewhat minor points gone is the

420
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,579
point to which the business needs to

421
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,290
recover so let's say that they need they

422
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:15,060
want to recover every hour but then from

423
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:17,520
the actual disaster recovery in the

424
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:19,470
backup side of it is how often we have a

425
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,560
backup that we can recover to then

426
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:24,800
recovery time objective is how quickly

427
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:27,359
we need to have this recovery done in

428
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,010
and then into that recovery time

429
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,050
objective the work recovery time the

430
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:33,780
time it takes to actually be the

431
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:35,428
technician resource that it takes to get

432
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,950
that system up after the system has

433
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:39,929
actually done its restore i probably

434
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:43,820
explain that somewhat poorly because it

435
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:43,820
is not the primary thing i do but

436
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:52,220
this is a bit untraditional at this

437
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:53,600
point evaluate user education I'm gonna

438
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,910
do it even before I get into threat

439
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,590
modeling and the reason is another

440
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:59,090
spoiler alert you are going to find out

441
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:00,980
that your users are your biggest threat

442
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:05,060
you're gonna find out that that is your

443
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:06,650
biggest gap no matter what you do your

444
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:09,580
your users are going to find a way to

445
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:13,250
get around it so phishing simulation

446
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:15,830
sans securing the human free tools great

447
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:18,950
they also have some paid stuff but fish

448
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:20,899
me has a has a free tier they have a

449
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:22,880
paid tier very good no before it's

450
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:26,090
pretty much the industry leader that I

451
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,070
from from what I see say what you will

452
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:31,280
about kevin Mitnick that is not the the

453
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:34,399
topic here but no before is a is is a

454
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:37,280
good tool a caveat with no before and

455
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,830
this is a nun an unsubstantiated story

456
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,940
that I that I overheard at besides Vegas

457
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:43,669
this year but I'm gonna repeat it

458
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:46,820
because it rains true or it appears to

459
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:48,140
be true if you've worked with no before

460
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,189
any of these phishing simulations you

461
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,670
know that there are templates that you

462
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:54,350
can use so her story of an organization

463
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:57,110
that checked every single check box send

464
00:18:54,350 --> 00:19:01,429
all emails then you know randomized it

465
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:05,449
so the CFO gets an email saying you have

466
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:08,000
been accused of sexual assault click on

467
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:10,400
this link to see the to see he does not

468
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,850
click the link he runs screaming into

469
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,320
the HR department what the hell I did

470
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:16,610
not do this who ever said it you need to

471
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,960
tell me right now the HR department

472
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:20,689
knows nothing about it so it's a

473
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,880
screaming match for a while now the

474
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:26,540
company is no longer allowed to use any

475
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,920
fishing simulation because they think

476
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:32,560
that that's what fishing simulation is

477
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:35,540
know that is being an idiot that is not

478
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:37,940
that is not testing your tools test

479
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:39,770
every single tool before you implement

480
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:42,260
it don't just you wouldn't install an

481
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:43,820
IDs on every single or an IPS on every

482
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,590
single box and then start blocking all

483
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,360
of your traffic no you wouldn't you

484
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:49,459
wouldn't you know blindly enable every

485
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,740
single firewall rule test test

486
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:54,530
everything like you would test anything

487
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:55,670
okay surveys and quizzes stay safe

488
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:57,440
online has

489
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:59,960
some really good ones these are a good

490
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,840
way to figure out your users other

491
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,010
knowledge and then what I would do from

492
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,230
this point once you've gathered this

493
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:09,260
information do target a user training a

494
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:11,240
formal user awareness training could

495
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:12,620
take months to evaluate but if you find

496
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,840
out in an organization of a hundred

497
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:17,030
people that you have five people that

498
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:21,260
you know click on every single thing you

499
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:23,059
send to them and never forward to IT sit

500
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,830
them down for a day and explain things

501
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:27,320
then test them again and again and

502
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:30,260
figure out you know there those are your

503
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,879
biggest risks so focus on them and like

504
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:35,360
I said this is really untraditional

505
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:37,130
people this is usually step 100 because

506
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,139
no one wants to talk to users no one

507
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:41,419
wants to do this stuff if you don't want

508
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,980
to actually do the training for for

509
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:44,390
someone else to monitor the training and

510
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,620
force them to go through some classes if

511
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:48,500
you're if you're not a public speaker

512
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:51,229
but I think this is your number one

513
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,030
benefit we have an organization that has

514
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:54,880
been fish that we work with that has

515
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:57,379
been fished three times in the last year

516
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,559
one time they were minutes away from

517
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:05,809
sending $60,000 to the wrong company

518
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:10,160
okay so they bring in they they bring in

519
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:13,668
a manager of InfoSec to to replace us

520
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:15,020
long story there but I tell him that the

521
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:16,429
number one thing you need to do is user

522
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:18,470
awareness training he says yeah that

523
00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:19,760
that's in my plan we're about six months

524
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:21,169
away from that and it's gonna be this

525
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,580
long thing and I'm like no no no right

526
00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:26,750
now you need to do fishing simulation

527
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:28,639
he's like yeah I'm like no no no you

528
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:30,890
don't understand you are going to keep

529
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,320
they they have compliance needs and they

530
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:36,580
have they have had customer information

531
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:39,260
breached and two of the occasions that

532
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:41,720
that that that's completely intolerable

533
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:43,610
but they're they because however he

534
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,580
wants to do things he's not willing to

535
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:47,750
put the user training at that moment I'm

536
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,730
gonna tell another very interesting

537
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:53,000
story about that same person in a bit

538
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:54,559
but and and then you'll you'll see I

539
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
said planning and discovery here but

540
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,570
then I've already implemented a

541
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,760
remediation into this phase I I done

542
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:03,860
that intentionally I think that if all

543
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:07,510
you did for your first six months or

544
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:08,870
even six weeks even six days was

545
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:10,908
documentation

546
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:12,529
you're losing opportunities so I think

547
00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:13,880
mixing some of these things up and

548
00:22:12,529 --> 00:22:16,070
figuring out what's most important and

549
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:20,750
doing it earlier than I prescribed is is

550
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:23,120
great this may be a point you if the

551
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,620
targeted you if you don't think targeted

552
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,629
user training is enough that you may

553
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:28,639
really think about MFA because that is a

554
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:32,779
while it is not a silver bullet it will

555
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:34,909
help a lot of things here this may be a

556
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:36,919
point where you consider MFA I generally

557
00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:38,480
like to put MFA much later because it is

558
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:41,720
one of the most time intensive things to

559
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:45,880
implement correctly and I again I can

560
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:47,779
get into that later back to

561
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:50,090
understanding what it is that you need

562
00:22:47,779 --> 00:22:52,490
to secure you need to understand what

563
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:56,029
hardware and software you have there are

564
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:57,260
a lot of tools for this any helpdesk

565
00:22:56,029 --> 00:22:59,480
system that you have if you have

566
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:01,340
SolarWinds helpdesk it does automatic

567
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:05,450
scans if you don't have anything

568
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:07,129
automated for this using nmap um then

569
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:09,080
map cookbook is a great resource you can

570
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:10,960
get a lot of this information a VA s

571
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:13,309
system talk about that a little later

572
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:16,659
can will give you a lot of this it is

573
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:18,889
not meant as an asset discovery tool but

574
00:23:16,659 --> 00:23:24,320
it can be a poor-man's asset discovery

575
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:25,580
tool also Active Directory is is great

576
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,649
because you will figure out a lot of

577
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,939
what's in there you will probably cringe

578
00:23:27,649 --> 00:23:31,580
at certain things that shouldn't be in

579
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:33,169
there but it is not enough unless you

580
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:35,678
cross-check it because there there may

581
00:23:33,169 --> 00:23:38,809
be you you may discover that you have

582
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:41,570
50% of your your endpoints aren't even

583
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:43,220
in Active Directory I am working on a

584
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:46,309
PowerShell tool that will eventually be

585
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:48,200
on github that does a an IP scan of your

586
00:23:46,309 --> 00:23:49,520
entire range and then checks if anything

587
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,370
is in Active Directory because that is a

588
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,570
huge pain point for me so follow me on

589
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:56,570
Twitter if you want to see that

590
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:58,460
eventually and then Mike and Microsoft

591
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:01,158
baseline configuration and our analyzer

592
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:03,860
a lot of the same things a little more

593
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:07,220
information and a little more resources

594
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:08,959
I would say none of none of these except

595
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:11,390
for Active Directory PowerShell scams

596
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,059
should you run just blindly in the

597
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:16,190
middle of the day sir certain VA s scans

598
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:18,860
you know if you use open bas you do full

599
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:22,450
and fast ultimate that can brick your

600
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:22,449
system don't don't DDoS yourself

601
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:28,970
and then this is a you know a good play

602
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:31,399
something that I didn't include because

603
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:34,280
again I'm a pessimist I didn't include

604
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:37,550
OSINT in this piece I did not say go ask

605
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:39,170
IT because in my experience one or two

606
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:45,530
of the many organizations that work with

607
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:48,500
actually have proper asset lists so you

608
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:52,780
you could you should still ask but

609
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:57,320
chances are you it won't be fruitful

610
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:59,870
so threat modeling um this could be an

611
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:05,060
entire talk and ultimately this is what

612
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:06,409
drove me to give this talk is know what

613
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,550
you're protecting what you're protecting

614
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:09,740
against the same story I was just

615
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:11,270
telling well phishing the the gentleman

616
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:15,110
when he came in and I use gentleman

617
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:17,510
loosely he was obsessed with encryption

618
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:19,760
and yes encryption is great but he was

619
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:21,379
not talking about disk system encryption

620
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,670
he was not talking about in Kranz

621
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:26,480
encryption he was talking about

622
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:28,280
encrypting hard drives no certain threat

623
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,460
models that might be very important to

624
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:33,290
encrypt hard drives the problem is you

625
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:35,510
could not social engineer yourself into

626
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:36,950
this building you cannot get it is

627
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:38,960
almost impossible to get in this

628
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:41,120
building I've cried I've tried I've

629
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,160
tried other people it you can not social

630
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,320
engineer your way and there's only one

631
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:49,370
entry way they do not allow tailgating

632
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:52,100
so physical security isn't is much of a

633
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:55,429
risk they also don't have any laptops so

634
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:57,409
no one can get into the building to

635
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:59,000
steal a hard drive which is technically

636
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:01,880
the use case you're protecting against

637
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,320
but he's really worried about this but

638
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:06,080
what he's not worried about is the fact

639
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:09,860
that they do not close or lock the

640
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:11,449
server room door ever to me the number

641
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,590
one thing that you would do to protect

642
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:14,930
against stealing someone stealing your

643
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:17,120
server hard drive is lock the damn door

644
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:19,400
or close it but the reason that they

645
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:23,629
don't lock the door is because two

646
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:25,730
reasons one the thermostat is on the

647
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:30,860
wrong side of the wall the thermostat is

648
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:33,980
on is where the the sysadmin the sits so

649
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:35,409
he leaves that door open now he's also

650
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,180
he's the

651
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:39,190
to be the facilities manager so he would

652
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:42,010
be the one that would be able to move

653
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:44,020
this but okay fine so just lock the door

654
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:47,410
into his office no he leaves it open so

655
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:49,710
that the so that the cleaning crew can

656
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:54,730
come in and take out the trash at night

657
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:57,370
so very easy mitigation here now what I

658
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:58,660
wish I had said to him was why are you

659
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:01,060
so concerned about physical security

660
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:02,410
that wasn't in my threat model I could

661
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:04,060
have been sarcastic I dropped it because

662
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:05,170
he wasn't having anything and I'm not

663
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:09,639
going to waste my time on a fruitless

664
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:11,320
conversation but he he was protecting in

665
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,790
something because maybe that's the first

666
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,139
thing he implemented or maybe he thinks

667
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:16,060
it's so easy um

668
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,470
it's not necessarily hard drive

669
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:20,620
encryption well it can't be easy you can

670
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:22,300
just deploy BitLocker by GP if there's

671
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,979
any key mismanagement all of a sudden

672
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:27,399
you lose a bunch of hard drives and your

673
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:29,590
system in now has to resolve issues with

674
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:31,330
25% of your pcs because they can't get

675
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:34,689
to any data because they don't have the

676
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:38,560
encryption key again smaller use case

677
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:40,150
but it is possible so know what you're

678
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:44,500
protecting know what you're protecting

679
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:46,690
against Intel sources for this you could

680
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:48,760
use you you could use common and common

681
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:51,220
sense potentially you could say maybe

682
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:53,640
I'm a private company so I might have

683
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:56,080
certain attacks this is that but they

684
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,630
this is a good point to start asking

685
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:02,409
questions look at the the youth us-cert

686
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:05,200
will give you a there is a website on us

687
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:10,450
site a database on us cert where you can

688
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:12,700
look up previous data breaches and you

689
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:13,900
can say you know in this industry this

690
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:16,540
sighs blah blah blah

691
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,850
you can set parameters so find similar

692
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:21,430
companies how they've been breached

693
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:22,899
protect against that go to CIS so around

694
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:24,490
people's find people in your industry

695
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:26,920
because chances are if you're the only

696
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:29,560
an IT person uni or the only you know

697
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:31,090
InfoSec person you aren't getting good

698
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:34,030
information so go get as much

699
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:36,340
information as you can find out ask

700
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:38,350
other people what what it is you know

701
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,879
that they've found what do you need to

702
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:41,530
protect against and then look in your

703
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,600
own network see what attacks they've

704
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:45,550
there have been if they have kept

705
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,959
incident reports look at that see maybe

706
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:49,178
they've been fished six times in the

707
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:53,950
last year protect against that first

708
00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:56,080
so um and then I place this after

709
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:58,779
information-gathering steps because you

710
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,279
need to understand what it is you have

711
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:03,700
before you can even know what it is

712
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:05,609
you're protecting so and then gap

713
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,839
analysis use the framework that you have

714
00:29:05,609 --> 00:29:09,728
does not need to be with an auditor at

715
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:11,589
this point unless you're using ISO but

716
00:29:09,729 --> 00:29:13,509
do do a gap analysis look at all your

717
00:29:11,589 --> 00:29:16,210
steps look at all the compliance needs

718
00:29:13,509 --> 00:29:18,759
figure out where you are and use this as

719
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:22,539
a and use all the information up to this

720
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:24,249
point for a plan or POA M I hate the

721
00:29:22,539 --> 00:29:26,349
acronym I don't know why you put an and

722
00:29:24,249 --> 00:29:27,899
in there but it's government acronyms so

723
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:32,700
they do weird things

724
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:36,369
a P om is plan of action and milestones

725
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:38,109
so project plan is a good thing to do at

726
00:29:36,369 --> 00:29:44,468
this point so you know what what are

727
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:46,978
your doing things in also quick point

728
00:29:44,469 --> 00:29:49,899
pen test is not a gap analysis everyone

729
00:29:46,979 --> 00:29:54,580
people very often here pen test red team

730
00:29:49,899 --> 00:29:56,738
they want to do this at this point your

731
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:58,330
gap analysis will tell you as much or

732
00:29:56,739 --> 00:30:01,169
more than a red team will you're not

733
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:04,570
ready for a red team they can get in

734
00:30:01,169 --> 00:30:06,820
anyone can get in they you know they

735
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:07,989
could look you up on LinkedIn and get in

736
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:10,869
just what the information off of

737
00:30:07,989 --> 00:30:12,669
LinkedIn chances are so do not waste

738
00:30:10,869 --> 00:30:14,889
your time or money on a pen test at this

739
00:30:12,669 --> 00:30:17,799
point if anything if you're gonna waste

740
00:30:14,889 --> 00:30:20,529
the time bring in a proper auditor to

741
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:23,408
come in and tell you your gaps but just

742
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:28,419
don't waste the money this is this is a

743
00:30:23,409 --> 00:30:31,149
self-help thing this is me preaching to

744
00:30:28,419 --> 00:30:32,710
myself rest someone said this to me

745
00:30:31,149 --> 00:30:35,379
recently I don't know where it came from

746
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:39,549
but I like exhaustion is what our

747
00:30:35,379 --> 00:30:42,549
culture abuses courage know being

748
00:30:39,549 --> 00:30:44,349
exhausted is not bravery it is it is not

749
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:45,489
what we need to do now chance there will

750
00:30:44,349 --> 00:30:48,609
be times that you're going to be

751
00:30:45,489 --> 00:30:52,570
exhausted because you have a huge tasks

752
00:30:48,609 --> 00:30:54,789
against you ahead of you but one tip

753
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:58,089
let's say that you have a framework you

754
00:30:54,789 --> 00:31:00,519
want to be 25-30 percent against that

755
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:02,800
framework reduce whatever that is by 25%

756
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:06,130
if you want to remediate 60 control

757
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:07,570
go down to 40 controls set your goals a

758
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:09,070
little lower so if you pass them

759
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:10,840
everyone looks good but you also don't

760
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:12,280
have to at the last minute work on

761
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,080
remediating a bunch of things in writing

762
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:17,170
a bunch of documents try not to take

763
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:19,780
work home it's not always possible but

764
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:22,930
but try and then take your vacation time

765
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:26,770
if you have it also try and negotiate

766
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:31,150
for vacation for a reasonable amount of

767
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:33,670
vacation time now at the end of this

768
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:36,280
space talk with management

769
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:38,740
I recommend that every three to four

770
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:40,389
months every quarter let's say you meet

771
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:44,020
with management now you won't always be

772
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:45,640
able to but getting your cause getting

773
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:47,950
security in front of them is very

774
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,780
important they need to know what it is

775
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:51,790
that you're doing what it is that you're

776
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:54,370
securing what threats are out there give

777
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:56,770
them news in this now avoid fun fear

778
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,429
uncertainty in doubt I am NOT a fan of

779
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:59,260
it

780
00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:03,730
don't just say all Russia is gonna

781
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:05,560
attack you chances are it if there's you

782
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:07,570
know the chances are they're not

783
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:09,520
directly targeted Russia has enough

784
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:12,520
targets if you if you're not working for

785
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:14,290
a big firm in my experience not as big

786
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:17,889
of a target present the findings you

787
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:19,540
have to this point you know all the

788
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:21,670
documentation that you have is ready do

789
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,930
that discuss potential costs at this

790
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:24,700
point you might know what sort of

791
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:26,500
resource issues you have maybe talk

792
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:29,410
about bringing in MSSP I know that it's

793
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:31,870
somewhat of a bad word I work for what

794
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:33,820
might be classified as an MS sp I don't

795
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:35,530
think it has to be a bad word but and

796
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,730
for who doesn't know whoever doesn't

797
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:39,790
know that acronym that's managed

798
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:42,820
security solutions provider essentially

799
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:46,570
an IT provider the posted focuses on

800
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:48,580
security so this would be a point to say

801
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:50,740
hey you know that I have this this and

802
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:52,449
that that I think I need to buy this use

803
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,980
this to increase buy-in and then again

804
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:57,130
talk about what I've what I mentioned

805
00:32:53,980 --> 00:33:01,510
earlier with ISO as a potential security

806
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:03,190
is a sales tactic so now I know the some

807
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:05,170
very similar to the information

808
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:06,670
gathering but its analysis and

809
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:08,740
documentation this is where you put your

810
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:10,510
plan a step farther you start gaining

811
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:13,690
level two information you don't just

812
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:15,129
have this is what I think you really

813
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:16,630
dive into the network and start figuring

814
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:17,800
things out so know

815
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:20,200
you don't start buying things now either

816
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:23,110
you can if you don't want to use open

817
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:26,890
source that is fine you don't have to I

818
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:29,229
know the resource you know you may not

819
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:35,410
have the resources to work on open

820
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:38,800
source but open VA s is open VA s is not

821
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:40,720
as difficult as you think to implement

822
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,970
in my experience it can take about 20

823
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,790
minutes if you have a good system it

824
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:48,730
doesn't take a lot of resources if you

825
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:51,730
have the ability to implement elk elk

826
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:54,370
that's the elastic stack for as a sim or

827
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:57,010
maybe even not as a sim yet

828
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:59,260
vulnera spur is great for open VA s it

829
00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:02,730
will you don't have to use it with open

830
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:05,200
BS it actually has missus and Qualis

831
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:10,210
plugins as well but it's a great way to

832
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:14,649
visualize and then I I put this before

833
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:16,000
patching because that's one gonna be one

834
00:34:14,649 --> 00:34:19,509
of the number one ways that you reduce

835
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,280
your vulnerabilities so by by doing this

836
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:23,379
before patching you can show a pretty

837
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,350
chart and say we have reduced our

838
00:34:23,379 --> 00:34:29,168
vulnerabilities by 30% or hopefully much

839
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:31,679
more show that to your show that to

840
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:33,940
management and it'll be a shiny report

841
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,200
generate differential reports exactly

842
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,850
what I was just saying and then showed

843
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,350
an lookup for external ports hopefully

844
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:40,179
you're able to see your external ports

845
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:45,909
former firewall rules maybe you'll find

846
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:49,629
something else on show then patchy just

847
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:51,490
talked about this um I should probably

848
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:54,370
go without saying but don't don't

849
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:55,870
automatically deploy patches to your

850
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:59,049
servers that's probably not a great idea

851
00:34:55,870 --> 00:35:00,819
maybe you have them set to install you

852
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:02,140
know on Friday something of that sort

853
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:06,070
and then you check them the next day but

854
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:08,470
I really I do them manually but you can

855
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:09,780
do them automated for endpoints that's a

856
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:11,830
little less of a pain point in my

857
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:14,680
experience you can also if you're using

858
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:16,509
WCS you can release passes patches

859
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:19,440
slowly to certain groups so that you

860
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:22,720
reduce especially if you're just now in

861
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:25,650
implementing wsus and you have 260

862
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:29,350
patches per machine that does happen

863
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:30,410
then maybe we release them slowly try

864
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:34,490
and gather a team of

865
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:37,040
who can help with server patching wsus

866
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:38,299
while it is the easy choice it can be

867
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:44,060
really high maintenance there are great

868
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:46,010
resources to get wsus working but maybe

869
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:48,020
you use another tool come if you don't

870
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:51,710
want to work with an MS SP komodo

871
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:54,230
actually has a tool you you have to sign

872
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:56,360
up as an MS SP but it's free and they

873
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:58,130
you can if you deploy it to all your PCs

874
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,450
all your servers you can patch them

875
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:03,590
there I know Komodo doesn't have the

876
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:05,960
best rep but trust me it's good like I

877
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:07,910
said every MSP and MSSP will have

878
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,320
patching software that could be a

879
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:11,060
security risk as well because then that

880
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:13,940
comes with an AR mmm most the time and

881
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:15,290
then suddenly maybe a hundred people who

882
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:17,210
work for them have a backdoor into your

883
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:19,670
system you need to figure that out but

884
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:21,230
and reiterating when I said in the last

885
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:22,670
slide this is placed right after

886
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:27,290
vulnerability assessments you can

887
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:28,850
document your results I'm not going to

888
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:31,220
spend too much time on this because I

889
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:33,339
talked about it a bit but widespread

890
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:36,169
user education this is when you start

891
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:38,320
not just doing your targeted this would

892
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:41,060
be a great time to actually deploy

893
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,650
widespread user education so stay safe

894
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:44,690
online I've already talked about Sam

895
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:47,390
security human has a lot of free

896
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:50,060
resources they can also send teams now

897
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:52,190
this also security policies are huge

898
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:55,640
acceptable uses you're number one to

899
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:59,210
knock out that's what every user has to

900
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:04,970
sign accept excessive acceptable use of

901
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:06,980
you know IT resources but there's

902
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:09,230
probably 3040 policies you'll need by

903
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:12,740
the end of it sans has some great ones

904
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:14,150
but they're in my experience there's a

905
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:16,700
little more customization that you need

906
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:18,950
to do Charles Creston has ones I think

907
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:21,939
they're about 1,500 bucks those are

908
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:25,279
really good and though that's on

909
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:26,960
security shield if you aren't

910
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,170
comfortable customizing security

911
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,240
policies you're not a writer work with

912
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:36,980
legal HR have someone else kind of

913
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:38,209
outsource this if you can now I mean at

914
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:40,910
this point hopefully you haven't had to

915
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:42,380
do any Incident Response you may have if

916
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:43,430
you work within the organs that I worked

917
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:46,190
with

918
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:48,319
but use this time to start figuring out

919
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:50,119
your policies and procedures maybe maybe

920
00:37:48,319 --> 00:37:51,950
do a tabletop exercise start figuring

921
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:54,430
out with your threat model what do you

922
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:58,160
think you might need to protect against

923
00:37:54,430 --> 00:38:00,618
important is to work with legal HR PR

924
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:03,440
everyone to figure out when do we report

925
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:06,290
to when do we report to law enforcement

926
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,760
I know that nobody wants to do it but

927
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:11,540
sometimes the compliance needs you have

928
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:13,609
to a side note there is that you have

929
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:16,250
ransomware there is a very very good

930
00:38:13,609 --> 00:38:18,230
chance that the FBI already has the

931
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:20,150
decryption key I know you don't want to

932
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:22,490
call them but they don't actually have

933
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:25,040
to mandated report this and the FBI will

934
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:27,618
help you decrypt I know it's not a fun

935
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:30,290
call to make but it is it is something

936
00:38:27,619 --> 00:38:32,000
to have there and like I said like I've

937
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:33,529
said many times compliance requirements

938
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,390
will kind of force your hand in breach

939
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:36,829
reporting but maybe have some canned

940
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:39,049
letters things like that establish a

941
00:38:36,829 --> 00:38:42,260
cert team computer emergency response

942
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:45,650
team where the t's redundant but you

943
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:48,170
know try and involve people from legal

944
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:51,559
HR maybe even different departments you

945
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:55,880
know PR marketing management obviously

946
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:57,980
InfoSec and then IT this is a bit early

947
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,040
to do this like I said but nothing will

948
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:03,980
tarnish the image of your department

949
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:05,390
like poor Incident Response change

950
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:08,240
management can go through this fairly

951
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:09,799
quick because I mean ultimately it's

952
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,970
logging what you do and chances are

953
00:39:09,799 --> 00:39:15,140
there's two of you

954
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:17,240
there's IT and then you it's not

955
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:18,710
necessarily your job IT or management

956
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:20,390
should have already mandated this but it

957
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:22,369
will be if change management doesn't

958
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:24,680
happen if weird changes start happening

959
00:39:22,369 --> 00:39:26,510
even track changes that you don't think

960
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,980
required approvals restarting the backup

961
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:30,710
server in the middle of day track it

962
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:34,640
easiest way is Excel it's harder to do

963
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:36,950
approvals that way but you know don't

964
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,558
over engineer Internet or SharePoint is

965
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:41,419
great don't just create a SharePoint for

966
00:39:39,559 --> 00:39:43,579
it because then your SharePoint admin

967
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:45,440
but if someone's doing SharePoint log on

968
00:39:43,579 --> 00:39:47,750
you know tack on to that if you're

969
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,579
already using G suite use Google Form

970
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:51,530
that's easy and then if you have a

971
00:39:49,579 --> 00:39:56,660
helpdesk system chances are you could

972
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:59,000
just create a change change control

973
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:02,720
a change control tab in there as one of

974
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,970
your incident types now that we're we're

975
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:07,189
ending this face talk with management at

976
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:10,009
this point you've already partially

977
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:12,410
implemented a number of controls without

978
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:13,700
doing much not all the sub controls but

979
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,529
that is a wind show them what you've

980
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:17,509
checked off incorporate some training

981
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:19,430
talk to them about a few more high-level

982
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:21,020
things that you have so far

983
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:22,520
get some feedback on the user pain

984
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:24,410
because management's gonna know they're

985
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:27,380
gonna have heard complaints and you

986
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:29,299
don't want you know you you want to

987
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:30,829
hedge that before you can review the

988
00:40:29,299 --> 00:40:33,230
security policies if you've written them

989
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:34,730
yet and then get and get approval on

990
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:38,230
them so you can start implementing the

991
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:41,030
security policies you've written now

992
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:42,710
we're gonna jump into what I think

993
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:44,539
everyone wants to be the fun part

994
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:47,950
mitigation and remediation you start

995
00:40:44,539 --> 00:40:51,289
actually doing the real implementation

996
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:52,788
do I start buying things now maybe this

997
00:40:51,289 --> 00:40:54,980
actually may be the time that you do it

998
00:40:52,789 --> 00:40:55,460
but chances are like I've said you don't

999
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:59,089
have a budget

1000
00:40:55,460 --> 00:41:01,309
so first mitigation at least privilege

1001
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:03,680
if you have Active Directory that means

1002
00:41:01,309 --> 00:41:06,859
Active Directory delegation with file

1003
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:10,368
servers same thing with you know use

1004
00:41:06,859 --> 00:41:12,230
PowerShell to get all of your Ackles so

1005
00:41:10,369 --> 00:41:14,750
the discovery use like I said use

1006
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:16,970
PowerShell figure out who has what

1007
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:20,329
resources who's a domain admin whose

1008
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:23,680
enterprise admin schema admins things

1009
00:41:20,329 --> 00:41:25,700
that you may not check talk to people

1010
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:29,839
figure out if they're supposed to be

1011
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:31,220
there who yeah who can approve you

1012
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:33,770
removing them maybe you can just do it

1013
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:35,808
and then bloodhound is a tool you can

1014
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:41,180
find on github that is really good for a

1015
00:41:35,809 --> 00:41:43,849
numerating complex ad relationships an

1016
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:47,049
ad is Active Directory I'd assume anyone

1017
00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:50,710
who's in here knows Active Directory but

1018
00:41:47,049 --> 00:41:54,470
if not props for sitting around so long

1019
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:56,119
proc Mon process monitor manage process

1020
00:41:54,470 --> 00:42:00,020
monitor is great for removing local

1021
00:41:56,119 --> 00:42:02,210
admin you you can you there there are

1022
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:04,579
plenty of articles out there on how to

1023
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:06,319
do this but you can see what it is when

1024
00:42:04,579 --> 00:42:08,270
you have gotten rid of local

1025
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:09,869
administrator privileges what it is that

1026
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:11,910
breaks on

1027
00:42:09,869 --> 00:42:14,249
whatever application they're using s AP

1028
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:17,009
they're using solid work whatever breaks

1029
00:42:14,249 --> 00:42:18,629
you can see it in process man monitor

1030
00:42:17,009 --> 00:42:22,069
what it is that it's trying to access

1031
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:24,900
and then give the proper permissions and

1032
00:42:22,069 --> 00:42:27,660
then you know reproduce that on multiple

1033
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:29,160
pcs or automate it by group policy and

1034
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:33,629
I've already kind of talked about the

1035
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:38,609
reduction of privileged ad accounts it's

1036
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:40,559
good I am again a little to my empty

1037
00:42:38,609 --> 00:42:43,619
github a little bit of a shout out I am

1038
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:46,439
working on finalizing some scripts that

1039
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:48,059
I use for creating a essentially a

1040
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:49,799
golden image for a delegated

1041
00:42:48,059 --> 00:42:52,829
organizational unit structure with the

1042
00:42:49,799 --> 00:42:57,509
proper permissions it's just not pretty

1043
00:42:52,829 --> 00:42:59,400
enough to to show yet so easy wins each

1044
00:42:57,509 --> 00:43:01,319
of these could have their own slide but

1045
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:04,109
that's really not my focus here so

1046
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:06,869
firewall rule closures you could fairly

1047
00:43:04,109 --> 00:43:08,489
easily determine that port 53 from your

1048
00:43:06,869 --> 00:43:10,799
exchange server does not need to be open

1049
00:43:08,489 --> 00:43:12,599
to the internet never does guarantee it

1050
00:43:10,799 --> 00:43:15,900
certain things you may be able to close

1051
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:20,429
you can test these on the weekend okay

1052
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:21,869
and but I mean while I say easy win that

1053
00:43:20,429 --> 00:43:25,829
doesn't I don't mean any disrespect it

1054
00:43:21,869 --> 00:43:28,259
may not be easy but the these these are

1055
00:43:25,829 --> 00:43:31,880
things that can really help you secure

1056
00:43:28,259 --> 00:43:34,920
with a small potentially small impact

1057
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:36,929
session lockout you know so that your

1058
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:39,660
pcs don't just stay open for forever

1059
00:43:36,929 --> 00:43:43,019
actually you know 5 10 15 30 minutes

1060
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:44,670
have your pcs actually lock a pre logon

1061
00:43:43,019 --> 00:43:46,499
advisory doesn't really make anything

1062
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:49,109
more secure makes management a little

1063
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:50,819
happy because it's visible by logging

1064
00:43:49,109 --> 00:43:53,038
into the system you agree to company A's

1065
00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:58,920
security policies and you've signed the

1066
00:43:53,039 --> 00:44:02,099
acceptable use policy that legal will be

1067
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:04,049
happy with you let's do it this is as I

1068
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:06,029
talked about encryption it might be hard

1069
00:44:04,049 --> 00:44:08,969
for you to push encryption all pcs but

1070
00:44:06,029 --> 00:44:10,920
added into your PC build list maybe you

1071
00:44:08,969 --> 00:44:11,699
know add a few other security things but

1072
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,619
that's a big one

1073
00:44:11,699 --> 00:44:15,719
just enable BitLocker when you build

1074
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:18,689
every new PC it's already there

1075
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:20,809
cool account auditing I talked about

1076
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:23,190
this a little in the last slide but

1077
00:44:20,809 --> 00:44:25,500
chances are from

1078
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:27,329
I've seen you have a bunch of computers

1079
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:29,609
that or a bunch of users that haven't

1080
00:44:27,329 --> 00:44:32,730
changed their password in three four

1081
00:44:29,609 --> 00:44:34,230
years force password changes maybe

1082
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:35,310
incrementally so that everyone doesn't

1083
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:37,950
come in and they can't get in their

1084
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:41,069
email tomorrow but you can do it by

1085
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:43,560
basically by last logon Active Directory

1086
00:44:41,069 --> 00:44:47,099
you can just filter by last logon date

1087
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:48,690
and greater than 90 days and then work

1088
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:53,790
with HR to figure out if those users

1089
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:55,619
should actually have access replacement

1090
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:57,029
in renewals this is the first slide

1091
00:44:55,619 --> 00:45:00,690
where I talk about potentially buying

1092
00:44:57,030 --> 00:45:04,230
something chances are you have licenses

1093
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:06,540
that you need to pay for so this is a

1094
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:09,119
good chance to increase security with

1095
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:11,490
easy wins if you are already paying if

1096
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:12,930
you already have to pay it it's not all

1097
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:17,669
it's not necessarily that much more for

1098
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:20,098
next-gen antivirus mjv but but you know

1099
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:22,530
something like silence can greatly

1100
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:25,410
increase your security posture can

1101
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:27,150
protect you against zero days not again

1102
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:29,220
nothing I'm saying is a silver bullet

1103
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:32,430
but it does a lot more than typical AV

1104
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:34,980
with out much more money

1105
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:37,348
someone from silence called it poor

1106
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:40,020
man's app whitelisting you can just you

1107
00:45:37,349 --> 00:45:43,050
can you can block TeamViewer with a

1108
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:44,970
click of a button you can also restrict

1109
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:46,650
any changes from being maintaining

1110
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:49,740
applications on the PC with a click of a

1111
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:52,109
button so app Locker is not that

1112
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:55,500
difficult but this is actually easier

1113
00:45:52,109 --> 00:45:57,480
you can do removable media removable

1114
00:45:55,500 --> 00:46:00,750
media control pretty easily you can

1115
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:03,530
restrict by you can restrict any new

1116
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:06,030
ones you can own you can whitelist you

1117
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:07,920
know only certain serial numbers or

1118
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:10,740
vendors or something of that sort but

1119
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:14,130
next-gen antivirus silence I said I

1120
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:16,020
wouldn't talk too much about you know

1121
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:19,950
commercial tools but silence could be a

1122
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:21,660
huge win Network refresh there's a very

1123
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:25,770
good chance that you have a network with

1124
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:27,950
all layer 2 switches and maybe even you

1125
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:30,150
have an old cisco a si that is

1126
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:31,710
throttling you at 10 Meg and you're

1127
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:34,550
paying for 300 Meg and everyone's

1128
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:34,550
wondering why it's slow

1129
00:46:35,799 --> 00:46:40,670
if that's painful then you've you've

1130
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:42,259
you've experienced this network refresh

1131
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:43,670
you know maybe you have the money you

1132
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:44,930
see you're still paying licensing maybe

1133
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:46,849
it's not that much more expensive to

1134
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:48,558
replace with four than that Palo Alto I

1135
00:46:46,849 --> 00:46:51,440
would recommend for Dan that you can

1136
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:54,500
fight me later and then access points

1137
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:57,049
with radius I every place that I've gone

1138
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:58,280
I have tried to put in Wireless last but

1139
00:46:57,049 --> 00:46:59,720
Wireless always into being one of the

1140
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:03,799
first things because I see a bunch of

1141
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:05,209
commercial home access points can't even

1142
00:47:03,799 --> 00:47:07,369
call them access points a bunch little

1143
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:10,660
dumb net gears that are terrible and

1144
00:47:07,369 --> 00:47:12,770
Groff connections all the time and

1145
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:15,799
Wireless ends up being a huge pain point

1146
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:17,240
from a usability perspective so when we

1147
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:19,220
come in and replace them and replace

1148
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:21,140
them with something that will do radius

1149
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:23,629
so that you can authenticate against

1150
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:26,868
Active Directory and please don't be

1151
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:29,299
using WEP even though that is pretty

1152
00:47:26,869 --> 00:47:30,530
widespread here's some maybes there's

1153
00:47:29,299 --> 00:47:35,299
very good chance you're gonna do none of

1154
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:36,650
this but consider it change service

1155
00:47:35,299 --> 00:47:37,880
counts and admin passwords this should

1156
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:40,099
be one of the number one things you do

1157
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:42,109
because you know you may have all

1158
00:47:40,099 --> 00:47:44,089
lowercase no numbers for all of your

1159
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:45,589
service accounts and for all your

1160
00:47:44,089 --> 00:47:47,299
firewalls but it could be very

1161
00:47:45,589 --> 00:47:49,038
time-consuming you can break a lot you

1162
00:47:47,299 --> 00:47:50,509
may not have enough information this is

1163
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:52,369
the number one thing you could do but I

1164
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:54,380
understand if you move it to later

1165
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:57,230
principle release functionality and

1166
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:59,510
hardening block ports that aren't needed

1167
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:05,539
uninstall apps that are needed hard to

1168
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:09,460
do good sim Elk spunk spunk expensive

1169
00:48:05,539 --> 00:48:17,660
elk is great but probably hard to do

1170
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:18,740
ids/ips network based or host based you

1171
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:19,730
can do it with brows something of that

1172
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:22,879
sort

1173
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:25,279
but also maybe not immediately and then

1174
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,569
laps local admin password solutions so

1175
00:48:25,279 --> 00:48:29,270
that you're not manually managing

1176
00:48:26,569 --> 00:48:32,690
passwords on every end point it's pretty

1177
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:34,730
easy to implement for Windows you'll

1178
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:37,460
notice I don't have DLP fin web

1179
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:39,140
application firewall or web filter those

1180
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:41,029
aren't in my threat model you could put

1181
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:47,210
them in and these aren't in any order of

1182
00:48:41,029 --> 00:48:48,859
priority your third and probably least

1183
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:50,630
eventful

1184
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:52,308
talk with management but reiterate that

1185
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:54,680
just because no money has been spent or

1186
00:48:52,309 --> 00:48:56,839
little money has been spent that's not

1187
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:59,749
the expectation going forward there will

1188
00:48:56,839 --> 00:49:00,980
be costs associated with InfoSec let

1189
00:48:59,749 --> 00:49:03,019
them know that because at this point

1190
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:05,210
they've gotten used to 3/4 of you not

1191
00:49:03,019 --> 00:49:06,379
spending any money that's not that

1192
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:09,680
that's not going to be the case going

1193
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:11,900
forward or release you hope so and then

1194
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,460
get their input on the potential budget

1195
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:18,230
because you're reaching the end of the

1196
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:19,789
year it's budget season so figure out

1197
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:22,249
how much money what their priorities may

1198
00:49:19,789 --> 00:49:24,470
be and then talk to them and even think

1199
00:49:22,249 --> 00:49:25,700
yourself if you want to use an MSSP for

1200
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:27,439
a sock because there are some huge

1201
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:29,899
benefits with that there are also some

1202
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:32,809
negatives but outside of the scope here

1203
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:34,579
so I'm gonna looking forward this is

1204
00:49:32,809 --> 00:49:36,970
gonna be kind of prioritizing your

1205
00:49:34,579 --> 00:49:36,970
budget

1206
00:49:37,029 --> 00:49:41,180
so maybe redistribute your survey from

1207
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,970
the beginning where you start seeing

1208
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:46,788
your user if your user awareness has

1209
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:48,680
improved start ask them questions like

1210
00:49:46,789 --> 00:49:50,660
their perceived the the perceived

1211
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:52,160
improvements that they've gotten maybe

1212
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:54,920
they've gotten less spam because you've

1213
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:56,450
tweet spam filter rules measure their

1214
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:58,039
user pain maybe they're really pissed

1215
00:49:56,450 --> 00:50:00,140
off because now they can't access it

1216
00:49:58,039 --> 00:50:01,999
file the way they used to or they really

1217
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:04,339
loved RDP from home and now they have to

1218
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:07,160
use VPN figure out what and figure out

1219
00:50:04,339 --> 00:50:09,380
how you can kind of you know massage

1220
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:11,210
their back a little bit um allow

1221
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:12,319
suggestions give them a suggestion field

1222
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:14,420
you probably don't want to read it

1223
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:16,788
because it might not be great but yeah

1224
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:19,460
and then use your own self-assessment

1225
00:50:16,789 --> 00:50:21,710
figure you know think about what you can

1226
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:22,759
do look at your differential reports

1227
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:24,829
there's been a lot of reports I've

1228
00:50:22,759 --> 00:50:26,930
talked about so far perform another gap

1229
00:50:24,829 --> 00:50:32,809
analysis vulnerability scan where you

1230
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:35,989
distribute the survey ok and then now

1231
00:50:32,809 --> 00:50:38,299
that you've gathered information prepare

1232
00:50:35,989 --> 00:50:39,789
your budget set your priorities based on

1233
00:50:38,299 --> 00:50:41,599
the findings in that last slide

1234
00:50:39,789 --> 00:50:43,519
reevaluate your threat model do you

1235
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,989
think that next year do you think that

1236
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:46,729
the threat model that you establish at

1237
00:50:44,989 --> 00:50:49,369
the beginning is still true have you

1238
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:52,279
seen things that you didn't know about

1239
00:50:49,369 --> 00:50:54,079
at the beginning do you have certain

1240
00:50:52,279 --> 00:50:56,660
risks that you weren't aware of you

1241
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:58,160
found some you know some data somewhere

1242
00:50:56,660 --> 00:51:00,618
that's really important and no one told

1243
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,819
you about it you might have to kind of

1244
00:51:00,619 --> 00:51:04,250
change your priorities

1245
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:06,560
for the suggestions next year like I

1246
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:09,830
said MFA is very important I think a sim

1247
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:11,330
could be very important think about it

1248
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:12,799
network overhaul like I talked about

1249
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:14,750
before and all the suggestions from

1250
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,340
renewals and replacements those are good

1251
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:19,850
wins those are great things to put in

1252
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:21,050
there so now you're gonna talk with

1253
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:24,140
management this is fairly

1254
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:26,420
straightforward because you're gonna

1255
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:28,400
present the budget

1256
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:31,040
you're gonna reiterate InfoSec as a

1257
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:33,020
potential profit center I know anyone in

1258
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,850
accounting will kill me for this but

1259
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:38,420
Infosys that can be a profit Center if

1260
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:40,490
you prove that it's not just costing

1261
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:42,500
money that it is saving money and maybe

1262
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:43,970
even bringing in money by people

1263
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:46,160
realizing that you care about their

1264
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:49,790
security it can become a profit Center

1265
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:51,379
it takes a ton of work but it can and

1266
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:53,120
ultimately management will love you

1267
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:54,620
accounting will argue that it can never

1268
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:58,359
be a profit Center but it can at least

1269
00:51:54,620 --> 00:52:01,790
in it can at least in semantics be a

1270
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:03,590
profit Center present your compliance

1271
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:07,610
improvement goals for the next year

1272
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:09,530
again I would I would probably bring

1273
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:16,700
them down by 25% because you want to

1274
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:18,340
under under commit and over over do my

1275
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:20,000
brain set off for a second thank you

1276
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:22,550
over-deliver thank you

1277
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,410
under commit and over-deliver present

1278
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:25,850
your differential reports and then maybe

1279
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:27,649
at this point used a little bit more of

1280
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:29,240
some advanced training talk to them

1281
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:30,410
about what MFA is what some of the

1282
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,790
things you're doing maybe your

1283
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:35,000
management doesn't care maybe they do

1284
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:36,759
I've seen a good mix so in conclusion

1285
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,410
the TLDR

1286
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:41,080
too long didn't read i actually was very

1287
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:43,220
surprised recently to find out that a

1288
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:45,470
surprising amount of people did not know

1289
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:50,259
what TLDR was I spend more time on

1290
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:51,890
reddit than those people so this is

1291
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:53,690
essentially if you've been asleep for

1292
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:55,069
the last 40 minutes this is what I've

1293
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:57,200
talked about set your priorities based

1294
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:58,670
on your business objectives threat model

1295
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,500
everything threat model all the things

1296
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:03,740
discover everything know what you're

1297
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:06,820
securing educate the users backup

1298
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:09,109
everything because ransomware and then I

1299
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:11,210
would say open source all the things you

1300
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:14,990
may not so don't necessarily open source

1301
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:18,890
all the things like I have said

1302
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:20,750
oh and then by all the things eventually

1303
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:21,770
don't do it this year don't spend a

1304
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:25,520
