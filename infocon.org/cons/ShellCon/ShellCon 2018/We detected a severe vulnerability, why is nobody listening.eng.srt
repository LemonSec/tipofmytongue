12
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:33,329
please welcome Julia thank you thank you

today the main topic of this

16
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,640
presentation is probably something we

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,000
all have experienced you guys are all IT

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,820
security experts I'm not I don't sell

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,329
products in that sense at least not to

20
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,640
you guys and and but we have a

21
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:58,289
vulnerability and and really you you

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,120
come to the business and nobody is doing

23
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:01,469
anything right you're being brushed off

24
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,209
that happens all the time

25
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:09,530
and that's what I want to talk to you

26
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:09,530
about today who would help if this works

27
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:16,799
Who am I I already got a very nice

28
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,640
introduction I'm a VP of solutions and

29
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,090
solutions

30
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:25,229
aka product management for a medical

31
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:27,150
software company we produce a software

32
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:29,880
that helps small practices of

33
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,220
independent physicians have an EHR

34
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,869
electronic health record do their

35
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,150
practice management so all the

36
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:38,759
scheduling of patients and then in the

37
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,460
backend all their billing as well our

38
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,740
solution is cloud-based and that's why I

39
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,780
get a lot of calls from people saying

40
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,939
hey we need to do something right now

41
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,770
because somebody is trying to get into

42
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:53,880
our system and we need engineering

43
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:55,740
resources to do this and yeah I need to

44
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,170
eat most the time say no we're not going

45
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,869
to do anything

46
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:02,969
I'm as I said I'm not an engineer I'm

47
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:05,509
definitely not a coder don't know how

48
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:08,818
that works I'm a physicist by training

49
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:11,550
and and so I have technical background I

50
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:13,359
can mostly talk to you guys but the the

51
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,310
keynote speaker this morning

52
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,690
way over my head I have no idea what he

53
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:22,840
was talking about but I have 20 years of

54
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:25,420
experience on making decisions on

55
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:28,600
whether to do a project or not and this

56
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:30,730
is this is the main aim for this

57
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,280
presentation what are we going to talk

58
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:35,470
about we're going to talk about the

59
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,990
difference of the dynamic between the

60
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:40,359
security teams and and product

61
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:42,760
management I will give you a slight

62
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,040
viewpoint of the business side so that

63
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,620
we can understand where everybody is

64
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,620
coming from shortly explain what product

65
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:54,190
management is and how we think and then

66
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:56,350
I'm hoping with the talk to get a better

67
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:58,180
understanding from both sides how things

68
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:00,310
work so that we can communicate better

69
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:03,700
and find the best solution for the

70
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:05,740
business so what is product management

71
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,089
there is a lot of different names that

72
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,890
all mean the same thing and then

73
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,420
slightly different things but most the

74
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,519
time it's called either product

75
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:17,320
management or product marketing

76
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:21,220
sometimes it's called insight insight

77
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:23,950
marketing outbound marketing upstream

78
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:26,859
downstream solutions it's all the same

79
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:29,950
thing it's looking at any project that

80
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:32,110
needs Rd resources and evaluating

81
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:34,089
whether make doing that project or not

82
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:38,140
makes business sense for the for the

83
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:40,930
overall business so this is this is what

84
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:43,299
we're we're charged to do in product

85
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:46,239
management we are charged to maximize

86
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:48,820
sales and revenue and also to increase

87
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,590
profit margin so that's the sole purpose

88
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,690
of product management we look at it

89
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,250
holistically not only engineering we

90
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,079
look at it from marketing we look at it

91
00:03:54,250 --> 00:04:00,610
from accounting from all different

92
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:02,739
perspectives and when we do that we

93
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:05,650
there are certain components that go

94
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:07,900
into that there is the profit and loss

95
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:10,299
analysis at our business does so that's

96
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,220
where we look where how much money is

97
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:14,920
coming in how much money is going out

98
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:19,180
are we making profit which deals are we

99
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:20,950
winning which deals are we losing then

100
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:24,010
there is something that we call Product

101
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:26,770
Lifecycle that's from the an idea of a

102
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:29,979
project all the way to it

103
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:31,599
secur rollout and then marketing of the

104
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:34,389
product but then eventually we need to

105
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:37,120
decide we are going to retire a product

106
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:39,520
that's another situation where we have

107
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,400
communication with the IT security team

108
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,318
because oftentimes the IT security team

109
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,318
would really like to pull a product out

110
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,879
of the market because it's so old

111
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,620
technology is so old you can't guarantee

112
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:53,530
that it is still safe to be out there

113
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,389
and usually there is a business reason

114
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:57,698
why it stays sometimes it's just

115
00:04:55,389 --> 00:05:00,430
laziness but oftentimes there's a good

116
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:02,590
business reason why it stays then

117
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:05,440
planning and forecasting we're the ones

118
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:07,919
that create roadmaps and oftentimes

119
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,599
honestly they are pie in the sky but

120
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:13,240
more often than not there's actually a

121
00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:15,400
reason why we created a product roadmap

122
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,520
why we want to go a certain direction

123
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:21,250
why we're investing in certain areas of

124
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,258
the business why we are investing in

125
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,979
engineering resources in a particular

126
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:29,229
area and then the area of production

127
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:31,419
that's most the time in a software

128
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:33,818
company that's actually engineering

129
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:36,250
coding but when I was working for

130
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:37,690
medical device companies where they

131
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:40,090
actually make hardware that also

132
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:42,699
includes the actual physical making off

133
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:45,460
of the product so we're involved in that

134
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:48,250
as well and then as I said the marketing

135
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:50,650
and launch of any product so we're the

136
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,750
ones that provide the input into what is

137
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:55,659
the marketing message that is being

138
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:58,060
provided to the field how are we

139
00:05:55,659 --> 00:06:00,069
differentiate to our competitors how do

140
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:03,340
we differentiate between our own product

141
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:05,650
lines and and who is our market and then

142
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,719
we monitor the market and the product in

143
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:10,840
the market when it's out there how is it

144
00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:13,060
performing what are clients saying is it

145
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,650
coming to an end do we need more

146
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,419
innovation do we need to change

147
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:18,609
something was there another innovation

148
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:21,779
in a different area that will guide us

149
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:24,880
into a new area so though that's

150
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:27,819
predominantly what we're doing and while

151
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,490
we are doing that I already said that

152
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:33,250
the whole focus is how to maximize the

153
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:37,649
impact how do we maximize the benefit of

154
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:39,999
that product for the business we are

155
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:42,549
effectively with that

156
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:45,369
with that responsibility the gatekeepers

157
00:06:42,549 --> 00:06:47,318
to Rd anybody who wants Rd resources

158
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:50,379
typically has to go to product

159
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:52,509
management and present a case and say we

160
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:54,429
need to do this I need resources for

161
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:58,809
this particular project to get done and

162
00:06:54,429 --> 00:07:00,578
most the time we say no we prioritize

163
00:06:58,809 --> 00:07:03,129
the different projects that's how we say

164
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:06,789
no or yes to a project there is certain

165
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:08,979
categories that I will talk about on you

166
00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:11,619
know what we are doing in order to

167
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:16,719
qualify a project or disqualify a

168
00:07:11,619 --> 00:07:18,549
project and this is done predominantly

169
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:20,949
through a business analysis and we will

170
00:07:18,549 --> 00:07:22,179
go through that it's it's actually if

171
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:25,029
you think about it's a very simple

172
00:07:22,179 --> 00:07:27,518
simple process but we get paid the big

173
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:31,360
bucks so you know we have to go through

174
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:35,009
it already in my introduction kind of

175
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:38,319
said why why am i presenting right and

176
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:40,209
on a very frequent basis I have the

177
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,489
scenario that's that's on the board and

178
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:46,089
I'm getting a random email from somebody

179
00:07:42,489 --> 00:07:48,188
who said hey looping and Julia because I

180
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:50,379
don't know thought she should know and

181
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:55,449
it's usually an email that has been

182
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:58,300
going on 10 15 20 exchanges and it's

183
00:07:55,449 --> 00:08:01,269
some from my perspective some random IT

184
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:03,999
security guy screaming at an engineer

185
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:06,519
that there is a vulnerability saying we

186
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:09,879
have to fix it absolutely right now and

187
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:11,649
he wants one or two scrum teams and this

188
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:13,749
needs to be done absolutely right now

189
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:17,199
right like absolutely there is no way

190
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:19,619
this is a huge vulnerability and and and

191
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,059
that's that's all that's in that email

192
00:08:19,619 --> 00:08:24,009
there is no information where did it

193
00:08:22,059 --> 00:08:26,949
come from except the guy that sent it

194
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:28,899
he's an IT security guy so he he knows

195
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:30,909
what he's doing right he really knows

196
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:34,149
but other than that I don't know

197
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:36,370
anything about it and we do agile

198
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:39,250
development so we have scrum teams that

199
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:42,308
work on two-week increments and and they

200
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:44,680
want people to drop everything and and

201
00:08:42,308 --> 00:08:47,529
go on this project and I say absolutely

202
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:49,410
not the scrum team is continuing what

203
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:52,660
they were assigned to do for this scrum

204
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:53,850
we are not we are not changing anything

205
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,860
so the response you

206
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:59,490
from me if you approach me this way is

207
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:01,560
absolute pushback and why am i pushing

208
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:03,420
back because I don't know anything I

209
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,819
need to make a business decision on

210
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:08,180
whether or not this project is important

211
00:09:05,819 --> 00:09:11,339
enough to interrupt our entire

212
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:14,370
development process or not I don't know

213
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:17,880
which systems are affected what kind of

214
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:20,069
data is affected is it patient data that

215
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:23,220
my clients have been entering into the

216
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:25,319
EHR and and because it's patient data

217
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:28,639
you know that's a huge security risk

218
00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:31,529
right is it as my data base affected is

219
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:33,750
you know is it just quote unquote just

220
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:35,670
my application is the risk just that we

221
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:39,089
are going to be down for a few hours or

222
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:41,849
is the risk that somebody is absorbing

223
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:43,649
the the data for several million

224
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,600
patients that makes a huge difference

225
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:51,209
for me at least when I make that

226
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:54,600
decision then the next question is have

227
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:56,910
you done any evaluation like how long it

228
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,310
will take to figure out are we even are

229
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:02,490
we even affected did you just read this

230
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:04,859
in the newspaper and or it was in a chat

231
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:08,189
room and it was the latest vulnerability

232
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:10,529
that got promoted I don't know some some

233
00:10:08,189 --> 00:10:12,990
magazine or some chat room or is this

234
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:15,060
actually something that you know is

235
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:18,480
known out there and we need to know

236
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:20,459
about it and then of course like do we

237
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,790
have any idea how long it will take to

238
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:26,369
fix this is there is there any idea as

239
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:29,639
to how many engineers you need what kind

240
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:31,620
of engineers you need and then you know

241
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:33,269
what's the skill set of the people that

242
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,889
you need maybe it's the products team

243
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:36,389
and not the engineering team that you

244
00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:39,360
don't need maybe it's it's a different

245
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:40,920
group that all together and maybe we

246
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,350
don't have the expertise and we need to

247
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,569
bring somebody in so those those are the

248
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:47,610
questions that I will push back with and

249
00:10:45,569 --> 00:10:49,349
I say until we have answered the

250
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:51,120
majority of these questions there no

251
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,829
decision will be made and you are not

252
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,730
going to get any resources to do

253
00:10:52,829 --> 00:10:59,849
anything the reason I am pushing back is

254
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:02,189
there is two major tools that product

255
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:05,120
managers or any business person uses and

256
00:11:02,189 --> 00:11:07,009
that's a business case or a business

257
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,100
and those terms have been throwing

258
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:13,249
around a lot effectively a business case

259
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:15,589
is for an exact existing business or

260
00:11:13,249 --> 00:11:17,569
product and a business plan is for

261
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:19,490
anything that's new since we're

262
00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:22,219
detecting a vulnerability we're

263
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:25,189
affecting an existing business and so we

264
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:27,050
need to enter any information in our

265
00:11:25,189 --> 00:11:30,379
minds at least we don't always have to

266
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:32,779
formalize it but we need to look into a

267
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:35,149
business case and what this business

268
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:37,040
case could potentially look like because

269
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:39,079
this business case will be compared to

270
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,719
all the other business cases that we

271
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:43,430
have that we made a decision on to move

272
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:49,329
forward with this specific engineering

273
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:52,910
project and a business case has very

274
00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:55,189
simple components that need to be

275
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:57,649
answered and I'm not saying the IT

276
00:11:55,189 --> 00:11:58,819
department or the IT security department

277
00:11:57,649 --> 00:12:01,100
has to do all of this it's the

278
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:04,430
responsibility of product management but

279
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:06,589
they will ask the questions necessary to

280
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:11,149
fill in the blanks in this business case

281
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:13,639
in order to to make a decision so the

282
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:15,920
first item of course is a short

283
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:19,309
description if we can't find the right

284
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,800
words to explain in a simple way like me

285
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:23,350
I'm not an IT person if you tell me I

286
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,750
have no idea

287
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:28,740
jenkins system and we need to do eggs

288
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:31,690
unlike i have no idea what that means i

289
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:33,850
honestly i tell me what this means

290
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:35,740
doesn't mean my clients cannot enter

291
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:37,780
anything doesn't mean engineering cannot

292
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:41,230
do their work you know tell me exactly

293
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:45,010
what's going on in more or less layman

294
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:47,650
terms that's the first time and because

295
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:50,020
not only because I'm not an engineer or

296
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:51,040
an IT person it's also the person and I

297
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,410
report to

298
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,240
they usually have no clue or even less

299
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:57,240
clue than I have right there and they're

300
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:01,030
probably salesperson people there

301
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:03,970
they're c-suite people that that will

302
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:05,709
not care where there is something you

303
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:09,160
know it is broken they just want to sell

304
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:11,290
stuff and they want to make money then

305
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:14,079
the next item after a short description

306
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:15,640
of the problem I need to know a short

307
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:19,480
description of what the solution could

308
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:21,850
be is the solution to rebuild the entire

309
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,490
software is the solution to shut down

310
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:27,940
certain baton databases is the solution

311
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:31,090
to I don't know upgrade to a newer

312
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:33,850
version of TLS is if you tell me what

313
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:37,290
what your what you think is in the best

314
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:40,660
solution for this for this problem and

315
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:42,310
then we have to evaluate the cost of

316
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:44,890
implementation and I understand that

317
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:47,380
most of time the IT security team cannot

318
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:49,420
do that then we need engineering to come

319
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,620
in or whoever the resources are they

320
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,829
need to look at it

321
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:57,220
to say well we need a for scrum team for

322
00:13:53,830 --> 00:14:01,810
three weeks however long and we put that

323
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:03,820
in there on the cross side we need to

324
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:05,619
know exactly what kind of people we need

325
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,360
because they might not all be on one

326
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,100
surrounding that you might need to have

327
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,750
two poor people from one post route team

328
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:13,360
so those are the things that that we

329
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:16,360
need to know and then tell me if we

330
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:20,230
don't do this what happens right so if

331
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:22,990
we decide not to fix whatever problems

332
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:25,870
we have what is the potential risk that

333
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:28,330
we are we're engaging in because this is

334
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:30,580
again but there's a decision on doing

335
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:32,320
things and we can do multiple things but

336
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:34,870
there's also the risk of not doing

337
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,560
things and sometimes the reality is we

338
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:42,790
will not do anything and finally there's

339
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:46,239
a time line so even when you have the

340
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:47,920
resources you know how many hours is

341
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,110
there something is there an event

342
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,180
happening

343
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:53,160
that we need to take into account is

344
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:55,620
this a software version that we are

345
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,810
going to retire in three months anyway

346
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,370
does it make sense to put a fix in right

347
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:01,800
now that takes two months to do it's

348
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:04,140
only in the market for months so those

349
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,170
are the the items that we need to talk

350
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,170
about

351
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:18,209
the biggest step then that the product

352
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:23,670
management team has to do is to provide

353
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:26,099
a report or provide a proposal to people

354
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:29,399
to actually have the power and figure

355
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:31,440
out okay what is our recommendation are

356
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:34,920
we going to do this or are we not going

357
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,950
to do this and if I can only say that I

358
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,990
don't know person act strong from IT

359
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:42,930
security told me to fix this

360
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:46,440
my executive team will shut it down if I

361
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:48,870
don't have data to support my case this

362
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,250
will not get done and that's why I've

363
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:53,490
been pushing back that's why I've been

364
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:56,310
asking all these questions so I need to

365
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:58,470
know exactly what's the impact of doing

366
00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:02,699
or not doing this and that's why I've

367
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:05,880
been asking you or your counterparts of

368
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:09,149
like what what is it that that we are

369
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:12,630
actually talking about here what does it

370
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:14,790
take to do it is it is a quick thing is

371
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:18,480
it something that we can bring in from

372
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:25,020
the outside is it even worth doing those

373
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:26,700
are they big questions and then as I

374
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:28,340
said was it with the timeliness how

375
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,560
quickly does it

376
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:33,050
if there is a known vulnerability out

377
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,709
there that everybody knows about so if I

378
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:38,780
can go with it and figure out like

379
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:41,300
somebody has already like an extensive

380
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:43,130
written write-up about it and I

381
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,719
understand what's written in there it's

382
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:47,420
probably very known because by the time

383
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,410
I find it everybody should be able to

384
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:53,990
find it and we probably need to fix it

385
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:57,199
so that's that's the basic concept of

386
00:16:53,990 --> 00:17:01,520
how product management of things and how

387
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:03,050
we how we work we compare all the

388
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,970
information that we gather for this

389
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:07,430
particular case with all the information

390
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:10,310
we have about our other items and in my

391
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:12,440
my case for for health care

392
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:15,250
we have regulatory requirements that

393
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:17,870
usually trump everything else if we have

394
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:19,369
most of you guys will be familiar if you

395
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:22,879
ever have gone to a doctor

396
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:25,879
we have HIPPA which is a you know a huge

397
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,370
item at least in theory for everybody

398
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:31,610
you go to any dentist there violating

399
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:34,459
their HIPPA regulations but we all try

400
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:38,060
we all try to be vigilant when we have a

401
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:42,560
HIPAA violation in our software all

402
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:45,560
hands on deck if we have a regulation

403
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:47,149
that allows physicians to be paid for

404
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:50,210
the services that they are actually

405
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:52,850
providing that is another item that will

406
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:55,580
trump out almost any other item on the

407
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:57,800
list and then of course we have anything

408
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:00,470
that has to do with with uptime or

409
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:02,350
sominus of the system those kinds

410
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:05,210
usually trump everything else as well

411
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:07,789
and then and then we have product

412
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:11,240
improvements customer requests are those

413
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:14,090
items and then of course I have sales in

414
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:16,070
my back yelling at me for they have

415
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:18,020
these three potential customers that

416
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:20,360
want this one feature that probably

417
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:22,129
nobody else will ever use but they

418
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,780
really need it in order to close their

419
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:26,690
deal so those are the other people that

420
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:29,090
are constantly pushing on me trying to

421
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:32,330
get resources to get this one thing done

422
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:34,459
for their favorite customer and we have

423
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:39,289
to squeeze whatever you guys are

424
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:42,580
reporting and into that model and that's

425
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:46,190
kind of why I'm here I really wanted to

426
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:48,049
talk to you guys about you know how are

427
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:51,110
we thinking what are we doing we're not

428
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:52,700
trying to brush you off and say oh you

429
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:55,309
guys don't matter we don't care about

430
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,870
you it's really about we don't

431
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:58,399
understand what you guys are doing you

432
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:00,889
guys are experts you're probably hiding

433
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,080
paint where you you know you know what

434
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:05,720
you're doing we need your help to

435
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:08,000
understand what you're telling us so

436
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:10,909
that we can figure out whether we need

437
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,030
to do this I had a case earlier this

438
00:19:10,909 --> 00:19:16,820
year where somebody like like the email

439
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:18,440
exchange that our reference was saying

440
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:22,100
well we have a vulnerability in our

441
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:24,470
database well we have like 20 databases

442
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:26,199
that we use that doesn't mean anything

443
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:28,870
to me if you tell me there

444
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,180
in the database I know Google is of

445
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:33,879
course and you know some companies that

446
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:36,100
are trusted had already reported on this

447
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:40,360
vulnerability so it's not a completely

448
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:42,879
unreasonable request I get this but tell

449
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,530
me more tell me like what's going on

450
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,320
with the system and that person could

451
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:49,560
you tell me whether patient data was

452
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,879
affected he couldn't tell me whether

453
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:54,220
accessibility for our clients was

454
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,080
affected he just didn't have any answers

455
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:58,090
he didn't even know how many of my

456
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:04,210
databases were affected and and I have

457
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:06,370
to push back on this so what I encourage

458
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:09,280
you to do is work with your product

459
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:11,800
management team go to them and and talk

460
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:15,129
to them and say okay when we detect a

461
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:17,260
vulnerability whatever tool we use is

462
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:19,740
there a certain process that you would

463
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:24,129
like to use so that we can talk to you

464
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:26,290
is there is there anything that you know

465
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:28,600
you need to know before you can make a

466
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:32,680
decision whether or not a vulnerability

467
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:35,469
should be closed or not when you report

468
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:37,270
something identify where that

469
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:39,490
information came from if you did a

470
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:42,400
vulnerability scanning from a credible

471
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:44,230
you know company probably most product

472
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,360
managers will know the handful of

473
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:49,270
companies that are out there and you say

474
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:51,879
well what we're doing is every night we

475
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:53,920
run a certain scan and we pick the top

476
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,760
five things and we need to fix them

477
00:20:53,920 --> 00:21:00,180
right you probably have plans like that

478
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:03,760
talk to me about it come to me and say

479
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:05,920
Julia October 1st we start a new project

480
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,110
for the next three months we are going

481
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,900
to be really on your case because we're

482
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:13,209
doing this new process and there's a lot

483
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,740
of new input that's coming in and we

484
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:16,440
need

485
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:19,790
have resources available so that we can

486
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:22,200
fix what we are finding we would be

487
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:24,300
negligent if we are not fixing what

488
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,120
we're finding I totally get that and we

489
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:30,540
want to fix whatever we can when you do

490
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:34,409
the scans tell me which systems did you

491
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:36,510
scan so that I can I can understand what

492
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:40,440
part of the business is affected is it

493
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:42,360
my back up is my front and what is it is

494
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,530
it something that engineering tells me

495
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,020
if this fails

496
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:48,149
we're down four months well that's the

497
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:50,760
problem I'll fix that right okay right

498
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:54,120
like we cannot we cannot do that our

499
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:56,910
clients you know depend on us being

500
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:59,850
available 24/7 so that they can treat

501
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:02,730
their patients so we cannot you know

502
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:10,610
obviously be down for any long amount of

503
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:12,630
time and then give me the good weather

504
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:15,540
scenario and give me the bad weather

505
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:17,970
scenario tell me what happens if it

506
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:20,460
really gets bad if I can paint the

507
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:23,520
picture to somebody else if I can tell a

508
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:27,450
story to my executive team what happens

509
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:30,210
I have a situation right now where it's

510
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:32,340
not a mom and IIT vulnerability it's a

511
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:35,910
different kind of Oh book that we have

512
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:38,070
in the system and you know I can paint a

513
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:41,370
very clear picture that if somebody

514
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:43,530
explores this then then things go bad

515
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:45,750
for the business and you will always

516
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:47,910
have those items you will always in a

517
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,350
normal business you will always have one

518
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:51,300
or two of those items that are

519
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:54,510
threatening your business you either

520
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:57,030
have a technical debt that you didn't

521
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:59,879
take care of from like five years ago or

522
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:02,830
you you grow too fast and you can't keep

523
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:05,200
up with with the amount of data that you

524
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:07,570
creating or whatever the the situation

525
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,519
was there's a handful of different

526
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:12,668
scenarios and you always have at least

527
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:14,500
one of them so tell me a good weather

528
00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:16,720
scenario and tell me the bad weather

529
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:20,490
scenarios so that we get the full

530
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:23,200
picture also what is most likely a

531
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:26,289
probability of this happening if you can

532
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,570
I understand like if you asked engineers

533
00:23:26,289 --> 00:23:30,669
about probability or confidence novels

534
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:33,340
they're like they like they get they get

535
00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:35,350
funny face right and and I understand

536
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:37,658
that I I wouldn't want to like put a

537
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:40,090
firm number on something either but give

538
00:23:37,659 --> 00:23:42,940
me a range I help me out

539
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:48,100
so that I can tell the story to the next

540
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:50,529
person if this vulnerability that you

541
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:54,850
just detected has been around for five

542
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:58,450
years I'm not discounting that the

543
00:23:54,850 --> 00:24:01,418
vulnerability exists maybe it's not as

544
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:03,730
critical as we think it is you know if

545
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:07,269
you tell me that that this has been

546
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:09,929
around for forever and it wasn't fixed

547
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:12,850
by any software upgrades that we did

548
00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:15,070
there is a high likelihood that I will

549
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:18,760
put it lower on the priority list if it

550
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:21,010
was is one that's brand-new and that has

551
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:23,260
been in the news the last three days I

552
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:26,620
probably panic a little bit if it's on

553
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:28,929
the New York New York on the New Yorker

554
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:31,570
on any other newspaper as Washington

555
00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:34,360
Post front-page probably freaked out a

556
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:37,210
little bit right and I will I would have

557
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:39,219
to figure out a way to get a vulnerable

558
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:41,740
that made it that far out I need to

559
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:43,330
probably address it so tell me if you if

560
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:46,059
you already know it's out there and

561
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:50,020
people are talking about it tell me that

562
00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:53,440
it is out there that informs me about

563
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:56,470
the perceived urgency of that fix so is

564
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,809
it something that well we know but

565
00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:01,690
there's this one printer or somewhere in

566
00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:06,539
the system that still runs on Windows 95

567
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:08,740
and it's just a printer you know I

568
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:10,510
you're not gonna get engineering

569
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:13,419
resources for that we buy your printer

570
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:15,460
tell me you know I you probably wouldn't

571
00:25:13,419 --> 00:25:20,080
even come to me with that example but

572
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:22,690
I'm just giving it a sniff done and then

573
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,639
is there any information that you think

574
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:26,470
is necessary for it the engineering

575
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,350
department to actually do their job I

576
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:30,940
know you will work together but we need

577
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:33,250
to put it in writing somehow so that

578
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:35,080
they can give me an F for destiny so

579
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:37,870
what is what is additional information

580
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:40,059
that's out there that you know about if

581
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:41,678
it is a TLS update you probably don't

582
00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:43,330
need to tell me anything more they know

583
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,669
how to do that they have done it a bunch

584
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:48,279
of times but if it is something else

585
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:53,380
tell me whatever you know tell me about

586
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:55,990
it and then is there quick fixes can we

587
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:59,890
turn something off while we are fixing

588
00:25:55,990 --> 00:26:01,990
something in the long term or is there a

589
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:05,230
quick fix that we you know can pull

590
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:07,059
something out this able to function

591
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:10,090
any quick fix that you can think about

592
00:26:07,059 --> 00:26:12,789
to reduce the risk while we are working

593
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:15,730
on the long-term and sometimes just

594
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:17,379
doing the quick fixes enough sometimes

595
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:20,019
if you tell me it's a specific

596
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:23,200
application that we use and I go through

597
00:26:20,019 --> 00:26:25,149
my data and find less than 2% of my

598
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,639
clients actually use that feature

599
00:26:25,149 --> 00:26:31,449
I might just turn it out for for good

600
00:26:27,639 --> 00:26:33,789
your if it is a software version that is

601
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:36,159
so old only like three of my clients are

602
00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:37,419
on it right now with my current solution

603
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,250
where cloud-based obviously is

604
00:26:37,419 --> 00:26:41,500
everybody's on the same solution but we

605
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:44,889
also have an on-premise solution if it

606
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:46,720
is an old software version I will just

607
00:26:44,889 --> 00:26:48,668
tell those clients they absolutely need

608
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,820
to upgrade otherwise they are known and

609
00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:56,919
I will not invest any any engineering

610
00:26:51,820 --> 00:27:00,519
resources so those are the the topics

611
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:07,059
that that we need to cover when when we

612
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:12,429
talk about vulnerabilities and I already

613
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:15,610
mentioned how how communicating with

614
00:27:12,429 --> 00:27:17,889
each other is an absolute necessity for

615
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:22,529
the business you guys are in charge of

616
00:27:17,889 --> 00:27:25,928
making sure our business is safe our

617
00:27:22,529 --> 00:27:28,929
users or our clients are safe our

618
00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:31,990
clients data is safe in our case of

619
00:27:28,929 --> 00:27:35,019
patients that we don't see but or our

620
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:37,210
customers see or is safe and I'm

621
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:39,760
responsible for making sure our business

622
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:42,159
is profitable right so in order for all

623
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,980
of us to have a job you know we need to

624
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:48,549
work together so that we can we can make

625
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:52,600
sure our business is thriving and as

626
00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:55,060
it's going it's going well and when I

627
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,679
have somebody come to me and say

628
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:59,320
there's a vulnerability I just need it

629
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:01,660
fixed right now and then I do a little

630
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:04,060
bit digging and actually it wasn't all

631
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:05,740
that urgent you does that twice to me

632
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:08,770
after that you lose your credibility

633
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:10,930
that's that's my concern that this has

634
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:12,940
happened before and maybe I made the

635
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:15,550
wrong decision of not fixing it it's

636
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:19,420
possible but I don't trust you anymore

637
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:21,159
so I need everybody I need my product

638
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:22,810
management colleagues to come to you

639
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:25,090
guys and say hey we need to work

640
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:26,710
together and I need to you for you guys

641
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:28,840
to understand a little bit better why

642
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:31,150
you're getting all this pushback so that

643
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:35,740
you can maybe create a little bit better

644
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:37,720
plan as how to talk to us if there are

645
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:39,760
threats to the business it's a threat to

646
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:43,060
the business whether that's data or a

647
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:45,850
competitor or whatever it is if we we

648
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:48,850
need to work together to defend against

649
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:50,800
those threats and and I really want to

650
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:53,949
reduce the number of push backs that

651
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:56,290
you're getting I want as many of those

652
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:58,720
vulnerabilities to be fixed because they

653
00:28:56,290 --> 00:29:01,360
affect everybody right I'm a patient too

654
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,970
so if if I know that a company doesn't

655
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:06,639
care about IT security I don't want my

656
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:08,320
data with them you know we all are we

657
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,500
need to we need to put ourselves a

658
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:14,830
little bit into the those shoes and when

659
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:18,040
you develop your your policies for your

660
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:21,429
IT security we're a pretty big company

661
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:24,909
we're publicly traded and there's often

662
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:27,520
rules from corporate since I only work

663
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:29,950
for one of the divisions and and right

664
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,960
now we have security objectives that

665
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:34,510
object then numbered from one through

666
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:38,140
eight and and now we are on four right

667
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:40,020
now right well I need to understand what

668
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:42,370
that means because number four was

669
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:44,650
monitoring what's going on well that's a

670
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:47,020
good step I guess one through two and

671
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:49,480
three didn't cover that part but number

672
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:52,200
four did well when you start monitoring

673
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:54,059
stuff you will find things

674
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,429
you tell me in advance and we create a

675
00:29:54,059 --> 00:30:00,090
plan together I can put some resources

676
00:29:56,429 --> 00:30:02,250
aside and make sure that when you find

677
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:04,230
something we're not in this panic mode

678
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:06,570
of oh my god we have to be found

679
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:09,360
something you know we need to fix it so

680
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:12,658
we have a plan together and I put let's

681
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:14,939
say 10% even on my resources to the site

682
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:17,190
and make sure their resources that are

683
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:19,529
qualified to fix books that or

684
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:21,990
vulnerabilities that you find then we

685
00:30:19,529 --> 00:30:23,220
can work together so don't leave me out

686
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:24,750
of the loop don't leave your

687
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,880
counterparts out of the loop and then

688
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:29,100
you know when you find something you say

689
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,889
well but we are running this project and

690
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:34,289
we're supposed to why I didn't know

691
00:30:31,889 --> 00:30:39,629
about it so tell me right tell me as

692
00:30:34,289 --> 00:30:42,120
early as you can things usually get

693
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:45,179
worse with agile you know agile and

694
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:47,100
engineering is always this like oh this

695
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:48,659
is so great everything the world is

696
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:51,269
going to be a better place because of

697
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:54,090
agile right it's everybody it's like

698
00:30:51,269 --> 00:30:57,240
hobby right now and my company we have

699
00:30:54,090 --> 00:31:00,168
about a third of the resources working

700
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:03,120
in agile and actually doing continuous

701
00:31:00,169 --> 00:31:05,760
releases of about a third working on

702
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,340
agile but only releasing twice a year

703
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,710
and then we have a third of the teams to

704
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:13,379
work in waterfall so we have all of it

705
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:16,440
so we all talk different languages what

706
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:18,539
gets much worse with agile is it is so

707
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:21,510
easy to interrupt an engineering team

708
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:24,240
right because there's not this huge

709
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:26,940
project that has a deadline that we

710
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,250
defined 18 months ago and it's only like

711
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:31,230
two more months to go we want to do it

712
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:34,350
and we're already a month behind

713
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:37,559
schedule if you now put pushing you know

714
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:40,830
a vulnerability fix or then this will

715
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:44,010
push up for another month in agile you

716
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:47,280
can just secretly like squeeze in some

717
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:49,980
and you know it's just a two-week sprint

718
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:51,690
it's not that big we can do this you

719
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:54,419
also know they meet every morning

720
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:57,450
whatever their time has my team between

721
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:59,309
7:30 and 8 o'clock they all like is

722
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:02,220
standing there like in their little

723
00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:04,350
scrum teams every 15 minutes and the IT

724
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:08,970
security person can just walk over there

725
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:11,189
and say hey AJ you know I found this can

726
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:14,850
you fix this like you know let me know

727
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:17,130
if you have any problems well no we have

728
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:19,580
a plan for those resources that's a huge

729
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:23,700
risk because it's so easy right it

730
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:26,370
almost doesn't impact anybody on the

731
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:29,030
positive side we're nimble right we can

732
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:31,409
switch direction every two weeks we

733
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:34,549
theoretically can switch direction with

734
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:37,470
Sprint but we really really try not to

735
00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:40,379
any other advantages that we can

736
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:43,530
introduce fixes in a continuous release

737
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:47,100
very very quickly so the perceived

738
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:49,410
urgency of having a fix included and

739
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:51,928
being worked on right now partially

740
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:54,059
comes from the fact that it in the past

741
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:57,600
that always took weeks or months to roll

742
00:32:54,059 --> 00:33:00,899
anything out now if you have a solution

743
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:03,090
we can test it on Monday well because we

744
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:05,910
have medical device so we test on

745
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:08,309
Mondays and on Thursdays we release we

746
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:11,250
can push out faster if we need to but

747
00:33:08,309 --> 00:33:14,190
typically that's that's our process so

748
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:15,780
the temptation is always there to like

749
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:18,360
oh let me just do this

750
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:20,760
and then you die by a million of paper

751
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:23,129
cuts right because you put in this one

752
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:25,799
and you put in that one and the same

753
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:27,730
safeguards I'm putting on onto the IT

754
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:29,920
security team to not interrupt

755
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:32,260
my engineers I have to put up the sales

756
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:34,840
team the support team the account

757
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:37,810
managers name them all anybody who talks

758
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:39,639
to customers directly they all want

759
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:42,129
fixes right now

760
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:44,050
Don immediately oh it's just it's just a

761
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:46,630
day or so of work

762
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:48,460
oh yeah theory but it usually is a

763
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:52,390
sprint right and then it's I got to you

764
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:55,450
not just one person and I want to stress

765
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:58,270
even though there's a lot of us and them

766
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:59,980
talk we are all on one team right we're

767
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:03,120
all working together for the same

768
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:05,860
company or we're having the same goal

769
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:08,589
and the goal is the growth in the

770
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:11,469
success of the company it's what we are

771
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:14,170
there to do its what we're there paid to

772
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:16,839
do we might have different perspectives

773
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:18,730
and we might talk slightly differently I

774
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:21,370
mean with a German accent you probably

775
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:23,500
not but other than that we're all like

776
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:26,679
we're in this together I really want us

777
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:28,540
to be more partners than you know us in

778
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:31,690
product management perceiving you guys

779
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:33,820
in IT as being like the intruders and

780
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:36,580
here you're so whiny and you always like

781
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:38,560
have your head cut off and and you know

782
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:41,080
you're running around with whatever next

783
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,480
emergency comes I don't and and we're

784
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:46,299
being the arrogant pricks that just

785
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:49,060
always say no I don't want that I really

786
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:50,590
want us to to come together and work

787
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:54,610
together I think it's really really

788
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:57,060
important for everybody and then we

789
00:34:54,610 --> 00:35:00,400
always have to remember that we're just

790
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:02,410
the safeguards for data that doesn't

791
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,570
actually belong to us in my case in

792
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:07,759
particular the data belongs to a patient

793
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:10,370
the data belongs to a particular family

794
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,950
three kids you know I like that that's

795
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:15,440
what we need to think about so it is

796
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:18,529
important that you voice your concerns

797
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:21,680
because we do have the responsibility to

798
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:24,530
take good care of our clients data we're

799
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:27,049
there to take good care of our our

800
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:30,080
software whatever it is that we are

801
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:33,710
working on so my call to action

802
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:36,049
obviously is is pretty obvious is talk

803
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:37,460
to your product management team and that

804
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,170
might be called something else they

805
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:41,690
might be called solutions like in my

806
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:44,240
case and then whatever they're called

807
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:49,580
it's they're the people that mostly tell

808
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:51,919
you know think about why are they saying

809
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:55,100
no what additional information could

810
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:58,910
they use on me do they need in order to

811
00:35:55,100 --> 00:36:01,850
make the right decision right and then

812
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:05,120
think about it they're just people talk

813
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:07,580
to them and normal I and that's not IT

814
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:10,430
security people but I keep people like I

815
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:12,410
put an IT request because I can't access

816
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:15,290
anybody and the answers well did you try

817
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:19,220
the reset password ring well yeah I did

818
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:21,770
right don't treat me like like I'm I'm

819
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:24,020
some idiot I understand that you guys

820
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:27,050
know much better about whatever it is

821
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:29,600
the expertise you have but I have my

822
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:30,910
expertise as well so treat us as equals

823
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:36,250
and we will

824
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:38,680
he was equals then also as I mentioned

825
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:42,579
before if you already have a plan for

826
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:45,368
for your security system if you have a

827
00:36:42,579 --> 00:36:48,819
plan on how you're executing is involve

828
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:50,950
me early and tell me early that you know

829
00:36:48,819 --> 00:36:52,900
the next three months you're in running

830
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:55,480
this particular project you need you

831
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:58,859
might need resources and I will make

832
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:02,410
make the change to make that available

833
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:04,359
and and that way I can I can build in

834
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:06,519
safeguards and anything that we need to

835
00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:08,410
be doing I can't guarantee that there's

836
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:11,288
enough resources but because they are

837
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:12,788
notoriously short we all know that but I

838
00:37:11,289 --> 00:37:16,869
will do my very best to make sure

839
00:37:12,789 --> 00:37:18,819
everybody has needs that are coming up

840
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:25,329
through want ability testing or whatever

841
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:27,430
will be taken care of and that's that's

842
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:30,789
what I'm summarizing here like make

843
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:34,899
product management your partner you know

844
00:37:30,789 --> 00:37:38,710
work with them help them be be as gentle

845
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:40,930
as you can because we have been hurt

846
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:44,349
before and I'm sure we have hurt you

847
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:47,589
guys so just you know remember which all

848
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:51,880
humans work together and then together

849
00:37:47,589 --> 00:37:59,319
we can absolutely be successful all

850
00:37:51,880 --> 00:38:02,970
right and that was my last slide any

851
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:02,970
questions yes

852
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:11,699
concept videos for you like a video

853
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:13,709
yes anything that I can visualize and

854
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:17,459
then understand helps me because again

855
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:19,319
I'm not I'm not an IT expert yes

856
00:38:17,459 --> 00:38:23,129
absolutely whatever you can find

857
00:38:19,319 --> 00:38:25,259
screenshots points in the in the code

858
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:26,699
even even though I understand that but

859
00:38:25,259 --> 00:38:29,279
the next person I give it to will

860
00:38:26,699 --> 00:38:48,299
understand absolutely anything that you

861
00:38:29,279 --> 00:38:52,140
can they fortunately get filtered out by

862
00:38:48,299 --> 00:38:55,619
mighty security team so they don't reach

863
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:56,848
me directly but I I suspect even though

864
00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:59,279
they don't tell me some of the

865
00:38:56,849 --> 00:39:01,499
vulnerabilities that they escalated to

866
00:38:59,279 --> 00:39:09,630
me are probably coming from sources like

867
00:39:01,499 --> 00:39:11,609
that yeah I send them back I send them

868
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:13,499
back to the IT security team and tell me

869
00:39:11,609 --> 00:39:15,269
if this is credible and if you tell me

870
00:39:13,499 --> 00:39:17,609
it's credible you're the expert

871
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:23,069
then I will leave you and if I find it

872
00:39:17,609 --> 00:39:26,609
on koalas you know rapid7 one of their

873
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:34,519
home pages you know tenable I probably

874
00:39:26,609 --> 00:39:34,519
take it seriously so it makes sense yes

875
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:43,209
mr. researcher

876
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:49,368
serious boring systems in finance

877
00:39:52,540 --> 00:40:00,310
so we you know we don't use a formal

878
00:39:56,290 --> 00:40:02,770
scoring system I make it more dependent

879
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:05,290
on what part of this offering is

880
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:07,900
affected if it is an internal resource

881
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:10,750
or an external resource is a patient

882
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:12,940
data that's affected those are the the

883
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:15,100
you know the categories that I would put

884
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:17,440
it in so as soon as it is a

885
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:19,810
vulnerability that somebody could walk

886
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,310
into somebody else's account on my

887
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:23,710
web-based

888
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:25,779
you know solution that of course as a

889
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:28,390
much higher rating than something that's

890
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:30,070
as I mentioned a printer or you know

891
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:33,430
something internally or like an internal

892
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:39,340
database that we use but I don't I don't

893
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:42,730
unlike with with clinical risks there is

894
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:44,470
a clear scoring there but for for IT

895
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:46,210
vulnerabilities right now we don't have

896
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:49,980
one I I think it would be a great idea

897
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:49,980
though absolutely

898
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:57,450
any other questions

899
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:59,549
or thank you for listening to me thank

900
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:02,578
you again for shell cone for having me

901
00:40:59,549 --> 00:41:04,500
and I guess if you have any questions if

902
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:05,099
you want to contact me my email address

903
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,259
is there

904
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:09,029
I don't do social media except for

905
00:41:07,259 --> 00:41:11,700
LinkedIn so you can reach me through

906
