2011 he was introduced to the privacy

00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,309
cryptocurrency Manero in 2016 and

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:36,030
power-cycle to show cotton 28d thank you

15
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:45,809
hi everybody i'm power-cycle

16
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:50,879
thanks for coming so real quick about me

17
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:53,849
as he said my day job is a network

18
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,218
security engineer so I've worked at a

19
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,559
couple of the big DDoS companies so a

20
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,859
lot of what I do is is analyze network

21
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,259
traffic and and things like that and if

22
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,600
you want you to hold me you can find me

23
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:17,700
on gmail or Twitter or LinkedIn reddit

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:20,699
and fraeno etc as power cycle so Manero

25
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:25,470
is a privacy focused

26
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:28,590
cryptocurrency so the the way that it

27
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:31,798
tries to achieve that privacy is really

28
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:35,220
the three main pillars and four kind of

29
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:38,549
the fourth pillar but three main ways

30
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,408
the one is the ring signatures the ring

31
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:45,329
CT which is ring confidential

32
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:48,570
transactions and stealth addresses so

33
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:49,229
the fourth is Kover E which is a project

34
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,270
within Manero

35
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:53,729
which will kind of give you some extra

36
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,820
privacy so I'll talk about that in a

37
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:55,820
minute

38
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:10,110
so ring signatures anonymize the sender

39
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:12,810
of any transaction and this is one of

40
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:16,020
the key things that makes Monaro very

41
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:21,860
different than bitcoin in bitcoin you

42
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:24,600
have the the owner of a wallet just sign

43
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:27,569
directly to someone's basically their

44
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:31,530
public key their public key equals their

45
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:36,290
address and anyone at any time can see

46
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:40,320
the public key what what manera does is

47
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:42,840
take a ring of signatures sort of like a

48
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:49,260
keyring imagine having six or seven or

49
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:56,130
twenty keys on a keyring so when a when

50
00:02:49,260 --> 00:03:01,500
a when a transaction is certified the

51
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:04,350
keyring itself creates the signature in

52
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,190
that when that image of the keyring is

53
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:09,239
used

54
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:14,489
you can't verifiably ID which of the

55
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:20,549
keys on the ring were used to to verify

56
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:24,600
the transaction so in this way even the

57
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:26,730
the recipient of the transaction can't

58
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:30,239
know because they they know the inputs

59
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:32,820
but they can't even know which of the

60
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,760
the transactions or which of the

61
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:37,950
signings was to them so even though they

62
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:42,030
are encrypted manera takes an additional

63
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:45,060
step to obfuscate the transaction by

64
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:53,220
adding multiple transactions via the

65
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:55,380
ring signatures so ring signatures were

66
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:58,470
were actually much older they were

67
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:07,280
around in 91 and they were basically

68
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:10,379
used by employees who needed access to a

69
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,830
general location but without

70
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:15,760
specifically identify

71
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:17,410
who that person was so this is not

72
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,019
necessarily the guy who's going into the

73
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:23,800
sit down at the missile key system this

74
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:25,930
is who's going to the lunch cafeteria is

75
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,180
someone authorized to be on base are

76
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:31,450
they in the group that can go to the

77
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:34,630
cafeteria or not and they don't really

78
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:36,729
care is the individual valid or not just

79
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,890
are they in the group and in this way

80
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,540
that's the was the original introduction

81
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:43,169
of bring signatures is you have a big

82
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:45,970
group and they were all authorized so

83
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:48,450
what manera does is use that kind of in

84
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:52,450
Reverse by making the entire group fake

85
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:54,670
except for one but by obvious gating at

86
00:04:52,450 --> 00:05:01,630
all it makes it much more harder to to

87
00:04:54,670 --> 00:05:04,570
trace back who the originator was so

88
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:07,210
this is kind of a a graphical

89
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,800
representation of some transactions some

90
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:11,859
Bitcoin transactions would be on the top

91
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,890
and actually one Manero transaction

92
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:17,260
would be on the bottom so at the top

93
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,940
that the original transaction would be

94
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,700
in a block with many other transactions

95
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:24,040
and you might skip ahead to the next

96
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:26,080
block where the previous transaction was

97
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,880
the input for the next then that's the

98
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,969
next input for the next transaction and

99
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,860
at any time if we receive the

100
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:35,860
transaction for the Bitcoin in in

101
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:39,190
transaction five we can tell exactly who

102
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:44,740
transaction transaction one was at least

103
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:46,360
while it was with monaro what you're

104
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,450
doing is you're taking not only your

105
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:52,750
valid transaction but you're taking in

106
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:54,700
that in that in that keyring you're

107
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:57,340
taking UT exo's from previous

108
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:59,680
transactions or transactions that were

109
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:01,390
later than your TXO transaction and

110
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,780
you're committing that one transaction

111
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:06,430
ahead so you're in essence doing

112
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:10,179
multiple transactions when you do one

113
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:12,010
transaction this is the ring in actual

114
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:16,050
you know a visual way to think of the

115
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:18,820
ring signature is how it works so

116
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:21,070
because of this this is also what makes

117
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:23,320
the Monaro blockchain bigger and

118
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:26,170
more quote bloated than other

119
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:30,120
blockchains is by default your adding

120
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:30,120
extra data into every transaction itself

121
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:45,250
so last year last January the the Monaro

122
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,980
protocol was updated to I think it's

123
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:52,960
version 4 of his protocol I think was

124
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:55,990
released in 2014 so previously even

125
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:59,140
though the center receiver were hidden

126
00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:01,750
the transaction amount was still visible

127
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,890
in the blockchain that wasn't partly

128
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,740
obscuring that wasn't part of the

129
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:07,900
original protocol and if you were doing

130
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,670
some blockchain analysis you might be

131
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,340
able to reasonably suspect well if this

132
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:14,260
if this transaction is rather large then

133
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,750
I can probably cut out a rather big

134
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:18,880
subset of wallets that have never

135
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:24,940
received or transactions that have never

136
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:26,230
been at least this amount so the what

137
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:31,990
they started to do was confidential

138
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:33,850
transactions which obscured the amount

139
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:40,150
of data that is in any single

140
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:44,980
transaction so in essence the miner who

141
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:46,539
confirms the block gets to include and

142
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,430
pick and choose which transactions are

143
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:50,830
going in his block when he includes a

144
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:54,880
transaction in a block he confirms that

145
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:56,380
the transaction is valid previously the

146
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,240
inputs and the outputs were totally

147
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:02,680
visible and it was easy to validate what

148
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:04,720
was going on and ring CT which is not to

149
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,150
be confused with ring signatures it's

150
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:12,100
very similar but it is a different

151
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:16,000
implementation so ring CT is how the

152
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:19,150
miner can still validate that the the

153
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,350
amount of inputs is equal to the amount

154
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:26,020
of outputs the the miner organising the

155
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:29,440
block can't see how much any transaction

156
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:31,060
was worth but he can validate via some

157
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,919
some math which on a second that he can

158
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,539
validate that the inputs were equal to

159
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:36,000
the output

160
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:39,270
so this rings signature of this this

161
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,530
this ring confidential transaction is is

162
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:44,819
is kind of doing that so I'll put some

163
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:48,709
math up here and I'll probably gave them

164
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:52,500
more confused as I try to explain it but

165
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:54,540
this is the best way I could I could

166
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:58,470
even go over it so I'll just dive right

167
00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:00,300
into it so since the commitments are

168
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:02,190
additive which means since the the

169
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,290
inputs Sophie effects are additive and

170
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,730
we don't know what that symbol is I

171
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,890
don't even know what that symbol is but

172
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:10,500
we can easily prove that the inputs

173
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:12,870
equal the outputs by observing by making

174
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,330
the sum of the commitments to input in

175
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:18,450
output equal to zero so you have the sum

176
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:22,560
of the commitments of J in so the sum of

177
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:24,990
all the inputs minus the sum of all the

178
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,290
commitments of T out which is all the

179
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:32,060
outputs equal to zero and then to avoid

180
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:35,610
sender identify identify identify

181
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:41,670
ability shin no ether who's one of the

182
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:42,900
Monaro research labs researcher phd's so

183
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:45,360
chin no ether proposed that the

184
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:50,790
commitments sum as a certain non-zero

185
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:53,370
value on zero value so that you take the

186
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,780
sum of the commitments of n input than

187
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:58,020
the sum of the commitments of outputs

188
00:09:54,780 --> 00:10:04,050
and you equal that to a number that's on

189
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:07,920
a graph so below that some of the

190
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:09,900
commitments of the inputs of G is that

191
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,290
that sort of number that sort of it's a

192
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:16,920
number on a graph and it sort of becomes

193
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:21,449
a secret that's passed along in in the

194
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:24,560
transaction to validate the that the

195
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:28,710
transaction is not adding or subtracting

196
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:32,040
numbers so it it would be an attack

197
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:34,770
vector if someone could could propose a

198
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,969
transaction like let's say they do two

199
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:38,990
different transactions but one

200
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:42,630
transaction has a negative number in it

201
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:44,790
it you could make another invalid

202
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:46,560
transaction where it has a really high

203
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:49,650
positive number in it

204
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,900
and the some may turn out to be 0 but

205
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:54,660
the settling of accounts would not be

206
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:57,180
correct so what this does is it

207
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:59,010
eliminates the possibility that anything

208
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:02,160
could be 0 so that it could not be

209
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:05,010
negative or that it could not be

210
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:13,319
anything other than what is the input

211
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:17,310
number so so so that was the second part

212
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:21,960
so the third part is called stealth

213
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:26,579
addresses so this is how when a sender

214
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:28,100
sends to a wallet and this data of who

215
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:31,920
it's to is committed on the blockchain

216
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:34,980
this is how it obscures who the receiver

217
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,199
is so that you can't just do blockchain

218
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,670
analysis and and and see everything

219
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,200
that's going to a wallet you can't see

220
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:41,790
whether it's active you can't see how

221
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,140
much it's going to it and you can't see

222
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:48,599
how much at who is sending to it because

223
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:51,300
automatically every time the sender when

224
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:54,240
when you tell me your wallet address I

225
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:56,339
as the sender use your wallet address in

226
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,830
an algorithm to come up with a one-time

227
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:00,120
address so you don't have to tell them

228
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:02,910
it to me tell it to me it's just

229
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:06,720
automatically generated generated for

230
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:09,300
you and then as I as I commit this

231
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,180
transaction to the blockchain on your

232
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:15,510
receiver side on your wallet side you're

233
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:19,229
checking every transaction with your

234
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:25,710
private key to see if the payment is

235
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:27,900
actually meant for you so the the so

236
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:30,540
that says the season the the sender uses

237
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,130
his receiver key to crypt to

238
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:36,060
cryptographically address the

239
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:38,370
transaction so only only the receiver

240
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:40,770
can can decode it that shouldn't say

241
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:43,640
read it everybody can read it only the

242
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:43,640
receiver can decode it

243
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:49,440
so I also copied this part out because

244
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,900
this is the hard part of the math which

245
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,600
which is actually the interesting part

246
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:58,500
of it but to step through this real

247
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:00,120
quick so Alice generates a random number

248
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:03,330
and calculates the one time public key

249
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,550
so that key the O is what's written on

250
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:08,670
the blockchain so key output equals the

251
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:13,079
hash of the random number of the key of

252
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:15,390
Bob so the the view key of Bob times G

253
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:20,720
which is that that secret on the curve

254
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:20,720
plus the key of Bob again

255
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:26,130
Alice sets K is the address of the

256
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:29,100
payment adds the value of random number

257
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:30,780
on the curve and the transaction of the

258
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,670
data of how much it is and it commits

259
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:35,520
that to the network it gets it gets

260
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:39,180
mined in a block so Bob receives it and

261
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:41,730
he sees the value of the random number

262
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:45,569
of on the curve you see some random

263
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:49,620
number and he sees the key of oh the

264
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:53,820
that that stealth address is that key so

265
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:56,130
then he says well if I plug my key the

266
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:59,520
key of Bob times the random number and

267
00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:03,540
get the random number of the view key of

268
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:06,540
Bob and I can then calculate the the

269
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:09,209
sender key of Bob equals the key - the

270
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:12,180
hash minus the random key times the

271
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:14,070
number then Bob sees that the

272
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,949
transaction that the stealth address is

273
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:19,260
actually his address so he's got to jump

274
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:21,030
through these hoops for every single

275
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,710
transaction in order to come up with

276
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:26,040
that output and see is this transaction

277
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:28,980
to me or not and if it is then he can

278
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:31,140
decode the actual transaction because he

279
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:34,050
sees it to his address he can use his

280
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:36,689
key to then decode it and see how much

281
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:40,079
manera was actually sent to him he now

282
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:41,820
has the batman arrow in his wallet

283
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:46,530
and he can sign it off to someone else

284
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:49,760
in the next transaction so it's this

285
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:53,790
particular formula right here that makes

286
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:56,939
mineiro syncing take so long essentially

287
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:59,040
first off you've got a download the

288
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:02,310
blockchain via peer-to-peer which can

289
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,620
take a while but then even if after you

290
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:06,239
have it you have to check every single

291
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,640
transaction with this math formula

292
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,020
whereas with Bitcoin you just scan it

293
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,240
like you were grepping through a text

294
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:13,310
file and

295
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:19,970
done with but here's here's the actual

296
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:22,219
math you have to do so the the fourth

297
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:26,360
part that I mentioned is is co-vary

298
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:31,490
which is an ITP router implementation

299
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:34,310
built for Manero and by the Monaro

300
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:36,160
community but it's actually a little

301
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:40,719
separate but it's built for Manero

302
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:42,770
initially so the the reason being

303
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,350
anytime you do any sort of

304
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:47,000
cryptocurrency transaction you have to

305
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:49,040
connect to that cryptocurrencies network

306
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,730
that means connecting to a particular

307
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:55,670
port connecting to a particular peer and

308
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:58,310
that data itself is just called metadata

309
00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:02,329
so that we all know after Snowden

310
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:06,349
so it's hypothesized and it's very real

311
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:09,649
that any carrier or any country or

312
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:12,170
someone could simply start blocking pore

313
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:14,450
blocking IPS and making transactions

314
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:16,069
hard to do or identifying transactions

315
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:18,560
and watching them and correlating

316
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:23,959
transactions as they happen

317
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:28,790
I to P is a network layer that sits on

318
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:30,829
top of TCP so it's a lot like tor but it

319
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:32,449
doesn't have any exit nodes so you don't

320
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:35,779
cover come out of ITP you just go

321
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:37,279
directly to something that's there and

322
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:40,010
you also don't have a hierarchy so you

323
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:42,560
don't have entry nodes you don't have

324
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:46,310
exit nodes you don't have distributions

325
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:53,180
or anything every every node is a router

326
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:58,640
and every router is its own node so

327
00:16:53,180 --> 00:17:01,609
here's a nice little graphic that kind

328
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:05,629
of kind of shows Alice over there

329
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:08,959
running an ITP router so let's say she

330
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:13,100
wants to send a transaction down here to

331
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:14,959
the alien with Manero being a

332
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:16,760
distributed cryptocurrency she doesn't

333
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:20,540
actually have to talk to him she just

334
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:24,470
needs to talk to some node that's on the

335
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:27,470
ITV network so what she does is

336
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:30,080
set up an inbound channel and an

337
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:33,110
outbound channel to do to completely

338
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,570
differentiate the traffic so that just

339
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:38,059
in case the note in front of her were

340
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:39,889
spying on her that note couldn't

341
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:41,600
correlate the the packets back and forth

342
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,679
and couldn't decrypt the packets because

343
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:47,209
they don't have both sides of the

344
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:49,190
communication but as as she wants to

345
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:51,530
send data she could send data that could

346
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:55,520
go all the way actually to Rick when

347
00:17:51,530 --> 00:18:00,350
Rick gets it the way I 2p works is it

348
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:02,270
layers packets so Alice would take her

349
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:04,879
original message she would put that in

350
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:07,190
an encrypted packet and address it and

351
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,260
then she would take another peer and

352
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:10,850
then cryptographically it encode that

353
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:14,210
and another and another and kind of like

354
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:16,370
a make a Russian egg doll and then she

355
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:19,220
would take that encrypted doll and give

356
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:21,770
it to the next node that node opens it

357
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:24,230
up sees that it can't read the data

358
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:26,720
it gets key doesn't work on whatever the

359
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:28,909
data is so it gives it it reads who it's

360
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,740
addressed to but he can't see it with

361
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:34,220
the data in US so it simply gives it to

362
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:37,640
the next node that node who it's

363
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:39,380
addressed to opens the doll can't read

364
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,030
what the data is but it can read the

365
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:44,299
header so he gives it to the next node

366
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:47,539
and in this way of doing four or more

367
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:51,158
random bouncing around ping pong around

368
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:54,799
the network it's totally obvious gated

369
00:18:51,159 --> 00:19:00,980
where Alice's original packets came from

370
00:18:54,799 --> 00:19:03,679
and in this way Kover e can handle

371
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:05,630
Manero transactions over the network

372
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,080
giving you an additional layer of

373
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,080
privacy

374
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:17,889
so this was this an example of the

375
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:20,560
Garlic encryption and how it would go

376
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:23,590
through as a as it passes through each

377
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:28,320
router so if the the nodes in between

378
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:33,550
were ABC and D and then e F and G so

379
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:36,460
Alice could encrypt to a to B to C into

380
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:39,790
D and those are the Russian dolls that

381
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:43,000
get made one after another and then they

382
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:52,420
get decoded as they go to Bob by e F G

383
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:54,640
and H so another piece I wanted to touch

384
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:56,830
on real quick was was why it seems like

385
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,220
malware cuz rat hacking conference why

386
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:01,389
seems malware and criminals are are

387
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:04,300
using monaro

388
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:07,960
or exploiting computers and crypto

389
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:11,860
mining or asking for for ransom and

390
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:13,690
mineiro and as I've kind of kono gone

391
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:19,209
over a big reason of that as anonymity

392
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:20,770
is with with manera transactions when

393
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:22,630
they get the money and they want to move

394
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:24,430
the money somewhere else you can't do

395
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:25,960
blockchain analysis to see where they're

396
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:28,060
moving their money to you can't

397
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,130
blacklist a certain address or a certain

398
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:32,379
wallet and you can't can't watch it as

399
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:35,140
it moves through but the second is

400
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:37,720
actually ASIC resistance which is part

401
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,350
of the the ethos of the Monaro privacy

402
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:43,090
community

403
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:46,149
so because manera wants to be

404
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:48,840
decentralized but I should say the

405
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:50,950
Charis manera wants to be private

406
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,600
centralization is a threat to privacy

407
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:57,040
therefore manera wants to be

408
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:58,990
decentralized and Asics by their by

409
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:01,120
their very nature are centralization

410
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:03,760
there there becomes a very few

411
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,040
manufacturers of those manufacturers

412
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,360
like one of them is likely to dominate

413
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:10,270
the market and you have very

414
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,810
centralization on the processing and the

415
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:15,810
networking hash power on the network so

416
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:21,240
back in April the community as a whole

417
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:23,760
decided to change the hashing algorithm

418
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:26,310
so that commodity hardware that is

419
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:29,610
within the reach of normal ordinary

420
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:33,210
users could still be done it could still

421
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:36,979
be run to to distribute and decentralize

422
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:39,780
the actual hashing of the network so

423
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:43,380
this kind of crosses up two things is

424
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:47,610
because monaro can be run on commodity

425
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:51,120
hardware and criminals exploit commodity

426
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:53,969
hardware and Manero is an anonymous

427
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:57,449
cryptocurrency then Manero becomes the

428
00:21:53,970 --> 00:22:02,370
criminals cryptocurrency and for me it's

429
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:04,110
kind of a overlaying use case but but it

430
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:06,060
sort of proves the point of Manero

431
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:08,189
itself manera which has a whole lot of

432
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:12,720
other uses and does it isn't just that

433
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:14,730
but for our our terms and in network

434
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,520
security this is one of the main reasons

435
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:23,310
that you keep seeing mineiro miners pop

436
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:24,510
up in in a lot of investigations so if

437
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:26,639
you like to get more info

438
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:32,490
he's our there's a couple of quick links

439
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:35,100
get Manero to work covert io and get

440
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:37,920
manera org library slash zero tumor

441
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:39,990
narrow one no one - PDF that's where I

442
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:43,140
got the formulas especially out of this

443
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:46,410
so thank you very much and if you have

444
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:54,130
any questions please come find me

445
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:54,130
[Applause]

446
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:11,000
just one comment it sits on TCP and UDP

447
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:38,500
okay I'm glad you asked me that sure

448
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:42,100
sure so why ITP over tor and I would

449
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:43,720
like to direct that question or should I

450
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,370
not direct the question okay I'd like to

451
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,350
direct that question to the guy who who

452
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:50,739
who knows something about covert more

453
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:54,519
than I do okay

454
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:58,539
the the the general response is that tor

455
00:23:54,519 --> 00:24:02,110
is not considered secure is is that it's

456
00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:10,120
it's a different layer and that its

457
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:14,918
hierarchy hierarchy invites footholds

458
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:16,029
for doing bad things and there's a lot

459
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:18,130
of rumors one way or the other

460
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:20,620
speculations about you know who's

461
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:23,080
running it one way who's running it or

462
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:25,570
who's funding it or how anonymous it is

463
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:29,260
how not anonymous it is how he can how

464
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:31,658
you can figure out people with even just

465
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:34,960
a few exit nodes you start to pick up

466
00:24:31,659 --> 00:24:40,029
random sort of traffic that you know you

467
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:41,769
can put together and I 2p4 for me other

468
00:24:40,029 --> 00:24:43,960
than the encryption that you put into it

469
00:24:41,769 --> 00:24:48,519
sort of the idea that you don't exit out

470
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:51,490
of that network is a simple security

471
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:53,440
measure that that you know makes it a

472
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:58,980
one less hop that you can be identified

473
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,980
on but I'd like to hear what he says

474
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:04,889
no space time no space time no but

475
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:06,810
essentially it's not decentralized the

476
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:09,590
consensus most discriminatory if you

477
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:09,590
have big wads of cash

478
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:17,120
okay so it's not that's not PGP

479
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:21,949
essentially you're just leeching off

480
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:24,459
big cash for life and real ace see him

481
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:24,460
actually the

482
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:27,919
there's so much more

483
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:33,700
if something goes standard is

484
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:49,080
I sent a message recently

485
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:08,989
[Applause]
