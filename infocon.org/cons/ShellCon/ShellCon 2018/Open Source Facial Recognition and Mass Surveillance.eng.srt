1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,840
and okay this is open source pickle

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,210
facial recognition and mass surveillance

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,619
with Ian O'Neill Ian is a writer of

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,000
hacking tutorials with an interest in

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,929
surveillance counter-surveillance and

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,840
making memes with machine learning

7
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:14,840
please welcome me into shell con 2018

8
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:21,960
all right my research doing facial

9
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:24,119
recognition machine learning and it's

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,029
specifically mass surveillance was

11
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:28,470
eventually me trying to investigate how

12
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:29,759
easy it is to do the sorts of things

13
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,710
that we're now seeing on the nation

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,719
state level for security and kind of the

15
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,550
goods and Bad's of that so even with

16
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,620
those kind of ethical issues aside I

17
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,989
wanted to learn how is this done and

18
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,579
more specifically how can we break it so

19
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:43,379
to begin I'd like to take a look at just

20
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,820
a few of the current implementations

21
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:47,280
ways that facial recognition is being

22
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:50,730
used first for private business security

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,949
systems things like security cameras for

24
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,410
companies one is provided by Panasonic

25
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:56,789
it has a lot of features which are

26
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,620
relatively useful for that sort of thing

27
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:59,899
it's primarily to track people who go

28
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,180
into a single business or office

29
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:04,769
multiple times and kind of monitor that

30
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,180
sort of thing for security purposes so

31
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,070
if there's any incident that can kind of

32
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,689
be traced back and identified these

33
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,770
aren't really designed to scale they're

34
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:12,779
not really designed to work with

35
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,970
existing infrastructure or hardware like

36
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,070
web cameras and even though it's simple

37
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,140
it requires purchasing the entire

38
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:22,020
infrastructure meaning cameras using

39
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,430
that software and kind of working out

40
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,839
the issues of storage and data

41
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,170
portability which you don't have control

42
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,729
over since it's closed source in other

43
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,430
implementations we've seen a lot in the

44
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:34,590
news about such places such as China

45
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,420
where facial recognition has been used

46
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,549
as visibly as people being caught

47
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,130
jaywalking having their face shown on a

48
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:43,290
camera at the intersection and then

49
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,670
having to find mailed to them even

50
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,810
though this is somewhat far away it's

51
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,790
not to say that the sort of the same

52
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,640
sort of thing isn't going on the u.s. in

53
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,979
the u.s. we have the homeland advance

54
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,320
recognition technology database which

55
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,810
looks for things like the face physical

56
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,298
descriptors potentially voice data and

57
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,850
as many as 500 million people this isn't

58
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,619
really specific enough because we simply

59
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,128
can't get that data as to what this

60
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:09,568
actually contains or who it contains

61
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:12,900
other services like recognition made by

62
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:16,079
Amazon or sold local police departments

63
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,849
and even here in Los Angeles the LAPD

64
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,810
uses a piece of software made by

65
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:23,760
Palantir which has had some interesting

66
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,319
implications well it's completely

67
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,929
proprietary and we can't really say what

68
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:29,609
it does there have been researched there

69
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,250
has been research done suggest as the

70
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,900
quote says here that 2% of residents who

71
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,909
responded to the survey report being

72
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,269
stopped by police between 11 and 30

73
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:41,730
times a week or more while 76% respond

74
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:44,280
and reported never being stopped at all

75
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,798
so that's mean a very small percentage

76
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,390
of people are being stopped very

77
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:50,879
frequently because of these machine

78
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:53,220
learning algorithms which are trained on

79
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,170
potentially biased data so machines

80
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,670
aren't biased but biased training data

81
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:00,059
being applied to real-world situations

82
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:02,819
can be very dangerous and to kind of

83
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,579
emphasize this currently the DHS has a

84
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:08,578
biometric database containing around 125

85
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:11,220
million biometric records 2% of the

86
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:14,819
world's population and expects

87
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:16,829
substantial growth in that database so

88
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:18,660
in order to kind of understand how these

89
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:20,040
systems are being used and how we can

90
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,989
protect ourselves against them or

91
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,970
implement them we can go through a

92
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:25,769
little bit on how they actually work the

93
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,769
first step of facial recognition is

94
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:30,180
detecting faces this is a completely

95
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:32,489
separate process than some of the other

96
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,169
sorts of things for recognition in fact

97
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:35,549
facial recognition uses about three

98
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:36,989
different neural networks to do

99
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:39,959
different functions at different time

100
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:42,540
times so there are a few different ways

101
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,549
to do facial detection one issue in this

102
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,620
specific part of facial recognition is

103
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:48,540
speed one of the things would solve this

104
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,239
was the Viola Jones object detection

105
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:53,310
framework this used little boxes of high

106
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,480
contrast areas overlaid them to look for

107
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,459
shapes this is something that you see

108
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,948
commonly on something like this screen

109
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,810
shown here on a digital camera or phone

110
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:02,519
where faces are being identified now

111
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:05,040
this is a very rough way to approximate

112
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,269
faces and as such that's law the reason

113
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,828
where if you've ever used a digital

114
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:09,599
camera seen the screenshots where it's

115
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:11,069
like oh is there a ghost in this corner

116
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,018
why is it finding a face in the dark

117
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:15,149
it's just kind of a level of contrast

118
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:17,699
now what's being used in modern systems

119
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,949
is a different technique so some

120
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:23,280
previous research on evading facial

121
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:25,560
recognition were these styles which were

122
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,659
done by Adam Harvey of CV

123
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,820
ghazal these looked for these high

124
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,320
contrast levels that the viola jones

125
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,719
object detection framework looked for

126
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,820
and placed kind of spoofing agents

127
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,770
within the face in order to overcome

128
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:41,250
these what's interesting is even looking

129
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:43,409
how extreme these styles are they do not

130
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,200
work against the current systems the

131
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:48,180
modern way being used to do facial

132
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,669
detection is histogram of oriented

133
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,950
gradients this takes a black and white

134
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:55,710
image it looks for levels of contrast

135
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:58,889
and kind of creates almost pixel like

136
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:01,859
units of percentage of contrast and

137
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:03,780
increase so it takes things like a nose

138
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,490
being brighter than the corners behind

139
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,049
it and turns this into something where

140
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:09,720
it can be measured numerically and

141
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:12,240
compared to things which are known faces

142
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,410
this is effective even against this sort

143
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,690
of style because it can still identify

144
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:20,190
those core facial features so the next

145
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:21,300
step which actually is more important

146
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:24,180
when it comes to doing facial rec

147
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,970
recognition is landmark estimation once

148
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,320
the face is isolated in a picture it you

149
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,880
need to be able to actually numerically

150
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,219
compare it to other faces in order to

151
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,659
identify them one example of this is

152
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,370
deal obscene which has a facial

153
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,140
recognition library which looks for 68

154
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,600
points which can be roughly approximated

155
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,610
on any given face some models look for

156
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,440
as many as 194 which is more accurate

157
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:46,560
but of course requires high-resolution

158
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,180
data as well models define individual

159
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,800
points or landmarks these are assumed to

160
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,030
exist on all and once you have those

161
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,280
points you can measure the distance

162
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:55,710
between them the actual math behind this

163
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,469
is much beyond my level of understanding

164
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:01,830
I've linked a paper on it in the bottom

165
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:04,560
there one millisecond face alignment

166
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:06,090
with an ensemble of regression trees I

167
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,340
have a link to that paper in the last

168
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:10,289
slide here I can honestly say I don't

169
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,570
understand it but I'd like to emphasize

170
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:14,460
that in not understanding any of these

171
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:16,440
low-level mathematical operations going

172
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,880
on machine learning I was able to build

173
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,950
a perfectly functional facial

174
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,560
recognition system that could do mass

175
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:24,900
surveillance like behaviors in just a

176
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,720
few hundred levels of hundred lines of

177
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:30,929
high-level code so once these landmarks

178
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,090
are detected they're centered and kind

179
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,960
of made so that either a person turning

180
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,179
their face or a person with an

181
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,580
asymmetrical face would not have that

182
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,420
counter it out so rather than

183
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,669
necessarily look

184
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:43,530
four phases specific angle the points

185
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:46,200
are referenced and scaled in order to

186
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:48,599
average them so people faces at

187
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,280
different angles or with partially

188
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,280
covered faces could still be positively

189
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:57,030
identified some examples of these

190
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:59,039
different facial landmark estimation

191
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:01,200
examples are shown here in these images

192
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,690
you can see the upper-left is how it

193
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,240
should actually behave the right is

194
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:08,400
shows a partial issue with obfuscation

195
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,070
but even though you can see that the

196
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,109
left eye in that image is slightly off

197
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:14,880
because of the way that the averages are

198
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,650
done and ordered estimate them you can

199
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,330
still actually make positive

200
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:20,280
identification and that face is a

201
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,630
sufficient amount of detail to do

202
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,190
recognition against thousands or

203
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:27,510
potentially hundreds thousands other

204
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:30,030
faces as goes for the lower left metal

205
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:32,010
style corpse paint is not usually enough

206
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:33,719
because it doesn't really violate the

207
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,310
substantial features which you'd need to

208
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,010
change in order to overcome facial

209
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:39,810
recognition most amusingly at the lower

210
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:42,420
right I found that Juggalo face paint

211
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:45,690
does in fact often overcome this because

212
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:47,880
the places of the jawline and specific

213
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:50,580
are completely redefined that high level

214
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,680
of contrast even though the features the

215
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,260
core features such as the nose eyes and

216
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,070
mouth are able to be identified

217
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,810
accurately since those are very

218
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,610
difficult to move without completely

219
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,740
obscuring them the jawline was almost

220
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:03,990
completely spoofed with the high level

221
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,000
of contrast there something which was

222
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:07,800
found to be very amusing by news

223
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,360
agencies I would have wished they

224
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,860
focused a little bit on the ethical

225
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,000
implementations of facial recognition

226
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:17,450
but it was funny I was entertained

227
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,850
in other examples some severe

228
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:22,229
obfuscation techniques I've seen

229
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:24,060
suggested online really don't do

230
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:27,960
anything even though these are drawn on

231
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:30,000
a secondary level of eyes because the

232
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,520
algorithms have such predefined

233
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,039
distances between different points this

234
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:37,978
doesn't overcome facial recognition nor

235
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,169
does things like this as interesting as

236
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:42,240
they look the landmarks and still be

237
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:43,650
placed very well what I would like to

238
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,270
emphasize though for overcoming facial

239
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:47,760
recognition with this and as an example

240
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:50,189
is that you can see the mouth is

241
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,630
slightly changed in shape and this is

242
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,950
something I've found to be more accurate

243
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:55,050
with modern facial recognition

244
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,940
techniques rather than trying to

245
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,160
completely hide or redefine features

246
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:01,530
trying to expand them or kind of

247
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,939
transform them while maintain existing

248
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:06,000
lines of your face is somewhat more

249
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:08,070
effective so training a neural network

250
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,630
to do a facial recognition is one of the

251
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,370
most important parts because you need to

252
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:13,439
be able to figure out what faces look

253
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:14,790
like compare them to other faces and

254
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,400
this is something that you can't really

255
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:19,170
manage with traditional algorithms

256
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,420
luckily these models are pretty much

257
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:24,180
fully developed and existing and open

258
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:26,370
source so training a deep convolutional

259
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,989
neural network to generate these 128

260
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:31,080
measurements between the previously

261
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:32,670
found 68 points allows us to have a set

262
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,790
of data which we can compare numerically

263
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:37,770
to other faces to make a match the

264
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:40,290
training process is something which also

265
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,579
takes a lot of time or power but because

266
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,170
of the way that machine learning works

267
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,750
you can have a pre trained model and

268
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:47,550
really not have to use any computing

269
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:50,250
power and just take that data which is

270
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:52,859
already existing what I use for my

271
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,630
personal project was a face underscore

272
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,600
recognition which is a library for

273
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:58,939
Python which is kind of a wrapper for

274
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,780
Addie lips

275
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:04,740
does the actual detection placement of

276
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:08,400
points as well as taking those

277
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:10,530
measurements so one thing which is

278
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,030
interesting when coming from kind of

279
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,740
traditional data management structures

280
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:17,130
how do you actually deal with biometric

281
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,510
data now normally with data you'd have

282
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,740
something like an index if something is

283
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,300
going into a database you can order

284
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,980
alphabetically you can order it by its

285
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,199
number its size a lot of things like

286
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:28,080
that when you're comparing faces in a

287
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,850
database you have 128 different

288
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:34,260
measurements that you can't simply take

289
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:36,090
one as the index this is among some of

290
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:38,100
the other issues that we've seen with

291
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:39,900
managing all the metadata that comes

292
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,980
from when you're taking in different

293
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:44,130
cameras and different sources

294
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:45,800
correlating people gathering new faces

295
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:48,420
making sure that there aren't collisions

296
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,829
dealing with biometric data is something

297
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,150
that's still very new and something that

298
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,950
even many government surveillance

299
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:55,050
systems have kind of had documented

300
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:56,580
issues regarding one thing that's

301
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:59,280
interesting though is that because of

302
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:01,110
social media the publicly placed cameras

303
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,480
which are altogether common now you

304
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:05,370
don't need to fully construct a new

305
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,510
facial recognition system or database to

306
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,640
be able to still monitor peep

307
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:13,439
effectively one way that this was shown

308
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:16,920
that in Russia decayed ru or V contact I

309
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,720
had basically a lack of limiting or rate

310
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,120
limiting on requesting profile pictures

311
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,070
so this company fine face basically

312
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,310
requested every single profile picture

313
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:28,080
and URL for every user on VK then they

314
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,489
trained that they trained a facial

315
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,570
recognition model on that and now they

316
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,550
have a website where you can take a

317
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:34,260
picture of someone and look them up and

318
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:38,099
find their social media just with their

319
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:40,319
face interestingly because this actual

320
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,210
secondary kind of metadata of facial

321
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,120
recognition data isn't taking pictures

322
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:47,220
of people it's taking measurements there

323
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,520
is a lot less regulation on how this is

324
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,020
actually even legal like storing facial

325
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,670
recognition data is not regulated

326
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,410
whatsoever even though taking pictures

327
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:57,240
of people can be in certain contexts

328
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:58,709
facial recognition data specifically

329
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,480
those measurements which could be used

330
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:02,340
to identify people is very much metadata

331
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,400
which is not being managed or regulated

332
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:07,230
in any way and additionally I'm sure

333
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,689
some of us in the room are familiar with

334
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:12,090
showdown the availability of webcams and

335
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:14,880
cameras that are either weakly secured

336
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:17,880
or completely open kind of means that

337
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,680
you can take existing Hardware develop

338
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,960
new firmware for it or manage those

339
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,579
feeds to create a kind of a secondary

340
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:26,250
almost like secret sneakernet

341
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:29,850
facial recognition system of just open

342
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:31,920
source data so this data farming of

343
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:34,590
things which could be used for marketing

344
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,689
one example might be someone taking a

345
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:39,180
facial recognition scanner outside of

346
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:41,430
like a hospital or something like that

347
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:43,800
and selling that data to insurance

348
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:45,540
companies as of right now that wouldn't

349
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,160
necessarily be illegal because it's not

350
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:49,079
taking photos and it's not even

351
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,750
necessarily tying the name to that data

352
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:54,990
and because of that nobody can even say

353
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:57,320
if that's currently being done so

354
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:59,880
managing this facial recognition data is

355
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,650
very different to managing usual data

356
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:05,340
but a lot of same systems can still be

357
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:08,189
used in my case I used PostgreSQL same

358
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:09,600
as any other SQL syntax more or less but

359
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,880
I had to do some special tricks to

360
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,490
manage that data rather than comparing

361
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,930
images one by one determinate the image

362
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:19,020
of a match we have this pre computed

363
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:20,498
version which is these 128 measurements

364
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,239
this set was generated by the

365
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:24,099
neural network we can format a way where

366
00:13:22,239 --> 00:13:26,229
each of these are set as dimensions

367
00:13:24,099 --> 00:13:29,259
which can be individually sorted in our

368
00:13:26,229 --> 00:13:30,879
database so the formula we do that with

369
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:33,429
is Euclidean distance because rather

370
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:35,019
than normal kind of database storage

371
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:36,608
where you have a single index and it's

372
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:38,679
just is this something larger smaller

373
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:40,569
higher number lower enough number you

374
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:42,098
need to be able to manage those 128

375
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:45,429
dimensions in multi dimensional shape

376
00:13:42,099 --> 00:13:48,069
you what you want is the average of how

377
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:50,619
similar those 128 dimensions are to

378
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:51,998
another set of 128 dimensions that's

379
00:13:50,619 --> 00:13:53,499
very different to normal database

380
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,359
management but it is something that can

381
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:58,599
be handled by the existing technology in

382
00:13:55,359 --> 00:14:00,639
my case I use post grace which had a

383
00:13:58,599 --> 00:14:02,859
cube function this was previously being

384
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,049
limited to a hundred dimensions however

385
00:14:02,859 --> 00:14:07,629
by custom by compiling post grace

386
00:14:05,049 --> 00:14:10,689
yourself you can change a single line in

387
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:12,549
cube data H to change it to 128

388
00:14:10,689 --> 00:14:14,618
dimensions and then from there I was

389
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:16,598
able to sort these kind of as what it

390
00:14:14,619 --> 00:14:19,299
treated as multi-dimensional cubes

391
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:20,979
meaning this 128 dimensions in multiple

392
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:23,348
space could be indexed and the

393
00:14:20,979 --> 00:14:25,919
similarity could be compared numerically

394
00:14:23,349 --> 00:14:28,419
just using an existing database system

395
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:30,279
so the sort that I actually used to do

396
00:14:28,419 --> 00:14:32,769
that is pretty much regular SQL syntax

397
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:34,899
order by face encoding and then the

398
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:38,439
distance being the cube array which

399
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:40,769
includes the face encoding to reference

400
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:43,509
kind of how this data actually scales

401
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:46,509
each entry is around four kilobytes very

402
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:49,299
small meaning every 250,000 entries is

403
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:51,099
around 1 gigabyte at that rate the

404
00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:54,039
entire world population could be in less

405
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:56,739
than 30 terabytes and practically anyone

406
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:59,470
within that could be recognized with

407
00:14:56,739 --> 00:15:00,999
high quality photos at consistent angles

408
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,859
I haven't managed to create any

409
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:04,869
collision as to where two people were

410
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:07,299
actually being matched as the same even

411
00:15:04,869 --> 00:15:08,859
using data like twins and I honestly

412
00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:10,509
found that the facial recognition

413
00:15:08,859 --> 00:15:13,209
software was better at differentiating

414
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:15,459
twins than I was so there's a lot of

415
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:17,079
kind of like well how we'll be able to

416
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:18,339
scale this won't people aren't there too

417
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:20,348
many people who look the same and the

418
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:23,109
fact is facial recognition data has

419
00:15:20,349 --> 00:15:25,029
enough detail to differentiate a

420
00:15:23,109 --> 00:15:27,989
practically infinite amount of people as

421
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:31,059
of with the current world population

422
00:15:27,989 --> 00:15:32,949
tested to around 50,000 entries in the

423
00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:33,730
test database it retrieves results

424
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:35,170
consistent

425
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:37,540
in less than a second on regular

426
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:39,519
computer hardware meaning it's not

427
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:41,680
really difficult to build a facial

428
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:45,490
recognition system and it's not an issue

429
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,989
of hardware speed so how would you

430
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,519
actually go about deploying an

431
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:50,709
open-source facial recognition or mass

432
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:52,420
surveillance system in my case I was

433
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:54,969
using totally open source software with

434
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:57,339
a pretty reasonable sack I'd have

435
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:59,860
something like a camera or maybe a

436
00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:02,980
crawler looking on social media it would

437
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:04,300
send that to Python where I wasn't had a

438
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,500
little script running which would map

439
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,670
those facial coordinates do the

440
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,320
detections all the things which I

441
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:10,719
mentioned in the initial facial

442
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,329
recognition steps see if any faces are

443
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,100
there if not it skips and then it checks

444
00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:17,260
if there is a face found it compares any

445
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:19,420
faces in a given image video or so on to

446
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:21,010
the database if it's found a new entry

447
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,810
is added as well as metadata so where

448
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:25,540
that's coming from be it social media or

449
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:27,069
a camera and if no match is found that

450
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,230
adds a new entry as well as that

451
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:31,630
metadata this is all being implemented

452
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:33,699
which is Python post grace basic SQL

453
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:36,220
high-level programming languages in

454
00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:39,040
probably less than a few hundred lines

455
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:41,350
of code which is not difficult at all

456
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,180
this was a project that with very

457
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:45,670
limited experience programming and I was

458
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:48,279
able to finish in less than a month

459
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:49,959
which makes you think that if I can

460
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:53,380
create a functional mass surveillance

461
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:55,359
system in practically a couple weeks

462
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:57,040
that companies are surely doing this

463
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,139
governments we know are doing this and

464
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,029
more likely more people are doing the

465
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:03,130
sort of surveillance that we aren't

466
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:06,790
noticing because there is no regulation

467
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:08,140
on it whatsoever so I used face

468
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:12,879
underscore recognition for the facial

469
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:14,679
recognition size CEO PG two for the

470
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,589
database requests and then I crawler for

471
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:20,199
web crawling these are all very simple

472
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:21,698
fun Python libraries so even though

473
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:24,819
facial recognition can seem really

474
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:26,770
daunting the main shift to make is how

475
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:29,168
you treat data and how you look at data

476
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:32,230
gathering it's very similar to any other

477
00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:34,630
sort of data based programming or

478
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:36,970
development but in working in multiple

479
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:38,320
dimensions and working with techniques

480
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:40,780
that you haven't necessarily seen used

481
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,340
before in the same sense though all of

482
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,629
these things are completely available

483
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,340
and developed even though facial

484
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,690
recognition seems like the same thing I

485
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,639
see when I look at

486
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,109
the research papers where it's just a

487
00:17:48,639 --> 00:17:52,209
bunch of math that I definitely can't

488
00:17:50,109 --> 00:17:55,779
understand you really don't have to work

489
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:57,999
with that now and that kind of to some

490
00:17:55,779 --> 00:18:00,159
point scares me in how easy this

491
00:17:57,999 --> 00:18:02,139
actually is to do but it's also very

492
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:03,879
interesting because I'm sure that we're

493
00:18:02,139 --> 00:18:06,158
going to see a lot more of this being

494
00:18:03,879 --> 00:18:08,289
used and potentially more publicly in

495
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:11,049
the future I'd like to conclude with a

496
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:13,720
few references the first one is a very

497
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:15,820
good tutorial which provides most of the

498
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,190
information you need to implement facial

499
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,658
recognition using python euclidean

500
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:21,549
distance and n-dimensional space which

501
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:24,789
goes through some of the issues and

502
00:18:21,549 --> 00:18:26,259
functions of having multidimensional

503
00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:28,389
data being mandersohn database system

504
00:18:26,259 --> 00:18:32,169
and then finally a paper which kind of

505
00:18:28,389 --> 00:18:42,248
explains the landmark placement of

506
00:18:32,169 --> 00:18:44,950
facial recognition so that's about it if

507
00:18:42,249 --> 00:18:57,190
I have time can I do questions any

508
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:58,629
questions no I have no I've written the

509
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:00,609
crawlers and I've tested them to be

510
00:18:58,629 --> 00:19:01,988
around three entries which I owned as a

511
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:03,849
test thing it was just one of those

512
00:19:01,989 --> 00:19:05,889
things where it's like hey theoretically

513
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:09,009
this is not regular at all I don't want

514
00:19:05,889 --> 00:19:11,939
to do it so have you have you considered

515
00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:14,840
like the challenges of scaling back

516
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:17,180
pictures of their face

517
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,830
it's social media and that's cute your

518
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:21,110
data so I mean in general it would just

519
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:22,340
discard that face so like let's say like

520
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:24,290
the training model for Colleen that

521
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:26,149
would be it would look through profiles

522
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:27,620
if there is a high quality enough face

523
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,880
that it matches that what's more

524
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,860
difficult I've found is when there are

525
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,450
other people's faces whereas like

526
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,919
pictures of friends or so on what I've

527
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:36,230
tried to do a little bit with that is

528
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,910
base is focused on Instagram where I

529
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:40,160
would look through kind of a set of

530
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:42,500
photos find the faces which is a kind of

531
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,210
low computational power process like

532
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,920
let's say just only include their photos

533
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:48,380
with faces and include the face that's

534
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:50,480
most commonly seen which isn't

535
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:52,220
necessarily effective but you can also

536
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,110
kind of emphasize that in the data or

537
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:56,650
like mark that metadata to say this

538
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,649
might not be right

539
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:10,580
my wife this woman keeps Chinese family

540
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:12,559
photos all his business and she man you

541
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,689
know several years ago really started to

542
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:17,120
like this thing I guess Apple that

543
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:19,760
iPhoto password tags are good even I

544
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,340
thought it was always failed to see

545
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,900
bushy my brother died and I've always

546
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,189
thought that makes sense that it has

547
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:28,970
trouble with it because that's like this

548
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:35,960
kind of educates so I was surprised you

549
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:38,000
say that I think the main issue that

550
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,130
kind of those like high detail levels of

551
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,170
recognition thing are the quality of the

552
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:44,300
photo and the size of the database and

553
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:46,070
the threshold of that match so let's say

554
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,840
like my conditions for reference were

555
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:49,120
like kind of perfect conditions this was

556
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:53,840
like a photo which was at least maybe

557
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:55,879
1200 pixels roughly high with just kind

558
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,370
of a closed crop of the face same angle

559
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,559
same exact thing and with that you can

560
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:02,570
have kind of increasing detail of how

561
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,639
accurately those landmarks replace and

562
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:07,370
the threshold of how they're compared so

563
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,890
to emphasize that for twins I would say

564
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:12,409
it's extremely effective in high detail

565
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:13,820
situations but that goes for general

566
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:15,890
facial recognition to a low resolution

567
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:19,280
photo just a photo where the face is

568
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:21,950
obscured what you need to do to at least

569
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,809
have an effective scale database is take

570
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:25,760
those and say oh this is either to call

571
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:27,920
this is to low quality I won't add it or

572
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,840
I'll mark this as low quality and treat

573
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,580
it with less weight so there's a lot of

574
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,399
waiting and kind of evaluation you have

575
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:36,230
to do because no no match that isn't the

576
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,960
exact same photo is going to ever have

577
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:40,309
100% accuracy and that's kind of one of

578
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,110
the issues that you can have to jump to

579
00:21:40,309 --> 00:21:44,360
when switching from regular programming

580
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:47,000
it's not going to be one equals one on a

581
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,678
match so you have to set a threshold and

582
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,130
determine what's acceptable based on the

583
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:51,130
conditions

584
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,550
or at least you need to have

585
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:00,320
automatically implemented things like

586
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:02,629
checking the photo resolution the size

587
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,970
of the photo as it happens and either

588
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:14,840
being able to discard those or treat

589
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:17,030
them as lesser data I mean it can be

590
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,909
fairly low I would say maybe a photo

591
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:21,740
that's 200 by 200 pickled pixels that's

592
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:23,450
like a closed crop of the face it

593
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:26,090
doesn't need an exceptional level of

594
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:27,620
detail if it's a good photo but there

595
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:29,000
are definitely like a lot of security

596
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:31,419
camera footage is not high enough

597
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,420
quality

598
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:43,000
human space do you consider other

599
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,000
sources of

600
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,340
in public aggregation like this

601
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,810
absolutely social media is kind of the

602
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,370
most broadly use that's why was focused

603
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:57,770
on but I've also done some research on

604
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:59,479
using dating app API is where a lot of

605
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:01,100
people have very personal information

606
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,720
personal connections and things like

607
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:05,120
that going in as well as things which

608
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,910
could be used to kind of be dangerous in

609
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,159
certain places so there's a lot of data

610
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:11,300
that's publicly available and people are

611
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,430
willing to put out there because they

612
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:15,830
think it can't be correlated to them but

613
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:17,120
if they have a face on that profile they

614
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,899
there's kind of a point now where you

615
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,949
have to realize that that's not

616
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,020
necessarily the case

617
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:22,880
even if something online isn't

618
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:25,129
associated to your name or you in any

619
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,170
way as soon as these facial recognition

620
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:28,760
pieces of information are actually being

621
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:31,400
indexed that can be tied back to you

622
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,260
which is interesting and mostly

623
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,610
dangerous because I really have

624
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:48,740
difficulty thinking of situations where

625
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:51,169
that's good losing weight is only

626
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:53,600
relevant on kind of the extreme end and

627
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:55,670
aging tends not to affect it one thing

628
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,070
that can be done is depending on the

629
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:59,270
level of quality of data this goes for

630
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,770
things too where it's like let's say

631
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,510
concealing like the lower half of a face

632
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:04,280
with a mask or something you can focus

633
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:05,330
on specifically the eyes you can focus

634
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,940
on kind of things which won't change

635
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:10,720
being like the mouth eyes nose relative

636
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:12,890
positions whereas generally with age and

637
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,010
weight change it's just kind of a change

638
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:17,510
in the jawline so in general I haven't

639
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:20,030
seen it enough to be over the thresholds

640
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:21,650
for most matches there are some extreme

641
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:24,820
cases where it has but those can also be

642
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:24,820
kind of countered against

643
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:39,289
is there a good way of an like wearing a

644
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:40,908
Juggalo part-1 thing with let's say the

645
00:24:39,289 --> 00:24:42,559
Juggalo face pain in general all the

646
00:24:40,909 --> 00:24:44,240
facial features are still there and it's

647
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,830
kind of tricky in the automatic

648
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,110
detection let's say you had somebody

649
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:49,250
manually placed the 68 points that

650
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:52,129
makeup wouldn't be enough

651
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:53,450
really the only ways that I've seen so

652
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:55,789
far to actually overcome facial

653
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:58,039
recognition also kind of overcome human

654
00:24:55,789 --> 00:25:00,230
recognition I know that that's that's a

655
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:01,370
funny reference point but like if you're

656
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:03,019
wearing a mask

657
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:05,120
other people you know might not be able

658
00:25:03,019 --> 00:25:07,730
to recognize you immediately either so

659
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,469
anything where you're both recognizable

660
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:12,080
to people you know but actually over the

661
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:13,730
threshold of a match I have not seen it

662
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,500
and that's something I've been working

663
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:17,500
on trying to find and have not seen

664
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:34,389
yes definitely I mean I mean that's kind

665
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,799
of like the traditional surveillance

666
00:25:34,389 --> 00:25:37,719
system thing kind of like what you see

667
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:39,879
in China where it's like body cameras

668
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,169
and publicly placed things I've worked

669
00:25:39,879 --> 00:25:44,139
on that a little bit there's a lot of

670
00:25:41,169 --> 00:25:56,230
issues of quality with it but it's

671
00:25:44,139 --> 00:25:58,209
definitely going to develop I think when

672
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:59,500
you work with video you take a still so

673
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:00,669
what you might be running is the first

674
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,990
thing where it's looking for a histogram

675
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:04,090
of gradients there's kind of identify

676
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:05,799
faces and when there's a face it takes a

677
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:08,649
still and then determines if that's high

678
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:18,580
enough resolution to map the face and

679
00:26:08,649 --> 00:26:21,610
use it for recognition data as much as I

680
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:23,168
I hate the idea of applying block chain

681
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:25,479
technology this it just seems like two

682
00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:29,259
terrible things being combined into

683
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:30,549
something worse I do think that it lets

684
00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:32,169
say if you had something which was kind

685
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:33,970
of I'm going to say distributed ledger

686
00:26:32,169 --> 00:26:35,830
rather than blockchain because it

687
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:37,960
doesn't really need the coin type

688
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:39,580
quantities or qualities you often see

689
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,559
with that you could have something where

690
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:43,509
people could just like let's say an

691
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:45,370
entry is new facial-recognition data

692
00:26:43,509 --> 00:26:47,769
that's over the threshold of that ledger

693
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:49,658
and then anyone can add comments it like

694
00:26:47,769 --> 00:26:52,840
I hate this person if they're recognized

695
00:26:49,659 --> 00:26:54,429
on your camera fight them like yeah

696
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,928
that's an option and that data would

697
00:26:54,429 --> 00:26:57,549
never go away and it would be tied to

698
00:26:55,929 --> 00:26:59,049
something you basically can't change but

699
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:03,009
that anyone can access if you're in

700
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:04,480
public so I don't like the idea of it

701
00:27:03,009 --> 00:27:06,600
but it's completely technologically

702
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,600
feasible

703
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:17,620
and it correlated with your cell phone

704
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:17,620
power then you have a narrow group

705
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,820
yeah one thing I've looked into as well

706
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:25,340
as I correlating it with things like

707
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:26,840
mobile phone or laptop probe frames like

708
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:29,209
kind of passive reconnaissance on that

709
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,709
level voice recognition just seeing how

710
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:33,350
much metadata you can kind of get these

711
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:37,240
cross-sections of and have extremely

712
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:37,240
detailed portraits of individual people

713
00:27:46,029 --> 00:27:50,899
it depends it comes down to resolution

714
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:52,129
much more so at that point because kind

715
00:27:50,899 --> 00:27:54,799
of the more data points you have the

716
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:56,120
less specificity you need it can

717
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,289
absolutely would done with just a

718
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,209
picture of the eyes or even just a

719
00:27:57,289 --> 00:28:00,590
picture of the iris but you need to have

720
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,929
a model specifically trained for that

721
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:05,418
and you need to have a level of detail

722
00:28:02,929 --> 00:28:07,100
that success acceptable a full face is

723
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:10,129
more detailed than just kind of the eyes

724
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:11,539
area but if you have a good enough photo

725
00:28:10,129 --> 00:28:14,230
of that section you can definitely do it

726
00:28:11,539 --> 00:28:14,230
with only that

727
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:24,129
like just said that they get them at the

728
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,540
corner they think I'm a criminal would

729
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:27,130
that be enough to track the music's

730
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:28,780
public security cameras with the

731
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:30,250
security cameras also have two high res

732
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:31,690
this security cameras would end up being

733
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,220
kind of the bottleneck and not because

734
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:35,380
generally speaking it wouldn't behind

735
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:38,559
off quality oh and when what I've seen

736
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:40,420
when it's been used to kind of unmask

737
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,820
for lack of a better word protesters

738
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:44,530
it's been with high-resolution

739
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,240
photographs that were just stills and

740
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:48,990
then kind of compiled so higher-quality

741
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,990
the human video

742
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:59,760
and it diminished security analogy you

743
00:28:55,610 --> 00:29:05,610
have let's say pork a security camera

744
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:07,500
a 90-degree elevator at 25 feet was

745
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:09,209
where you would be a hundred pixels per

746
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,520
foot market that's what you use

747
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:13,680
differently from the security camera

748
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,990
perspective to say I can identify that

749
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:19,860
face if I get a good face Spanish are

750
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:23,070
only twenty five feet so you do have

751
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:26,879
either very narrow field of view the

752
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:28,560
person's face to emphasize that the

753
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,790
current camera is being used for facial

754
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,800
recognition elimination state-level are

755
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:33,210
specialized for it a lot of times

756
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,340
they'll zoom in and focus specifically

757
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:36,420
on faces even if it's not to monitor

758
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,949
those people just kind of have a

759
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,360
snapshot of everyone in a public place

760
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:46,590
and kind of have an automated detection

761
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:48,780
and zoom focus function right the

762
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:51,209
failures and that's kind of what you

763
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:52,710
need for that in a public area so I

764
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:54,330
think it's interesting that this can

765
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:55,920
just be applied to any existing camera

766
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:57,629
because it's kind of it's just dealing

767
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,100
with that data but to do it effectively

768
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:04,730
you definitely need specialized

769
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:04,730
equipment any other questions

770
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:13,930
like I floor was the only place I've

771
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:17,950
ever done thinking about this I worked

772
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:21,450
for the guy he'd his wife every year to

773
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:21,450
their vacations

774
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:26,850
when he serves back

775
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:28,500
like how

776
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:29,560
you know if they get it recognized

777
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,830
people what's the

778
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:35,679
Samoas and he sort of seemed that it was

779
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:38,470
always commitment pictures of

780
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:42,460
the statues and so eventually he was

781
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:44,080
like just a minute go away and so then

782
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:46,420
it began to recognize that and I'm just

783
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,908
wondering if your research if you came

784
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:50,129
across other things

785
00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:53,269
not actually false positives with just

786
00:30:50,129 --> 00:30:53,269
things that were not helpful

787
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:58,540
hey I never found any non-face false

788
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:01,300
positives which i think is something

789
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:03,280
kind of interesting but I did definitely

790
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:05,050
see it happen with let's say like very

791
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,040
low quality fixtures the statues things

792
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:07,510
like that something where a face is

793
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,850
being represented especially when you

794
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:11,590
realize that the first step of doing the

795
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:12,879
histogram of gradients discards all

796
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:14,290
color or any information like that

797
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,290
because it goes to black and white

798
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:18,700
immediately so another one to like with

799
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:20,350
that like eyes painting on the face I

800
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,960
found it very difficult to generate

801
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:33,169
false positives which aren't faces

802
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:39,740
whatsoever any other questions thank you

803
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:39,740
