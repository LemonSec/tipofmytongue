1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,319
all right so this is how not to suck at

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,500
vulnerability management with plugin

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:09,719
Chris help where's my plug is currently

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,190
a paranoid fire remember at OAuth he

5
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:14,040
started his journey in computer security

6
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,420
back in 1996 when he discovered a 2600

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,480
magazine that eventually led him to the

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,948
first laa 2600 meeting in 1998 from that

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,260
point forward he has been involved in

10
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,699
computer security his worked as systems

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,260
administrator security analyst and

12
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,269
security engineer in the finance and

13
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,590
telecom sector and it's pretty time he

14
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:30,619
enjoys building Legos and playing with

15
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,000
synthesizers and modular systems

16
00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:36,450
impossible he volunteers his time to

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,890
computer security events chris is a is

18
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,719
currently a senior security engineer at

19
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,550
Verizon digital media services formerly

20
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,170
EdgeCast you started working with

21
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,968
computers in high school and having

22
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,500
older slower computers quickly made the

23
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:50,789
move to Linux and BSD is to improve

24
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,649
performance from Nenana he's worked with

25
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:54,030
Nick systems almost exclusively and a

26
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:55,530
couple of years ago made the switch from

27
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,390
being a systems administrator to working

28
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,530
exclusively in security we're not

29
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,390
working Chris and Joyce cryptocurrencies

30
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,469
his dogs and putting wacky stuff on

31
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:11,460
various raspberry PI's

32
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:12,630
please welcome plugin chris so morning

33
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,140
thank you for being here I know it's

34
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:19,710
early so welcome to shell con

35
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:21,299
so I'm plug grace and so today we're

36
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,649
gonna talk about bone management and

37
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,049
primary we're gonna talk about how not

38
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,320
to sucker bubble management so Chris and

39
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:30,600
I worked for a city and it's braxton

40
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,158
digital media in the past and what we're

41
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,530
gonna told you is our story working on

42
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,299
that environment which is pretty

43
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,560
fast-paced and we see seven to ten

44
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,540
percent of the internet traffic around

45
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,009
the world so there's a lot of data and

46
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,140
it's very important that we manage moun

47
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:44,369
that abilities at a fast pace so without

48
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,399
further ado let's talk about ball

49
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:48,930
management and so why we did this talk

50
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,329
well let's talk about the current

51
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,130
landscape what you can see this screen

52
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:54,630
is a lot of different brands and

53
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,060
companies and they all have a few things

54
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,039
in common the first one is that they all

55
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,439
have been breached and the second one is

56
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,509
that a lot of our data was part of the

57
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,979
breach data that was disposed and so

58
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:07,469
that is really bad for us it's really

59
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:09,270
bad for them on PR but also if you look

60
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:11,299
at the set of vulnerabilities many of

61
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,260
those vulnerabilities are tied into

62
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,599
basically bad

63
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,879
vulnerability management either you have

64
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,980
databases that were suppose you have

65
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:21,690
vulnerabilities and software maybe you

66
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,329
have things that were on buckets that

67
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:26,099
you forgot or credentials on github and

68
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,629
so forth so you know this is part of

69
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:29,069
your program and so this is the reason

70
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:31,260
why we're doing this talk we want to

71
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:34,319
hopefully help other people get better

72
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:39,660
at mall management now I like this

73
00:02:34,319 --> 00:03:04,379
actually I think we just something just

74
00:02:39,660 --> 00:03:07,500
happen here so I like this is light and

75
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:09,298
thank you for that little break so this

76
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,099
is a very important thing because dual

77
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:12,900
apps actually put this report some time

78
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:14,190
ago and they actually discovered there's

79
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,989
a lot of stuff on the cloud that is

80
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,910
really bad and they found a lot of

81
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:19,590
buckets open so if you're using the

82
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:21,450
cloud you know vulnerability management

83
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,160
it's important to you so you know we can

84
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:24,690
tighten laudable net abilities not only

85
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,150
from software side but also in the cloud

86
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:29,220
so that's where we are and this is the

87
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,079
reason why we're doing this talk now

88
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:34,549
before we get further we need to define

89
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:37,230
what vulnerability management is and

90
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:39,269
vulnerability management is not a

91
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,160
compliance checkmark if that's what you

92
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:44,489
think it is you're already doing it

93
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,049
wrong please don't do that and hopefully

94
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:48,750
this talk will help you have a different

95
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:51,780
approach so not a compliance check mark

96
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:54,269
also vulnerability management is is not

97
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,680
easy you know if it was easy everyone

98
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:56,819
will be able to do it so there's

99
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,790
challenges and we want to talk about

100
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:01,138
those when you begin with a

101
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,150
vulnerability management program you're

102
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:04,650
gonna have to set some goals these will

103
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,590
define your program and it will help you

104
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:09,000
mature that program in our experiences

105
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,069
these are the things that are important

106
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,379
and things you should consider so the

107
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:15,328
first one is quick identifications how

108
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:19,349
soon can you identify a vulnerability

109
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:20,699
and you know do something about it so

110
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:22,260
the sooner you know about a

111
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:24,300
vulnerability the better you're able to

112
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,760
respond to that so the goal is to reduce

113
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:29,640
the time to discovery

114
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,860
goal number two is triage now you know

115
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:35,010
that there's a vulnerability then you

116
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,630
have to make a decision the blue team is

117
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,469
due decisions and they have to do it

118
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,659
fairly fast

119
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:41,310
I said vulnerability management team you

120
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:44,340
should be able to do that as well so

121
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:46,080
triage is super important and finally we

122
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,950
want to talk about remediation so now

123
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,080
that you know that there's a

124
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:50,700
vulnerability and you figure out how

125
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,930
important it is to you you need to think

126
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,390
about how you're gonna remediate or

127
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,250
mitigate that vulnerability so those

128
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,599
should be your goals on your program the

129
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:01,080
things that you should target and try to

130
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,700
mature and refine now there are some

131
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,229
challenges and these are important so

132
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,270
first of all there's a lot of sources of

133
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,680
vulnerabilities if you work in an

134
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:09,599
environment where you have different

135
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,580
operating systems multiple Network

136
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,290
devices and so forth you get bulletins

137
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,659
from different places so it's difficult

138
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,770
to navigate that landscape also there

139
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,750
are times where double net ability

140
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:20,909
arrives and there is actually no patch

141
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,440
and sometimes you cannot even patch

142
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:24,660
maybe you are working on outdated

143
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,930
software and so you need to account for

144
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,910
these things so this is an important one

145
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,790
for me a lot of people doable management

146
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,540
they really think about the cbss system

147
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,420
which is the common vulnerabilities

148
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,830
current system and my beef with this

149
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,480
particular thing it's in the standard

150
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:41,039
that is very useful but if you're using

151
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,930
only this core system to drive your

152
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,270
vulnerabilities you're already having

153
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:47,490
problems because you need context to

154
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,380
make decisions you should not rely on

155
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,540
that score system to decide whether

156
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,550
something is critical lower or medium

157
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,900
you should add context and I'm gonna

158
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:58,080
give you some examples of why that

159
00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:01,440
matter so does anyone know what these

160
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,210
symbols mean these so the first one yeah

161
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,620
okay so the first one is heartbleed

162
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:09,719
okay now heartbleed came out on 2014 and

163
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,180
at the time they had this core system

164
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:15,900
version 2.0 if you look at this core

165
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:18,030
it's a 5.0 yet most people treated like

166
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,460
really high so the question is if you

167
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:23,489
were by this core system what would

168
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,890
you've done what do you do and so this

169
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:27,090
is one example of a vulnerability that

170
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:28,830
might have been important for some

171
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:31,919
people and maybe not for others but it

172
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:33,780
was score very low now does anyone

173
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,810
recognize the other label on the bottom

174
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:39,630
so that is a general blue and so that

175
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,560
was an exploit of vulnerability in SMB

176
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,540
an allow

177
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,330
you know the Mirai bar tonight if not

178
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,820
mistaken um so the important thing about

179
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:51,539
this one is that by now we have two

180
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:53,610
scoring systems 2.0 version and 3.0 so

181
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:56,700
if you're going by the 3.0 version which

182
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:58,980
is the latest it was a score at 8.1 if

183
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:01,530
you use that two system it was the score

184
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:03,600
nine point three so then which is core

185
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:05,789
system do you want to use version two or

186
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,530
version three and then if you use any of

187
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:10,710
them you might have downplayed the

188
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:11,989
vulnerability so again context is very

189
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:15,510
important

190
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:17,940
finally it's it score out of ten

191
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:19,260
yes so another thing that is important

192
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,910
is there are sometimes undisclosed

193
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:24,360
vulnerabilities or vulnerable is that

194
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:26,400
get out of CSV right but they don't have

195
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,440
any score system like there's no a score

196
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,560
maybe there is even a patch out there

197
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,820
but you have no score so what do you do

198
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,680
again this is why it's important that

199
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,630
you try not to rely too much on the

200
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,430
scoring system and you build something

201
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:40,650
that allows you to take a consideration

202
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:43,200
the context how does this matter to my

203
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:45,739
organization and what am I gonna do

204
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:48,719
about it so that might be if would see

205
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:52,410
ESS score and again take it with a grain

206
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,820
of salt now when you do a vulnerability

207
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:55,229
management program you have to have some

208
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,330
prerequisites is they're very important

209
00:07:55,229 --> 00:08:01,050
to help you get your program up started

210
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:02,789
really in a good state right and so one

211
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:04,979
of them is you need to know your assets

212
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:06,330
right if you don't know your assets then

213
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:07,800
you don't know what you're gonna have to

214
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:10,680
protect or patch or do something about

215
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,120
so it's very important that if you have

216
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,530
a spreadsheet and you have your IP

217
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,760
addresses host names and everything else

218
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:17,010
it that's fine

219
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:19,530
ideally moving to a CMDB there's a bunch

220
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:21,360
of an open source that totally free you

221
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:23,549
want to make sure you keep your IP

222
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,900
addresses space up-to-date and you you

223
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,890
know that's a very important thing

224
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,750
because you're gonna be scanning and

225
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:30,780
doing other things so a very important

226
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:32,669
concept if you have the cloud there's a

227
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,650
bunch of tools that are open source next

228
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:36,659
flicks is is down this you know down the

229
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:38,280
hallway and actually have security

230
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:39,929
monkey you can use it totally free and

231
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,150
you can get a nice inventory of your

232
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:44,069
assets on the cloud and then you need to

233
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:46,079
consider is the is this vulnerability at

234
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:47,940
play is it a play for the cloud does it

235
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,000
impact me so which is this is and so

236
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,500
forth another very important thing in

237
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,780
vulnerability management is attribution

238
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,210
so now you have a vulnerable

239
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:58,740
you know that impacts a system but then

240
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:00,750
who owns that system

241
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,580
who's gonna patch the system am I

242
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,650
responsible someone else how do I

243
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:07,470
coordinate all of that so being able to

244
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:09,600
attribute that system the ownership is

245
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:11,460
super important and it's super important

246
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,020
because you need to do a triage and you

247
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,790
need to decide who am I going to contact

248
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,250
to get it sorted out so make sure that

249
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:19,650
when you build your asset list you also

250
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:22,470
include who owns the asset is there a

251
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:23,819
team responsible and so forth another

252
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:26,280
thing that is extremely important in

253
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:29,810
this attribution concept is that you

254
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:33,060
never will be an expert on everything so

255
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:34,800
lean on your teams reach out to the team

256
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,359
and say hey I don't know this this seems

257
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,250
to be yours is this yours now does

258
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,500
anyone know about this it's okay you

259
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,930
work in security but other teams know

260
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:47,130
something's systems better than you and

261
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:48,599
so it's okay to reach out do it now

262
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:50,640
we're gonna get a little bit into the

263
00:09:48,600 --> 00:10:00,810
theory and then we come back into some

264
00:09:50,640 --> 00:10:02,040
other topic so there's intelligence from

265
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,329
the outside there's sort of external

266
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,410
intelligence and there's sort of your

267
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:06,030
internal intelligence how your

268
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:08,069
environment looks you want to kind of

269
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:10,170
merge those data sources together in a

270
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:14,190
way that makes sense that way you can

271
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:15,420
you can action the data of it oftentimes

272
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,880
you're gonna find yourself saying things

273
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:19,410
like hey go patch sometimes you'll be

274
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,820
asking other questions about like maybe

275
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,650
like what libraries are used in your

276
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,240
pieces of software but the most

277
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,470
important rule of like doing volt

278
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,810
management well is not to get bogged

279
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:29,430
down like if you're if you find yourself

280
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:31,260
spending two three weeks on each fold

281
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,790
you're gonna you're gonna end up you

282
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,140
know just you're gonna get a backlog of

283
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:35,670
poems that you're not being able to

284
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,410
action because you're gonna get yourself

285
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,449
bogged down too much so make sure that

286
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:40,650
you can you know be a little bit about

287
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:43,560
all lead and like stick and move a bit

288
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:48,400
[Music]

289
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:50,530
all right so external intelligence it's

290
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,880
a buzzword out there now but it can

291
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:54,280
include a bunch of different things so

292
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,680
like public CBE's a blog post security

293
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:59,230
Bolton's other other things you want to

294
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,910
be picky about these sources you know

295
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:02,050
there's there's a ton of them but what

296
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,890
you want to find is you want to find the

297
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,180
ones that give you the most

298
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:06,550
signal-to-noise ratio for your

299
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:08,199
environment so like if you're if you're

300
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:10,599
doing a bunch of stuff in the cloud and

301
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,270
you you're a big Java shop maybe maybe a

302
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,580
bone source from from Oracle that tells

303
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:17,020
you about new phones and Java is what

304
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:19,150
you really want to focus on as you as

305
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:21,310
your first choice you know if you're

306
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:22,990
like us and you run a big a boot to shop

307
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:24,459
bunch of a bunch of servers you know

308
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,780
maybe I'm going to security notices if

309
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:27,280
it's red hat maybe it's red has security

310
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,959
notices if it's Windows maybe you're

311
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,209
you're you know Microsoft security

312
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,440
bulletins but whatever it is you're

313
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,730
gonna record it's gonna require you to

314
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,960
do a little bit of parsing of the data

315
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,850
to really make sense of it and

316
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,890
understand how it works and like that

317
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:41,370
can be human but ideally you'd want to

318
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:43,990
make that as machine parsed as possible

319
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:46,240
so internal intelligence is kind of a

320
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:48,760
buzzword we made up I hope to see it

321
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,080
soon in every talk around the world but

322
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,189
the important things that you want to do

323
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,870
here is you want to you want to take

324
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:54,160
information about your environment you

325
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,450
want to essentially you don't have to

326
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,730
cache it somewhere but you should cache

327
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:59,680
it somewhere for use and you really want

328
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:01,990
to care about accuracy and and quantity

329
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,939
of the data that you're getting like you

330
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:05,500
want you want to gather most if not all

331
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,670
of the the data about your environment

332
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,010
you want to make sure that it's accurate

333
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:11,079
because when when you need to send this

334
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,130
data out elsewhere it later on for

335
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,330
people to do things you want to make

336
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,920
sure that you're not like having to go

337
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,060
back every time and you know ask

338
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,280
questions you want people to trust your

339
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,660
data effectively and this is the point

340
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,459
where it makes a lot of sense to build a

341
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:23,319
lot of your integrations your internal

342
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,450
external intelligence sources or into

343
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,830
your asset management databases or just

344
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:30,220
some of your control structures whatever

345
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:31,690
they happen to be so there are a bunch

346
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,270
of tools that can provide you internal

347
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:37,150
intelligence you can use like a bunch of

348
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:38,410
network stuff there's a network devices

349
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,819
you can look at like you could look at

350
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:42,130
you know your switches and parse out

351
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,420
like every active port you know there's

352
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:45,910
a bunch of different ways to grab this

353
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:48,400
sort of data flow data is something that

354
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:50,079
we've we've started to look at and it

355
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,850
actually provides very good intelligence

356
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,110
about what's sending stuff where so you

357
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,029
can figure out like what services are

358
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:56,829
actually active on your servers

359
00:12:55,029 --> 00:12:59,410
we haven't done anything cool with flow

360
00:12:56,829 --> 00:13:01,329
data yet but you know you should that

361
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:04,509
would be great and open source it so we

362
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:06,128
can use it metrics are important when it

363
00:13:04,509 --> 00:13:07,269
comes to building your program you want

364
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:08,889
to collect your metrics to figure out

365
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:10,660
what's going on and you want to be able

366
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:12,399
to use the metrics you collect to to

367
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:14,620
improve the way that you do things and

368
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,560
you know graphs are great if you can

369
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:19,420
graph out things not only is it fun and

370
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,050
makes me happy it'll it'll make make you

371
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:24,219
a better person

372
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:25,719
maybe but it's very important to make

373
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,579
sure that you don't make like convoluted

374
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,899
graphs like this graph it has a lot of

375
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:29,949
great data in it and if you look at it

376
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:33,250
for a while you can figure out what's

377
00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:36,069
going on but don't don't send this to

378
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,269
somebody and say oh yes this and then

379
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:38,860
you know expect them to really

380
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:41,560
understand what's going on like it's

381
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:43,149
it's it's not gonna do what necessarily

382
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,229
what you want it to do it's alright to

383
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:46,329
make your graphs a little bit higher

384
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:47,769
level this is something that a former

385
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:49,479
member of our team made about our our

386
00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:51,459
network scan information that we got

387
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,750
back and it's actually very consumable

388
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:53,829
like when we when we handed this to

389
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,240
teams they were able to really

390
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:57,339
understand what we were what we were

391
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,319
getting not necessarily mad at but you

392
00:13:57,339 --> 00:14:01,600
know mad at and you know figure out like

393
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:05,979
why what sort of things we were saying

394
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:08,920
out this is important so we're going to

395
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:11,019
talk about triage a little bit here cool

396
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,219
I'm gonna go back and I did this on the

397
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:14,500
previous talk but I really want to

398
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:17,529
emphasize these graph portions so tic

399
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:20,230
again a good look at that chart doesn't

400
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:22,449
really make sense it seems to make sense

401
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:24,670
but it's not it usually how you

402
00:14:22,449 --> 00:14:27,069
quantifies that you could do that better

403
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:29,050
by just say iOS really it just

404
00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:31,059
summarized that maybe version 10 or nine

405
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:33,339
and that's the end of that so this is a

406
00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:36,670
much better readable chart that you want

407
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:38,290
your consumers to have so do take some

408
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:40,509
time to be better charge they really

409
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:43,059
make everyone's life easy they explained

410
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:45,430
the situation fairly good and upper

411
00:14:43,059 --> 00:14:47,620
management actually liked them so please

412
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:49,930
do take care of your matrix and data

413
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,309
let's talk about triage so we remember

414
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:53,079
we talked about goals right the first

415
00:14:51,309 --> 00:14:54,939
goal was to be able to do scorable net

416
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:57,279
abilities and you know understand that

417
00:14:54,939 --> 00:14:58,360
you know whether we're you know there is

418
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,829
something that we should take care of

419
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,329
but then now that you know there's a

420
00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:04,029
vulnerability you want to triage

421
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:05,229
so let's talk about that so in order for

422
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:07,300
you to be able to triage you need to

423
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:08,800
know your software stack so do you have

424
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,109
Java yes

425
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,118
do you have any other package so the

426
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:15,100
more you know yourself for a stack the

427
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:18,579
better you get at triage and stuff so

428
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:21,730
you know CMDB software-related merger

429
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:23,290
them you know use that data you need to

430
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,519
know your environment and sometimes you

431
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,199
don't know your environment because it

432
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:28,179
might be too large or too small but also

433
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:32,579
because there's other teams that know it

434
00:15:28,179 --> 00:15:35,619
better than you again rely on your teams

435
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:37,719
I'm gonna go back again to the CB

436
00:15:35,619 --> 00:15:41,649
because I gotta be with that don't rely

437
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:43,449
on this core because is not everything

438
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,799
that you should care about context is

439
00:15:43,449 --> 00:15:47,410
important so when you're doing triage

440
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:52,470
this core system should be useful but

441
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:54,368
not the main point of your triage so

442
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:55,689
another thing is you need to understand

443
00:15:54,369 --> 00:15:57,189
the vulnerability data you need to

444
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:59,139
validate the findings so let's say that

445
00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:00,910
now you know there's a vulnerability and

446
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:03,519
you decided to explore the vulnerability

447
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:05,829
you know you want to test it does it

448
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,290
work does it can I can it be exploited

449
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:09,969
all my systems you want to validate that

450
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:12,730
because the last thing you want is to

451
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:15,069
create work for teams and it turns out

452
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:17,350
that you know it doesn't work so very

453
00:16:15,069 --> 00:16:22,029
important to do that

454
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:24,429
triage you have to work with people

455
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:26,170
again very important we're hammering on

456
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:27,850
the idea that you need to build a

457
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:29,740
partnership in a relationship with your

458
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:31,629
team members it is difficult to be in

459
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:34,089
security but it's also difficult because

460
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:36,279
we create these notion of we know you

461
00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:39,339
don't know I know you don't know so

462
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:41,589
eliminate that work with people ask them

463
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:43,119
questions right most important thing

464
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:46,600
about this is light is that when in

465
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:49,720
doubt is not only ok to ask you should

466
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,639
and really adhere to that idea it's

467
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:55,059
always okay to ask and you should do

468
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:56,499
that now we have a set of tool sets you

469
00:16:55,059 --> 00:16:58,209
do will manage man there will be a bunch

470
00:16:56,499 --> 00:17:01,600
of tools so let's talk about one that is

471
00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:03,248
extremely crucial which is your trusted

472
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,020
spreadsheet it might sound like it's

473
00:17:03,249 --> 00:17:06,669
like how data or not but really you do a

474
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:08,709
lot of stuff on the spreadsheet use it

475
00:17:06,669 --> 00:17:10,600
maximize it if you're good at Excel or

476
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:12,130
any other spreadsheet you can do a lot

477
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:14,379
of really crazy stuff in there do this

478
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,669
for whatever but you know use it and

479
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,959
write to it at some point you want to

480
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:18,610
move away from that and you want to

481
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:22,020
automate and do other things but for now

482
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:22,020
hey it's in there for you

483
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,660
when you dual management you obviously

484
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:27,369
get into these scanning and you know

485
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,810
tools that do that so you have to

486
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:30,850
understand how you're gonna do a

487
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:33,370
strategy so first one if you're gonna do

488
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:36,070
any tool like next post a novel or any

489
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:38,110
of those then what you want to do is you

490
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:39,550
want to have a discovery strategy you

491
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:41,919
want to first discover things on the

492
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:44,770
network because you know things are

493
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:47,530
fragile so be careful with your scans

494
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:49,750
right it started small and then use a

495
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:51,190
small simple port list you can use the

496
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,650
default list and then start expanding

497
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:54,970
add more ports and start growing you're

498
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:56,950
gonna figure out the things that break

499
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:59,590
the don't break it will be much better

500
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:02,560
do not start your vulnerability

501
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:04,860
management program running a tool and

502
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,220
then doing discovery scans with you know

503
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,929
vulnerability scans

504
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:09,640
you're gonna break things and it's not

505
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:11,890
gonna be looking good you're gonna have

506
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,820
to deal with the seeds of fallout so why

507
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:19,510
start small take it easy you know stages

508
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:21,580
iterations this is a bit of a joke but

509
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:23,470
you know sometimes you use in it and map

510
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,659
and sometimes you can I have to scan a

511
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:27,580
lot of stuff and hopefully you pray that

512
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:31,000
you know it will work and nothing breaks

513
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:34,240
so choose to that that was in Spanish so

514
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,480
I had to modify it a little bit so you

515
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,890
know more about you know scanning so you

516
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,750
have to make a decision that sometimes

517
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:42,100
do what can I do about 10 tickets can so

518
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,090
anyways do anyone know the difference

519
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,969
between authenticated and not

520
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:47,470
authenticated scans yeah so often the

521
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:49,360
key piece cancer those that require

522
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:51,580
credential so you can you know you know

523
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,060
log on as a user and then testimony

524
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:56,290
abilities that way sometimes you can't

525
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:58,000
so do you have to make a decision

526
00:18:56,290 --> 00:19:00,550
you know there's Bali on doing both but

527
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,860
you have to by the way that and also

528
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:04,840
very very important thing is that if you

529
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:07,439
build an infrastructure for scanning or

530
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:10,510
vulnerability management secure it

531
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,280
because is very likely that that

532
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:13,450
environment is gonna have access to a

533
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,180
lot of different things in your

534
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:18,760
environment but that becomes a very

535
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:21,160
critical system that actors can use or

536
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:23,500
even pen testers or maybe you have a red

537
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:26,080
team so make sure that that environment

538
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:29,770
is secure because it can be misused so

539
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,750
very important to do that as well then

540
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:33,010
finally there's a lot of considerations

541
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,080
on your tooling right technology is

542
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,890
changing all the time and so you need to

543
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,210
find evaluate

544
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,980
that were for you there's a lot of them

545
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:41,290
out there so make sure that you test and

546
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:42,940
figure out if they work for you before

547
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:45,159
you introduce new tools make sure that

548
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,630
you meet the basic requirements so don't

549
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,920
don't go and get them you know the

550
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:49,420
latest tool because if you don't have

551
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,760
the basic requirements you're just

552
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:54,520
wasting time so work on the basics right

553
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,470
you CMDB your software stack and then

554
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:59,740
you know then find new tools that will

555
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:02,320
help you improve that this is also a

556
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:05,020
very important thing there is no one

557
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,550
tool fits all so you know the idea that

558
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:09,460
you buy this one tool and that's gonna

559
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:11,379
be everything like you doesn't exist

560
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:13,480
you need to complement tools to help you

561
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:14,680
get there so there is no one told them

562
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,300
we'll do everything and manage your

563
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,410
program for you it's a combination or

564
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:20,770
tools that allow you to have a better

565
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:23,680
program so if you just buy the latest as

566
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:25,240
kind of tool you should rethink about

567
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,250
that and then figure out how you

568
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,200
complement that with other tools

569
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,580
especially when there are plenty of open

570
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,100
source tools like the one we're gonna

571
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,689
share with you today and also you don't

572
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,219
need to repent the will so if you don't

573
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:38,800
have the money or you don't have the

574
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,720
resources or even if you do there's a

575
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,159
lot of tools out there so you know it's

576
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,530
cool that you want a code and you want

577
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,640
to do a lot of tools but why they're

578
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:50,379
already out there and they're actually

579
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:52,090
very nice and ready to go so this is the

580
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,070
last portion with others we talk about

581
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:55,540
internal intelligence and so when we

582
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:57,070
talk about internal internal

583
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,810
intelligence we referred to like how do

584
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:00,639
I collect a lot of data to help me with

585
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:02,110
my vulnerability management like maybe

586
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,760
my inventory isn't good but there's

587
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:05,860
other devices out there that can help me

588
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:09,490
well maybe you're using I don't know I

589
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:11,740
always query or maybe Windows service

590
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:14,260
updates the well you as us I forgot what

591
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:15,790
it stands for but so well there you go

592
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:17,680
when the service update services so if

593
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:19,120
you're using them they have data that

594
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,490
you can use for your vulnerability

595
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:26,080
management just mine diet data and then

596
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:28,810
you improve your visibility on your

597
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,919
asset so you know again tools that are

598
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:32,860
there tools that you probably use on

599
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,630
your network maximize them and with that

600
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:37,000
we're gonna introduce you to Man O'War

601
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:38,590
we're gonna then do a demo Chris is

602
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,560
gonna work on that explain about what it

603
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:44,590
is how we use it and hopefully we'll do

604
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:47,909
a really quick live demo braid it works

605
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:47,909
so let's go

606
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,950
so mental war is a tool we build to to

607
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,330
profile our servers to kind of do the

608
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:55,039
internal intelligence side and then also

609
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:57,860
to do the integrations with the external

610
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,210
external intelligence so the the number

611
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,289
one thing we wanted to do was we wanted

612
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,999
to pull down and boot two security

613
00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:03,679
notices compare them against our

614
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:05,330
environment to see which which which

615
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,899
hosts we're vulnerable and which ones

616
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:10,158
weren't we open sourced a tool called an

617
00:22:08,899 --> 00:22:11,779
internally jellyfish but there's another

618
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,970
Python jellyfish project so we renamed

619
00:22:11,779 --> 00:22:18,860
it Man O War which is like it it's like

620
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:20,240
a jellyfish yeah yeah so like if you

621
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,799
were looking at the the theory graph

622
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,840
that we had earlier and realizing like

623
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:26,210
where does this tie in maybe a little

624
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,549
little box it kind of covers both like

625
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:30,409
external intelligence and internal and

626
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:32,658
external intelligence stuff it kind of

627
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:34,759
combines those two things into audit

628
00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:37,009
results and then provides a UI and an

629
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:39,139
API to let you add both the the parsed

630
00:22:37,009 --> 00:22:41,119
external intelligence and the the

631
00:22:39,139 --> 00:22:42,979
profiles that we record and then you can

632
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:45,439
use it to do your triaging and start

633
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,639
your remediations and all that jazz so

634
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,679
that's kind of like weird where it's

635
00:22:46,639 --> 00:22:50,029
supposed to fit in so we're gonna take

636
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:51,200
you through an example of triaging

637
00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:53,389
we're gonna we're gonna start with the

638
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,159
upstream phone coming in we're gonna

639
00:22:53,389 --> 00:22:56,209
show you how it profiles we're gonna run

640
00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:58,249
an audit and we're going to take a look

641
00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:00,139
at us and three seven six five - one

642
00:22:58,249 --> 00:23:01,999
which is a curl vulnerability that came

643
00:23:00,139 --> 00:23:03,740
out earlier this week then we're going

644
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:06,049
to show you who can do some unstructured

645
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:08,840
data investigation using our passive

646
00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:12,049
profiles and then I'll be the end of the

647
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:14,720
demo so I'm gonna exit out of here I had

648
00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:16,759
a video in case I broke everything but I

649
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,360
don't think I did so we'll see how it

650
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:21,360
works out

651
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:25,280
famous last words all right

652
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,280
[Music]

653
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:29,559
and if if you actually take a look at

654
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:31,970
the code there there are a bunch of

655
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:33,379
a-what apology they're a bunch of

656
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,700
references of the old name jellyfish

657
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:37,580
that I still haven't cleaned up yet so

658
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,960
you know if you're looking and you see

659
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,980
something called jellyfish it's probably

660
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,690
just because I haven't changed it yet

661
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:43,610
because I'm a little bit lazy as a human

662
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:50,840
being it's a personal personal flaw I

663
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:55,399
guess all right see what I mean

664
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:57,320
I could I could yes

665
00:23:55,399 --> 00:24:00,199
so yeah starting up the setting up the

666
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:02,000
UI here the API all combined into one

667
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:05,870
makes a nice little gooey thing

668
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:12,230
available for you these are the this is

669
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:13,219
a sorry typing and talking so this is

670
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:15,590
the one that we're gonna we're going to

671
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:17,480
search on here and then you can see that

672
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:20,809
a booty puts out a new new security

673
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,220
notices pretty regularly so you know

674
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:23,570
we're actually looking at the RSS feed

675
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,710
for this and we're parsing it and that's

676
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:26,539
how we're building down there's stuff

677
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:28,279
there's a tool that does that that I

678
00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:32,059
haven't got open sourced yet it's we

679
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:34,220
call it bass internally but essentially

680
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:41,360
it builds a little files that get a get

681
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:44,360
parsed okay parson to each individual

682
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,850
audit and I'll show you how it looks in

683
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:49,580
the UI cuz it's machine made here and so

684
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:50,870
it looks pretty bad but uh yeah it

685
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:54,230
essentially makes these little audits

686
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:56,719
that we can then and take a look at so

687
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:59,029
I'm gonna start by showing so we have I

688
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,120
have a bunch of LXE containers on my

689
00:24:59,029 --> 00:25:04,309
host yeah I got four of them and then I

690
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,479
used Ezio host to kind of simulate a

691
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:08,690
production environment where there'd be

692
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:10,220
like DNS entries so I'm gonna I'm gonna

693
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:14,049
go ahead and use what I call schedule

694
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:17,389
schedule - it's a second version of a

695
00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:17,879
big ssh type thing that I wrote in

696
00:25:17,389 --> 00:25:40,639
Python

697
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:40,640
[Music]

698
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,970
so what its gonna do is it's gonna reach

699
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:45,170
out to to all the hosts in my thing it

700
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:47,570
doesn't multi-threaded so you could do

701
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:49,309
it a little faster there's also an agent

702
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:50,928
that will push data back to the API but

703
00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:52,399
it doesn't it's it's not it's not

704
00:25:50,929 --> 00:25:53,240
polished so if you want to use it you

705
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:58,130
should definitely make a pull request

706
00:25:53,240 --> 00:26:00,410
and I will probably accept it but it it

707
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:05,510
doesn't go multi-threaded so that it

708
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:07,160
does work pretty fast yeah so you can

709
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:09,080
see it uh you know it has a bunch of

710
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,690
threads open effectively it's just what

711
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,460
I want to show by going there I put the

712
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:14,720
verbose mode on and it has some

713
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:16,610
interesting logging because it was

714
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,080
before I really got into using blogger

715
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:20,000
as a module and now we're kind of

716
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,800
kicking myself about it it's one of the

717
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,450
first projects that I worked on in

718
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,040
Python so if you look at especially the

719
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:28,720
early modules there's a lot of bad code

720
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:31,129
there so pull requests will be helpful

721
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,240
but yeah yeah so it's it's gonna run

722
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:34,550
through here and this takes a little bit

723
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,410
and there are some like wait and see

724
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:39,139
stuff but essentially it's going out to

725
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:40,910
each host and it's it's SS aging on

726
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:43,190
running a series of commands pulling the

727
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:49,250
data back parsing it and then storing it

728
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:51,250
in our database and this is the awkward

729
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:53,110
part

730
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:55,270
yeah this is Asia's although the hosts

731
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:57,428
in profiles that the profiles of hosts

732
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:58,690
by running a bunch of SSH curb runner

733
00:26:57,429 --> 00:27:00,760
running a bunch of bash commands on

734
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:03,280
those bash commands would send the data

735
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:08,740
back in like a formatted manner and then

736
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:10,090
I then I imported into my database yeah

737
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:31,480
yeah it's effectively an authenticated

738
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:37,990
scan and so honest fairly nice way to do

739
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:39,520
and so there's there's an output at the

740
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:41,500
end and show you like what what failed

741
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,510
what didn't fail and then a you know

742
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:48,360
some other things I'm gonna show you how

743
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:52,960
it looks in in the actual host let's see

744
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:55,000
let's go to host church and I only have

745
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,710
five hosts defined so we'll take a test

746
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,960
box two here which is the first LXE

747
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:01,480
container and you can see that I've

748
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,770
pulled back a bunch of results here so I

749
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,659
have some graphs that give me an

750
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:06,220
automatically sometimes it makes sense

751
00:28:04,659 --> 00:28:07,809
sometimes they don't in this case they

752
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,250
do so this is showing you like the the

753
00:28:07,809 --> 00:28:12,129
collection types I pull back I have the

754
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:13,929
concept of type subtype and value so

755
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:16,380
each type is a thing so like here's

756
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:18,640
packages here's Ellis mods here's users

757
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:20,650
things like that and you can add custom

758
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,690
collections in there and then to keep

759
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:24,370
things kind of space-efficient on the

760
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:26,559
backend I record the first time I saw it

761
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:27,908
and the last time I saw it in the

762
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,460
database and I just keep updating that

763
00:28:27,909 --> 00:28:31,780
record every time I see it again that

764
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:33,580
way I don't have to like store a new

765
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,809
entry every time and it cuts down on the

766
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,428
storage space pretty significantly it

767
00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:38,700
kind of keeps like the amount of storage

768
00:28:36,429 --> 00:28:40,780
you need per host relatively static

769
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,809
depending on like how long you keep

770
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:44,918
things after they've gone cut out a date

771
00:28:42,809 --> 00:28:48,270
but you can use this to like look at

772
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:50,350
like what what's going on or like what

773
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:54,670
so like if you wanted to find like the

774
00:28:50,350 --> 00:29:00,370
bash version it should've worked

775
00:28:54,670 --> 00:29:02,500
ah that's because I spell fast wrong and

776
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:04,270
I put it in the wrong thing but yes like

777
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:06,310
you can see that there's a batch package

778
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:08,139
in the version that it's at and you

779
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:10,000
could do this with like users too so

780
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:11,140
like if you wanted to grab the users bag

781
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
and you want to find all the users that

782
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:14,500
you had the bash shell like you can find

783
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,390
out and others there's three on this box

784
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,400
that have the best show and so the yeah

785
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:20,020
it's part of its kind of like how the

786
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:24,640
collections look so now we're going to

787
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:26,230
run the the audits themselves so you can

788
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,390
you can write custom audits you don't

789
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:30,610
have to use like the the past tool the

790
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:33,010
right audits but you you essentially get

791
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:35,139
to decide to bucket things in the host

792
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:37,030
and then do particular comparisons

793
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:38,890
against those hosts the primary use case

794
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:40,389
there is like different versions of

795
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:42,100
Ubuntu or different versions of Red Hat

796
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:43,780
will have different like major version

797
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,189
packages installed and so you want to

798
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:47,020
like when they put the back ports on you

799
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:49,120
want to check against that back ported

800
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:51,490
version not necessarily against like the

801
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:54,669
upstream version or standardized version

802
00:29:51,490 --> 00:30:03,870
across the thing sorry

803
00:29:54,670 --> 00:30:06,760
[Music]

804
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:10,780
yeah and again just recap what we talked

805
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:12,910
about in the past we actually were able

806
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:14,590
to get a lot of intelligence really

807
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:17,440
quick right so we can ask you very

808
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:18,669
important questions like users and you

809
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,250
know all the things that are related to

810
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:23,710
exploit so this is an extra bottle that

811
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:25,570
we gathered yeah so right now it's going

812
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:27,130
through all these hosts and it's it's

813
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,510
it's checking them all right all these

814
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:33,310
audits and checking them against all the

815
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:36,810
hosts this is also multi-threaded so

816
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:40,060
that's fun times there a lot of you know

817
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:41,290
things it does it does it's gonna do its

818
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,879
thing and then I'm gonna run what it was

819
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:43,870
called the kool-aid I broke those out

820
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,520
because it's our environment there were

821
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:46,449
enough host we're trying to collate

822
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,610
while you're collect or where you're

823
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:49,990
analyzing didn't work well but really

824
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:51,219
it's just it's just summing up all the

825
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:53,380
values and sticking it in so that will

826
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:54,700
happen shortly afterwards but when you

827
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:56,110
look at it you can see that it's doing

828
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,910
inserts and updates its kind of using

829
00:30:56,110 --> 00:31:00,520
that same storage model where if I see

830
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:02,350
an audit pass or fail and and I see it

831
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:04,389
again instead of storing each individual

832
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:06,189
audit pass or failure I can just you

833
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:07,990
know update and say I saw I saw it start

834
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:10,240
to fail here and start end to fail here

835
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:11,590
so you kind of get this idea of like how

836
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,300
long it was without an ax store

837
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:18,439
different values across for for

838
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:24,800
everything collate

839
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:27,090
[Music]

840
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:31,919
alright so the kool-aid ran so let's

841
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:33,419
let's show you some audits here so there

842
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,860
there is a dashboard that hasn't been

843
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:38,160
open source yet it was made by our UI

844
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:39,330
team who's like their wizards but it's

845
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,309
in a different repo and so we didn't

846
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:44,280
have time to go get it open source and

847
00:31:41,309 --> 00:31:46,020
it looks much better than this page but

848
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:49,350
you know this page is what I have at the

849
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:52,770
moment 765 I believe yes so this is the

850
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:55,169
Chrome open it up and you can see like

851
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:58,230
historically what's what's gone down and

852
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:59,760
tomorrow it'll have a different graph so

853
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:01,620
and this is actually something I could

854
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:04,290
show to like last night the automated

855
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:06,300
upgrade ran on all my LXE containers and

856
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:08,220
actually upgraded all my curl versions

857
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:10,080
because I have an automatic security

858
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:13,320
note things turned on for these LXE

859
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:16,199
containers because you know why not and

860
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:18,230
so now they all pass which is great but

861
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:21,480
yeah so you can see that I've bucketed

862
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:22,920
things it based on their version this is

863
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,270
but when you get by default I guess I

864
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,250
should assume into that make it a little

865
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:27,720
easier to read yeah so I did

866
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:29,250
things based on like what version

867
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:32,190
they're on there's a collection in there

868
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:34,230
that tells you like the uses LSB release

869
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:35,760
- a to figure out like what what a blue

870
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:38,880
- version you're in and then I've

871
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,200
checked against the thing and I check

872
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,120
each of these to see if the version is

873
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,830
greater than this for this particular

874
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,510
package or this collection type and

875
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:47,760
subtype

876
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:51,120
combination which it which matches what

877
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:53,370
you see here in in the actual audit

878
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:55,290
itself like each one of these it's like

879
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:56,370
it essentially it's just parsing and

880
00:32:55,290 --> 00:33:00,360
making you audit that makes sense for

881
00:32:56,370 --> 00:33:01,770
that alright I think the next thing I

882
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:04,320
was going to show is like how did you

883
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:06,000
some of the investigation said it's like

884
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,490
you don't always want to work off and

885
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,050
Aude it sometimes you want to just you

886
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:12,840
know you get a question like hey what's

887
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:15,230
blah for that we have two different two

888
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:17,309
main types of searches collect like

889
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:19,860
collected values and collected sub types

890
00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:21,510
then we also had like by pop and by surf

891
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:24,000
set pop you can thief like a data center

892
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:25,500
and then like surf type you can think

893
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,940
about it so like I have a workstation

894
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,590
reserved type that I added here which is

895
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:30,260
just this workstation I literally SSH

896
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,970
into my own workstation and added

897
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:33,500
the collection but you could look at

898
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:36,230
like how many audits it's passing and

899
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:38,210
failing or like how many hosts are in

900
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:40,010
that that particular particular sheriff

901
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:41,780
type you could sort them down and you

902
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:44,240
you know you could click in and click

903
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:46,940
cloud and things like that so like let's

904
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,020
say you wanted to find see what was the

905
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:50,960
example that I put in here

906
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:52,220
I will go packages bash again right cuz

907
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,740
everything's gonna bash package right

908
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:56,750
now so this would pull back like the

909
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:59,150
versions of bash that are seen in the

910
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:00,800
environment and then like what host

911
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:02,810
they're on so you could look at you know

912
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:05,780
like here's here's the Pops or data

913
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:07,190
centers or here's here's the SERP types

914
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,659
that are there all right here's the

915
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:11,899
values this one makes a lot more sense

916
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:14,060
when you have you know differing set of

917
00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:18,830
values but you know you get the idea

918
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:21,020
same thing with like the subtypes one of

919
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:23,409
those the general one we show is like

920
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:27,800
users so like you could look for

921
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:29,510
shooters at user users will find out oh

922
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:36,860
it's but you could look at like users

923
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:37,940
and users fun times but yeah you could

924
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:39,080
pull back and so you can look at your

925
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:41,780
environment you can say alright so I've

926
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:44,389
got across my environment I've got apt

927
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:46,070
user on everything all five hosts but on

928
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:48,649
one host it's been false one host it's

929
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:50,270
bit/s been to login that's mainly

930
00:34:48,649 --> 00:34:51,409
because my workstation was an upgrade so

931
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:53,418
it used to be been full so now it's has

932
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:55,610
been no logging but yeah you can so you

933
00:34:53,418 --> 00:34:56,899
could be to pull back and you could take

934
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:59,510
a look at like all the things there so

935
00:34:56,899 --> 00:35:01,520
like you could look at all the users

936
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:03,620
that have you know bashes their shell

937
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,180
and you can see that you know me and and

938
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,470
my root user are on everything and then

939
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:08,600
the sublimity user is just on my

940
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:10,490
forehead like see containers like so you

941
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,170
could start to pull back data about your

942
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:13,490
environment and because you can add your

943
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:14,810
own custom collections in here it's not

944
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:16,459
just limited to what you can do security

945
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:17,840
was you could also do investigations

946
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:20,180
about like your own custom versions of

947
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:22,250
packages or settings that you've set and

948
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:25,129
things like that that's that's kind of

949
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:27,710
the the full demo there um so you take

950
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:29,930
you take the the USN the Kroll and then

951
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:31,640
you you look at it and say alright and

952
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:33,230
you'd start to start to do your triaging

953
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:35,810
right you'd say do we use curl on our

954
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:37,590
thing look it's affected here what's the

955
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:39,240
impact of patching

956
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:41,190
you could really take it and start to

957
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,709
use this intelligence instead of having

958
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:47,520
to say well how bad does this affect us

959
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:49,020
sort of there are I should I should

960
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,840
point out some caveats there are a bunch

961
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:53,009
of slightly broken things because we we

962
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,810
kind of took it out of the environment

963
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:55,920
and second into an open-source one so

964
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:58,140
there's like a bunch of helper scripts

965
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,000
that aren't there anymore that I thought

966
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:02,370
I'd need to fix and it was designed with

967
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,440
the boon to only in mind not only but

968
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:05,580
like we took shortcuts to make it work

969
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,590
with the pen too so if you want to use

970
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,549
it on RedHat you'd have to do some

971
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:11,640
things or if you want to use it on a

972
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:13,050
Windows you'd have to do things and then

973
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,460
yeah dashboard hasn't been open source

974
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:15,990
yet and there's lots of references to

975
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:21,810
jellyfish that I should go grab and fix

976
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:26,609
and I think that's the demo so we'll go

977
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:28,670
back to you alright so again I'm just

978
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:30,990
gonna recap on what happened here so

979
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:32,760
this is a tool that was being built

980
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:36,299
chris is the mastermind of the tool and

981
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:38,190
the main goal is these tool does the

982
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,930
coiling tilton Decatur scans were SSH

983
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:42,150
into things and we're mining the data on

984
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:44,250
all the systems we're actually able to

985
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:46,860
do a lot better than authenticated scans

986
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:48,270
because we can do these on the man and

987
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:50,160
we can do it on the fly we save the data

988
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:52,380
so we are able to do really fast

989
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,609
reactions that ability comes in so the

990
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,320
other thing that is not very clear on

991
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:57,950
this example is that since we're

992
00:36:55,320 --> 00:37:00,450
grabbing the US ends as they come in is

993
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:02,189
automated literally our USM comes in or

994
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:03,750
like just okay is there new u.s.n oh

995
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:06,600
okay so new bull net ability are we

996
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:08,280
impacted maybe maybe not so it's now

997
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,960
automated to the point that we can

998
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:14,610
concentrate on other important things

999
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:17,250
like remediation and mitigation so when

1000
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:19,290
you work on mitigation and remediation

1001
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:21,560
which are two different things you need

1002
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:24,060
to interact with organization and so

1003
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:25,590
sometimes you need to cut tickets and

1004
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:28,259
you need to basically time go and fix

1005
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:30,690
that so be mindful of the tickets that

1006
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:32,460
you create organizations make sure that

1007
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:34,140
you test you know if you're gonna

1008
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:37,500
provide some remediation instructions

1009
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:40,020
that they actually do work do not shame

1010
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:42,420
people that is a very bad thing about

1011
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:43,740
our culture in security we're not there

1012
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:46,320
to Shane we're there to provide a

1013
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:47,939
service our services to secure the the

1014
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,070
assets in the company or the company

1015
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:51,420
organization it work for shaming someone

1016
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:54,359
for not doing something

1017
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:56,490
it might work but it doesn't pay off in

1018
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:58,920
the long run so a boy that use the

1019
00:37:56,490 --> 00:38:01,140
shaming when you really need it it's a

1020
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:03,720
nice tool but you have to be careful and

1021
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:06,299
be you know not knowledgeable to want to

1022
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:08,848
use that the data that you have has to

1023
00:38:06,299 --> 00:38:11,099
be accurate it's very important so one

1024
00:38:08,849 --> 00:38:12,720
of the values of jellyfish is that since

1025
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:14,970
we're able to collect and aggregate data

1026
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,589
our value of data intelligence that

1027
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:19,799
internal intelligence that we call is

1028
00:38:16,589 --> 00:38:21,420
super high so because of the value of

1029
00:38:19,799 --> 00:38:25,200
the data were able to make very fast

1030
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:26,910
decisions another thing that it was in

1031
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,618
here is the idea of cell service at some

1032
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:30,089
point you want to kind of let teams do

1033
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:32,460
their own thing and be like hey here's

1034
00:38:30,089 --> 00:38:34,200
this tool go and find out there's blue

1035
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:36,059
net abilities you know you want to

1036
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,890
remediate then you can go on cell

1037
00:38:36,059 --> 00:38:39,660
service and as you pass you will find

1038
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:42,089
out if you're passing the alloted yes or

1039
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:43,379
no and so that way they're keeping track

1040
00:38:42,089 --> 00:38:44,730
and they're making sure they're doing

1041
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:48,510
you know the progress in on the

1042
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:50,099
remediation you know there's another

1043
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:51,690
important thing that there is a concept

1044
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:53,369
of remediation and mitigation you know

1045
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:54,569
what are your patching capabilities can

1046
00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:56,839
i patch

1047
00:38:54,569 --> 00:38:59,460
you know how fast can i deploy a patch

1048
00:38:56,839 --> 00:39:00,839
how accurate is that patch is that gonna

1049
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:03,900
work or is there gonna break certain

1050
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:06,359
things the other thing is you might not

1051
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:07,859
be able to patch so like maybe you can

1052
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:09,390
mitigate something so this is why

1053
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:12,328
knowing your network is very important

1054
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:15,328
you can put some ACLs in place maybe you

1055
00:39:12,329 --> 00:39:17,970
decide to limit the users I have access

1056
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:19,079
to something so remediation mitigation

1057
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:20,939
two different things but they were

1058
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:23,099
fairly well together sometimes you need

1059
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:25,140
to mitigate something stop that bleed

1060
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:27,089
and then you work into how you're gonna

1061
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,348
owe me a tit you need to think about the

1062
00:39:27,089 --> 00:39:32,970
idea and figure out the best way to

1063
00:39:28,349 --> 00:39:34,589
address that is very important in ball

1064
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:37,859
management that you document your

1065
00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:39,359
decisions because things could go bad

1066
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:41,160
and you want to make sure that you

1067
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:43,619
document them they're right you need to

1068
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:45,270
let your organization know hey we're

1069
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:46,260
gonna make the decision you're okay with

1070
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:48,480
that yes

1071
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:51,329
all right cool it's now documented so

1072
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,150
something goes wrong you can then say

1073
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:55,650
hey we asked for advice and we wanted to

1074
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:56,940
make sure that you were aware of these

1075
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:59,520
things because things could go wrong

1076
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:00,809
document your decisions make sure that

1077
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,940
people know that you're doing those

1078
00:40:00,809 --> 00:40:06,190
things again the relationship between

1079
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:12,019
you and organization is super important

1080
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:14,719
pitfalls it's gonna happen so what you

1081
00:40:12,019 --> 00:40:17,450
gonna do when the day where things go

1082
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:19,579
really really bad well our advice is

1083
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:22,578
that's gonna happen and one of the eight

1084
00:40:19,579 --> 00:40:23,289
things are gonna go to hell first do not

1085
00:40:22,579 --> 00:40:27,349
panic

1086
00:40:23,289 --> 00:40:29,150
just chill pause for a moment don't

1087
00:40:27,349 --> 00:40:32,450
blame and shame again it's no one's

1088
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:34,069
fault things just happen right and then

1089
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:35,598
the most important thing when things

1090
00:40:34,069 --> 00:40:36,529
goes out is that you need to conduct

1091
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,049
lessons learn

1092
00:40:36,529 --> 00:40:42,380
figure out what why things went wrong

1093
00:40:39,049 --> 00:40:43,910
how what can you do different if you

1094
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:46,640
take these approaches you're gonna be

1095
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:48,229
able to one improve your yourself you're

1096
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,058
gonna build a better relationship with

1097
00:40:48,229 --> 00:40:53,419
your peers and three you're gonna

1098
00:40:50,059 --> 00:40:55,670
improve your program so again this is

1099
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:57,469
advice that we experienced and we can

1100
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:58,130
tell you this so take this with the same

1101
00:40:57,469 --> 00:41:01,009
girl

1102
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:04,940
with a grain of salt but use this advice

1103
00:41:01,009 --> 00:41:06,289
it's gonna be valuable to you so now we

1104
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,999
cannot talk about the vulnerability

1105
00:41:06,289 --> 00:41:09,829
management program that's gonna like and

1106
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:11,448
standard program so then most programs

1107
00:41:09,829 --> 00:41:13,880
should aim and do and again we're gonna

1108
00:41:11,449 --> 00:41:15,769
repeat the two goals so understandable

1109
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,809
and abilities triage them fast and then

1110
00:41:15,769 --> 00:41:19,879
work on remediation and mitigation but

1111
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:21,140
we now know that there are other things

1112
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,660
out there people are using the cloud

1113
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:25,699
people are using new languages and so

1114
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:28,249
forth so we have next-level ideas so you

1115
00:41:25,699 --> 00:41:30,380
got your your vulnerability management

1116
00:41:28,249 --> 00:41:32,269
program mature alright let's let's get

1117
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:34,369
to improve that so why don't you

1118
00:41:32,269 --> 00:41:35,749
Masek Alize start making games out of

1119
00:41:34,369 --> 00:41:38,599
that why don't you create a scoreboard

1120
00:41:35,749 --> 00:41:40,519
where you track who is matching faster

1121
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:42,109
or who is the one that is able to work

1122
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:45,529
with you better and maybe give him some

1123
00:41:42,109 --> 00:41:46,910
swag who doesn't love swag well we got

1124
00:41:45,529 --> 00:41:48,920
some swag in here that we'll share with

1125
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:50,449
you for those that ask questions so you

1126
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,920
know that good example of why you want

1127
00:41:50,449 --> 00:41:54,589
to do stuff like that

1128
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,779
another thing is work towards automation

1129
00:41:54,589 --> 00:41:58,788
so the the stuff that we show in here is

1130
00:41:56,779 --> 00:42:00,079
all the words that Chris did has been

1131
00:41:58,789 --> 00:42:01,640
possible because there's a lower cost

1132
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,680
efficient automation so if you can

1133
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:05,868
actually move towards that level you're

1134
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,669
gonna be golden so make sure that your

1135
00:42:05,869 --> 00:42:09,650
program moves towards that direction

1136
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:12,049
it's better that you can let us can run

1137
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:13,489
come back and those you know the self

1138
00:42:12,049 --> 00:42:16,880
assessment for you and just click a few

1139
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:19,250
buttons very useful so but again make

1140
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,840
sure that if you're using orchestration

1141
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:23,780
you want to secure your pipeline because

1142
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:26,060
you know people use Jenkins and Jenkins

1143
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:27,800
is very easy to exploit and people like

1144
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:31,190
to exploit that so make sure that you

1145
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:33,410
take care of that as well finally a very

1146
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:34,970
good thing to have any organization is

1147
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:38,420
bug bounty you want to get into the bug

1148
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:40,370
bounty program be ready if you're not

1149
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:42,980
mature you don't have some of the basics

1150
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:44,240
do not even attempt to do that it will

1151
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,200
be a waste of your time it will be a

1152
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,930
waste of forever

1153
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:50,270
you're gonna get plenty of data be ready

1154
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:51,950
to be able to respond to those reports

1155
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:55,250
be mindful the people that are doing

1156
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:57,169
that partnered with any other known bug

1157
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:58,940
bounty you know entities that are doing

1158
00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:02,750
that so it's a recommendation a very

1159
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:04,670
valuable one we had this is lightning

1160
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:08,030
here which is how not to make sure your

1161
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:09,590
program success the sex of your program

1162
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:11,660
is gonna be made sure by you and it's

1163
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:15,590
different organization you're gonna

1164
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:18,200
define that goal the way that we define

1165
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:19,760
how we make sure our maturity on our

1166
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:22,759
program was early on with the three

1167
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,860
goals that we define and as you are able

1168
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:26,810
to see we're able to be very mature in

1169
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:28,820
that regard we're able to get

1170
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:30,920
vulnerabilities extremely fast we're

1171
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:32,840
able to triage fairly fast and we're

1172
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:35,090
able to provide the service on how to

1173
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:37,340
remediate immediate remediated mitigate

1174
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:39,260
things so we feel very confident that

1175
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:41,450
our program has reached a really nice

1176
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:43,160
maturity level your program might be

1177
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:44,930
different you need to understand your

1178
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:47,740
goals and then your goals will define

1179
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:50,240
how you're measuring your program

1180
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:52,339
finally we're gonna have some takeaways

1181
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,140
I'm gonna let Chris also keeps kissing

1182
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:55,640
put in that so the most important thing

1183
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:57,980
for me in here is that there is this

1184
00:43:55,640 --> 00:44:01,190
concept of odor loop which is you know

1185
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:03,080
you repeat something so iterations on

1186
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:03,680
your program are very important do

1187
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,299
something

1188
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,250
figure out what did why didn't work

1189
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:14,900
improve it get better and just keep

1190
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:16,730
repeating and then Chris it's surprising

1191
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:18,050
how much better like you get at full

1192
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:19,850
management when you just start to

1193
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:21,470
iterate and you say oh we didn't we

1194
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:23,060
didn't handle that vuln esses airily the

1195
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:25,459
best but we're not gonna like go and

1196
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:27,200
super focus on it and like have sixteen

1197
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:29,060
continuous Sprint's of like we're gonna

1198
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,680
fix this foam instead going and saying

1199
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:32,369
all right well let's just go to the next

1200
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:34,828
one because that one's just as bad

1201
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:35,819
you do want to do I said it before but

1202
00:44:34,829 --> 00:44:36,960
you got a stick and move

1203
00:44:35,819 --> 00:44:39,210
yeah get a little Muhammad I'll be in

1204
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,829
there and then always always make sure

1205
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:41,970
to evaluate your data like if you're

1206
00:44:40,829 --> 00:44:43,559
working with junk data you're gonna get

1207
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:44,970
junk results and you're gonna get you

1208
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:46,470
know garbage in garbage out essentially

1209
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:48,419
so so make sure that the data that

1210
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:50,009
you're making decisions on actually

1211
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:54,180
makes sense and it's actually useful for

1212
00:44:50,009 --> 00:44:56,670
your department yeah and with that we

1213
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:58,379
get two conclusions we have a we have a

1214
00:44:56,670 --> 00:45:00,089
different jacket and this one there's a

1215
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:01,499
bunch of tools that originally we want

1216
00:45:00,089 --> 00:45:03,650
to share with you there's a lot of open

1217
00:45:01,499 --> 00:45:06,058
source and they're broken down this time

1218
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:08,069
you wouldn't take the picture of that so

1219
00:45:06,059 --> 00:45:09,329
what we have is now this cool she that

1220
00:45:08,069 --> 00:45:11,490
covered is a bunch of open source tools

1221
00:45:09,329 --> 00:45:14,099
that you can use we're gonna have the

1222
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:16,200
link to talk in there as well you know

1223
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:19,710
and so you have an opportunity to test a

1224
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:21,450
bunch of the tools out there we tested

1225
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:23,849
many of them we know that they work we

1226
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:25,589
suggested them for you so is your turn

1227
00:45:23,849 --> 00:45:27,089
to investigate them and use them again

1228
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:29,660
they're free and the tool we just

1229
00:45:27,089 --> 00:45:42,420
provided you to you is free so with that

1230
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:44,420
any questions how easy could your system

1231
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:47,489
be ported over to a Debian system

1232
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:49,140
probably probably fairly simply the

1233
00:45:47,489 --> 00:45:51,150
biggest kind of a boon to specific

1234
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:55,140
requirement we use we use the the apt

1235
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:57,539
package like Python module and I think

1236
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:59,368
boom to distributes that but I mean we

1237
00:45:57,539 --> 00:46:01,970
should be able to drop and replace some

1238
00:45:59,369 --> 00:46:04,529
other we use it for for process or for

1239
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:05,819
parsing version data and there's there's

1240
00:46:04,529 --> 00:46:06,989
there's stuff in the standard library

1241
00:46:05,819 --> 00:46:07,529
that I could have used if I were more

1242
00:46:06,989 --> 00:46:12,390
intelligent

1243
00:46:07,529 --> 00:46:15,490
so like install Debian system

1244
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:17,440
so like it you definitely get it going

1245
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:19,359
fairly simply all that simply but like

1246
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:28,540
with a small amount of elbow grease

1247
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:34,710
so comedian or large I told you we're

1248
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:34,710
gonna its left so

1249
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:53,380
this is one of the things that everybody

1250
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:58,119
into is when I'm continuing do you but

1251
00:46:53,380 --> 00:47:08,680
to eighteen point oh four stall there's

1252
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:10,540
this little process so the insulation we

1253
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:12,339
have like salt that we use at our

1254
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:14,230
company for like handling like config

1255
00:47:12,339 --> 00:47:16,359
management type stuff it's like it's

1256
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:18,700
like ansible or puppet and that's how we

1257
00:47:16,359 --> 00:47:21,369
handle kind of the config side for each

1258
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:23,379
server like making sure the like the SSH

1259
00:47:21,369 --> 00:47:25,180
keys on each server and making sure that

1260
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:27,130
like even though like the what we call

1261
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:29,319
the jellyfish servers by themselves the

1262
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:30,160
making sure that all the right jobs are

1263
00:47:29,319 --> 00:47:32,558
in the right place and all the right

1264
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,750
code landed in the right places but I

1265
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:36,040
have an open source like we have an open

1266
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:39,940
source like are what we call bundler

1267
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:43,710
like our packaging system so it would be

1268
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:43,710
a lot of manual work at the moment oh

1269
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:48,900
okay yeah

1270
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:56,890
kind of painful if I'm trying to

1271
00:47:52,900 --> 00:48:02,980
research them like definitely see how

1272
00:47:56,890 --> 00:48:06,279
that that works what some awesome things

1273
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:10,619
you do any like or ideas of what we can

1274
00:48:06,279 --> 00:48:10,619
do to make a better self remediation

1275
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:16,660
security might have recommendations on

1276
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:19,029
how to do it but there's a lot more not

1277
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:24,368
security people to actually get the

1278
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:26,200
things done um oh so the I guess the

1279
00:48:24,369 --> 00:48:28,230
question is what what sort of things

1280
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:37,569
should you be doing next

1281
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:39,130
oh yeah so what sort of things should

1282
00:48:37,569 --> 00:48:41,440
you be providing to your organization to

1283
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:43,960
help them self or mediate essentially

1284
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:45,069
the data that you're looking at it's

1285
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:48,099
something that you should provide to

1286
00:48:45,069 --> 00:48:50,380
your work and you excuse me you might

1287
00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:52,029
want to like limit who has access to it

1288
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:54,009
because it you know it kind of tells you

1289
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:56,319
how you can attack your environment but

1290
00:48:54,009 --> 00:48:58,839
it for that for the people responsible

1291
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:00,099
for administering your boxes handing

1292
00:48:58,839 --> 00:49:02,890
them data that says hey you're

1293
00:49:00,099 --> 00:49:05,019
vulnerable to X is very powerful to them

1294
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:06,848
and AH and like they can go and they can

1295
00:49:05,019 --> 00:49:08,078
they can fix that themselves if if they

1296
00:49:06,849 --> 00:49:10,869
just know that they're vulnerable to

1297
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:12,549
something and it helps them make make

1298
00:49:10,869 --> 00:49:14,769
the case to their management that they

1299
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:16,839
should really be handling X like higher

1300
00:49:14,769 --> 00:49:18,788
up on their to-do list right maybe maybe

1301
00:49:16,839 --> 00:49:20,769
this gets in in front of some other you

1302
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:22,240
know improvement or feature requests

1303
00:49:20,769 --> 00:49:25,149
because they know that hey it's security

1304
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:29,618
has they see us they're like let's go

1305
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:32,680
fix it before they get mad at us yeah I

1306
00:49:29,619 --> 00:49:34,210
would like to do that question that we

1307
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:35,529
talked about garbage in garbage out

1308
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:37,660
your quality of the data that you

1309
00:49:35,529 --> 00:49:39,519
provide to someone is really important

1310
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:41,379
right so if you go to the nitty gritty

1311
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:43,149
of hey this is the package you need to

1312
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:45,069
fix this is the one that is bad this is

1313
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:48,339
the one that you need to replace it with

1314
00:49:45,069 --> 00:49:50,230
and here's how you do it sometimes it

1315
00:49:48,339 --> 00:49:51,700
just is just super easy you want to get

1316
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:53,920
like three bullet points on how to solve

1317
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:55,359
the problem if you are able to do that

1318
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,619
then you're basically the part where

1319
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:59,319
everyone to do it and over time people

1320
00:49:56,619 --> 00:50:01,180
will realize that they can just make it

1321
00:49:59,319 --> 00:50:02,050
even simpler you tell them what to do

1322
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:04,540
and they

1323
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:06,940
they just follow but if you send them a

1324
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:09,490
report like many people have done so

1325
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:11,470
there's even pen testers do this they

1326
00:50:09,490 --> 00:50:13,540
have a report out of their tool and it's

1327
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:15,580
not really meaningful right if you just

1328
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:17,590
give them a report scan that says here

1329
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:19,540
these are all the vulnerabilities like

1330
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:21,610
who's gonna read that you'd have to make

1331
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:23,050
it so it's like bullet points this is

1332
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:23,530
one letter bill everyone this is how you

1333
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:25,240
fix it

1334
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:27,400
well number two is how you fix it that's

1335
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:28,339
how you actually do things and use

1336
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:31,530
polite things

1337
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:31,530
[Music]

1338
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:52,490
we reached a point actually at about

1339
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:54,080
thirty thirty thousand dish shows twenty

1340
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:55,250
thirty thousand hosts well we started

1341
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:57,950
running into problems with with

1342
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:59,750
performance on a fairly beefy single box

1343
00:50:57,950 --> 00:51:01,370
at that point you're gonna want to look

1344
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:04,010
at like splitting out your collections

1345
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:06,200
across multiple hosts we did have some

1346
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:08,900
ideas about how we'd rewrite the Manowar

1347
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:11,419
to be like more cloud native so I use

1348
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:13,160
like RDS and API gateway and stuff like

1349
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:14,570
that but we haven't built that type of

1350
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:17,210
stuff yet but yeah there is definitely a

1351
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:18,590
limit at which you have to start you

1352
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:19,820
know splitting your work up into

1353
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:21,320
multiple hosts and there's not

1354
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:25,160
necessarily a lot of tooling to help you

1355
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:27,800
do it so once you reach that point by

1356
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:29,839
pull requests and I will accept them

1357
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,950
I've never turned down a pull request so

1358
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,540
I think we're running out of time so

1359
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:34,759
we're out of time thank you for being

1360
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:36,770
here one final note is that you can

1361
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:38,960
actually carve a lot of queries so you

1362
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:41,150
can use this phrase to response blue

1363
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,410
teams so we got any questions where

1364
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:43,760
we'll be out there thank you for being

1365
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:46,149
here it's out in the morning and joy

1366
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,150
shotgun
