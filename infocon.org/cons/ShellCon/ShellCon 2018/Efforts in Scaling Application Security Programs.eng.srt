1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,400
yeah this is pepper X's security of

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,379
scaling application security program so

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,280
they aren't fed Eric is an information

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,690
security when you're currently

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,989
specializing an application security

6
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,309
needs the application security program

7
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:16,740
manager application security in Santa

8
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:18,210
Monica Brad as careers responsibilities

9
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,340
have covered protecting applications

10
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,720
infrastructure and web presences of the

11
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,430
major brands Dow Jones Wall Street

12
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,390
Journal Market Watch and personally Hulu

13
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:31,410
please welcome Eric on TNT

14
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:33,090
thanks thanks yes thanks for joining

15
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,040
others get a lot of good talks and worth

16
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,410
a very end of it so let's try to get

17
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,910
through it real quick yeah so really

18
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,148
quick I'm gonna start with really quick

19
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:44,940
intro names Eric they lead up the app

20
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:47,280
sect program at Hulu so were based out

21
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,149
of Santa Monica been there for about

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,100
four years

23
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:52,199
natives grant onehans so throw any

24
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,489
office references you have Scranton

25
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,690
strangler

26
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:56,610
I can't think feel the ones right now

27
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,649
but throw in my way

28
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,030
so before that I was working at InfoSec

29
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,780
and Dow Jones that's supposed to be a

30
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:06,210
gift but it's a PDF so let's change it

31
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,689
change it over so for the agenda for

32
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:12,630
this this is primarily gonna be a retro

33
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:14,639
for you know how we started and built

34
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,979
out and scaled and kind of kept up with

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,470
this successor who live over time for

36
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,750
the application security program so no

37
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,070
awesome blockchain demos or anything

38
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,950
unfortunately for this one that's

39
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:27,960
primarily gonna be a retro but yeah the

40
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,750
reason for why I wanted to create this

41
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,360
talk was a lot of retro talks I saw my

42
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,610
earlier years back were very useful for

43
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,140
me and kind of seeing other people when

44
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,270
they were in similar positions what they

45
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,540
did what they try to focus on prioritize

46
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:44,820
things they built things of that nature

47
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:46,710
so I'm hoping some of these things that

48
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,449
we've done are helpful for you guys in

49
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,439
the audience as well can can take away

50
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,570
something useful

51
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,869
timeline like I said 2014 to you

52
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:56,130
yesterday ish to future state I put some

53
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:58,950
current stuff in there so hopefully we

54
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:02,039
can kind of go over that I've broken

55
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:05,070
into very loose phases of open pastures

56
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,530
expansion maturing and future so again I

57
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,848
didn't have a lot of you know quarterly

58
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,340
breakdown so this is gonna be very

59
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:13,500
strict it's gonna be super wide open and

60
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:18,060
big so the first phase was run

61
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:19,380
for tina joined hulu and i've broken in

62
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,030
a few different sections in each of

63
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:25,470
these phases as well so just to describe

64
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:27,420
the landscape of you know joined first

65
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:31,170
apps i hire they're a really small

66
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,309
security team overall the at the time

67
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,739
there's a lot of smart engineers and

68
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,780
developers creating great features and

69
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,220
products that only some of them cared

70
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:43,650
about security but it wasn't a primary

71
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:44,550
focus so the very agile development

72
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,310
processes

73
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:49,470
you know deploying was everywhere

74
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,120
always constantly probably right now

75
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,320
it's kind of still that way to be honest

76
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:58,320
but it's a little bit more matured in

77
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:59,430
this this overall process was and at the

78
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,579
time there's a lot of monolithic

79
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:04,590
applications so if you were to go on to

80
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,230
dub dub dub hulu.com at the time you're

81
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:10,190
practically touching one to two rails

82
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:13,200
apps they're gigantic rails applications

83
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:15,359
and as a service there was free video

84
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,030
on-demand which was very ad heavy you

85
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,130
create account get blasted with ads and

86
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,989
then there was a subscription video on

87
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:24,030
demand which would essentially monthly

88
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:27,930
cost and then it was slightly less ad

89
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:31,080
blasting at the time so yeah then some

90
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,790
of the goals that we laid out for this

91
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,230
were these are a little bit more soft

92
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,560
again this is there was nothing in place

93
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:40,380
no focus on application security at all

94
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,880
outside of you know people were smart

95
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,140
engineers and cared about the product

96
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,900
and feature that features they were

97
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,339
releasing so some of the first things

98
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,140
we're just learning the lay of the land

99
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,079
really and just figuring out what the

100
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:54,208
most critical workloads were for the

101
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:56,420
business and for hulu overall you can

102
00:03:54,209 --> 00:04:00,180
imagine things like our signup flow ad

103
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:02,700
playback content playback authentication

104
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:06,000
things of that nature figuring those out

105
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,649
focusing on finding risk and

106
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,959
vulnerabilities in those critical

107
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,370
workloads that we mentioned and

108
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,709
establishing relationships with some of

109
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:17,070
the dev leads and team tech leadership

110
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:18,478
to again just create a relationship with

111
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,099
these people as we're working through

112
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,770
and helping them kind of secure their

113
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,240
applications and services so some of the

114
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,240
actions we take again a little bit more

115
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,740
software we started

116
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,180
getting towards that towards an a little

117
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,710
bit more technical work met with dev

118
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,569
leads and tech leads and just you know

119
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,008
stated the purpose of what the team was

120
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:36,020
what the program was what we're trying

121
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:38,150
to do and how we can possibly how we can

122
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:40,818
help them out while they're building and

123
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:43,219
scaling their services we learned

124
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:44,750
architecture of the services again of

125
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,599
those critical workflows primarily

126
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:50,120
figuring out what's applications and

127
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:51,199
services that you would touch when

128
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,259
you're going through some of those

129
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,120
critical workflows that we mentioned

130
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:57,560
then from there we focused manual and

131
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,169
automated security testing on those

132
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:03,110
critical workflows and again as I

133
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:06,530
mentioned before at that time it was one

134
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,759
application security hire and I was the

135
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,469
first person shaking the tree on

136
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,050
vulnerabilities on the application level

137
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:13,520
so you can think a lot of stuff came out

138
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,320
and you know to be honest a lot of it

139
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,940
was low-hanging fruit so one of the

140
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,710
first things we did was we acquired some

141
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,979
best tool that would find those things

142
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:23,960
they're a little bit easier to identify

143
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:25,490
and automate away things like cross-site

144
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,960
scripting cross-site request forgery

145
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,490
things of that nature

146
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,250
so then we can focus on doing more

147
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:32,659
manual testing business logic abuse

148
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:36,470
testing in some of those critical

149
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:39,530
workflows and some of the lessons

150
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:41,150
learned like I said at the desk tool

151
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:43,099
that we had was finding low-hanging

152
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,599
fruit it wasn't finding very intelligent

153
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:48,849
things but you know that was kind of

154
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:50,570
doing this job at the time and

155
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:52,280
establishing some of those relationships

156
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:54,530
with the development leads of the time

157
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,388
was very valuable created feedback loops

158
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:58,520
of you know just setting up sinks

159
00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:01,430
monthly bi-weekly or even quarterly

160
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,750
super useful at the time for us and I

161
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,219
still have some of those connections for

162
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,590
folks that still work at Hulu so it's

163
00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:08,090
been really valuable to just know what

164
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,859
they're working on they'll ping our team

165
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,840
and say hey we have concerns about this

166
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,210
this product or feature can you check it

167
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,659
out and just again it's a great way to

168
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:19,729
just be viewed as collaborators and not

169
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:21,490
that team that's just walking here's a

170
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:24,169
list of owner abilities go fix it I'm

171
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:26,199
the type of just spewing out reports

172
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:28,310
obviously that's not a very good

173
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:31,550
relationship to have with a development

174
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:34,219
team and justice I small smaller note

175
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,539
success criteria has changed a lot you

176
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:38,509
know we still go through and pick tool

177
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:40,429
tools and reevaluate solutions

178
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:44,149
I think at the time for us when it was

179
00:06:40,429 --> 00:06:46,758
the program was brand new it was a heavy

180
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:49,399
focus on automation and no configuration

181
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:51,439
I just give me a URL just test it I

182
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:54,139
don't want to spend my time configuring

183
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:56,119
scanning tools for you know hours on end

184
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:57,889
for a scan profile for some desk tool

185
00:06:56,119 --> 00:07:00,649
that's gonna give me a few more

186
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:03,769
exorcists you serve when I'd rather be

187
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:06,199
trying to find logical issues with again

188
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:12,979
critical workflows it's just a lot more

189
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:14,739
important so the next phase next

190
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:17,839
loser-face was the expansion phase

191
00:07:14,739 --> 00:07:20,779
naming it 2015-2016 for us vaguely

192
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:22,339
somewhere in those two years some of the

193
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:24,499
landscape at the time just kind of again

194
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:27,589
explaining what was there what's what

195
00:07:24,499 --> 00:07:29,589
we've been doing we're now familiar with

196
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:33,019
a lot of the critical apps and services

197
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:34,759
we've identified and mitigated some

198
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:36,319
immediate risk we found some issues when

199
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:37,809
it we've been able to automate away some

200
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,739
of the lower hanging fruit

201
00:07:37,809 --> 00:07:42,259
vulnerabilities and detecting those

202
00:07:39,739 --> 00:07:43,578
where the security go to for a few teams

203
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:46,999
which is great again having those

204
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:48,889
relationships for us we were in the one

205
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:50,869
to two actually I think was two point

206
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:53,119
five apps tech engineers at the time

207
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:56,089
some of these part-time helping us out

208
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:57,499
triage them some findings and we have a

209
00:07:56,089 --> 00:08:01,999
baseline scanning tool just trying to

210
00:07:57,499 --> 00:08:04,279
find some again mohan fruit lance war

211
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:06,139
landscape for hulu teams started to move

212
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:08,149
to development teams started moved to

213
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:10,879
more micro service architecture around

214
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:13,279
this timeframe so those major monolithic

215
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,169
applications that we had started teams

216
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:18,199
started pulling functionality from those

217
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:20,089
and then creating micro services to pull

218
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:22,549
that out so you know with a team didn't

219
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:24,559
want to they want to change chunks from

220
00:08:22,549 --> 00:08:26,628
some functionality of a an application

221
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:29,360
they didn't have to deploy this entire

222
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:31,729
monolithic multi million rails lines of

223
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,769
code for rails compared to just one

224
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:36,229
Python app that's a couple hundred lines

225
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:37,578
or something with story so and as a

226
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:40,219
service we got rid of ephod that

227
00:08:37,578 --> 00:08:42,620
disappeared subscription video on demand

228
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:44,870
same same product and we added no ads

229
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:47,990
for subscription video on demand as well

230
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:51,320
and we started adding some add-ons

231
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:53,810
at the time around that time frame some

232
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,550
of the goals for this process were to

233
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,839
create we started creating tools to

234
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:00,290
automate some of these processes and

235
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:01,520
vulnerability identification expanding

236
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:04,370
some of the tool coverage we mentioned

237
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,020
before and security giving security into

238
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,820
the SDLC because a lot of what we were

239
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:10,699
doing at the time was just looking at

240
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:13,040
the external production surface that we

241
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,930
that we had out there and beginning to

242
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,290
do some secure code education time as

243
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:20,120
well so here's something actions we took

244
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:22,430
during that time frame we acquired a

245
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,560
rest tool and we integrated it into one

246
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:25,729
of our those monolithic applications

247
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,140
they're still there again it was

248
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,330
minimizing being some of the

249
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:32,270
functionalities pulled out of it

250
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:35,029
integrated there was doing some analysis

251
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:37,060
on and protections against things like

252
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:39,380
cross side scripting sequel injection

253
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:42,050
cross-site request forgery stuff like

254
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,610
that we also start a bug bounty program

255
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:46,099
at the time I know this is kind of

256
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:47,510
arguable for a few programs for when

257
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,770
they should start bug bounty programs

258
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:50,899
how they should do it

259
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:53,529
we started rather early and we had like

260
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:56,630
wanted to AB SiC engineers at the time

261
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:58,750
but we took it very slow kept it private

262
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:01,279
it's actually still private to this day

263
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:03,230
but since then you know we started like

264
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,760
five to ten researchers and that really

265
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:07,160
helped us augment a lot of that manual

266
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:09,189
testing and we found a lot of severe

267
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,540
issues that came out of that program

268
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:15,260
that would have required a lot of manual

269
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:16,670
testing again no need to rush into it

270
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,380
regardless of what vendors trying to

271
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:20,300
push you to go public just to get that

272
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:23,240
brand name up there but side vendor

273
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,729
grant we started building some tools

274
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,589
like I said to identify vulnerabilities

275
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:30,020
and then also automate away some of the

276
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:32,959
spot-checking we were doing at the time

277
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:35,060
for discovering vulnerabilities so one

278
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,979
of those tools that we wrote we created

279
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,689
a tool for automatic say code analysis

280
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,980
for those rails apps again it was still

281
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:43,339
a decent amount of coverage at the time

282
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:45,680
so we used leverage break man the open

283
00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:48,670
source a code analysis tool and we

284
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:52,250
created a system that would listen to

285
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:53,839
get hooks and anytime a code code was

286
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:57,020
pushed to a rails app it would listen

287
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,970
clone it down run the scan and save the

288
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:01,089
results off into a database that we had

289
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:03,100
locally for this

290
00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:07,889
this service breaky break we're calling

291
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:10,990
it at the time and we would actually

292
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:12,910
notify developers of you know who was

293
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:15,249
ever the author on that commit to say

294
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:16,689
either depending on if they introduce

295
00:11:15,249 --> 00:11:19,660
new vulnerabilities or they reduce

296
00:11:16,689 --> 00:11:21,040
vulnerabilities we would email them and

297
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,809
tell them like hey great job you

298
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,399
remediated like five vulnerabilities

299
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:26,350
awesome or hey maybe check out this

300
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,160
commit because you just sent a sequel

301
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:31,839
injection out to production oops

302
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,969
seven notifications so we also built and

303
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,529
I'm gonna hop in some just show a little

304
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:38,259
bit of the tooling that we built as well

305
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:40,360
a lot of the other stuff was either you

306
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:42,129
know at the time trying to automate some

307
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,769
of the manual testing we were doing or

308
00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:46,930
monitoring our external surface that was

309
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:48,459
at this point very much changing as

310
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:50,529
teams were creating new micro-services

311
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:52,388
there were the external surface for Hulu

312
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:54,459
was changing pretty constantly and you

313
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:56,980
know nobody selling a security team

314
00:11:54,459 --> 00:11:58,420
obviously at that time so we built

315
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,759
something to monitor the external

316
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:03,099
surface we also built something tomorrow

317
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:04,480
of TLS health and grade and quality of

318
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,120
the configurations that were going out

319
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,889
at the time and also we had one or two

320
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,089
issues with s3 so we created the

321
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:11,769
monitoring tool for that as well

322
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:14,589
checking for very loose configurations

323
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:15,970
in access control we also helped some

324
00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:18,129
secure ducts for the security code

325
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:19,870
education so we're able to pull metrics

326
00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:22,540
from things like our bug bounty program

327
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,829
from our desk tool and tie that back to

328
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,269
certain teams that we knew we're

329
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:27,040
introducing cross-site scripting a

330
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:29,079
little bit more than others and we're

331
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,699
able to sit down and just a quick talks

332
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:35,410
with them to go over you know what these

333
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:36,998
issues are how to fix those things and

334
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,350
you know I was really useful because

335
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:39,670
again it created more feedback loops

336
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,749
that you didn't have before when a whole

337
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:43,839
development team sitting and they

338
00:12:40,749 --> 00:12:45,490
listened to to the security team tell

339
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,199
them about these issues and say hey this

340
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:49,660
is a real-world situation we're running

341
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:54,069
through these right now so the time is a

342
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:57,069
little bit more ad hoc excuse me so I

343
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:59,439
made this a little bit just some of the

344
00:12:57,069 --> 00:13:01,719
entries we talked about if you have any

345
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:03,040
further questions afterwards but this

346
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,920
was our app that we built for monitoring

347
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,050
external applications so internally we

348
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,719
have a platform as a service system that

349
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:12,250
developers provide code to code to just

350
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,050
like kind of almost like a Heroku and

351
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,430
they get infrastructure and

352
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,140
their app is running on infrastructure

353
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:20,380
they ought to worry about

354
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:22,569
so this hooked into that and also our

355
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:25,360
load balancers to see whenever a new

356
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:27,310
external VIP was created to try to tie

357
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,470
it back to an application that existed

358
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:31,060
on that past service so I'm not sure

359
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:33,070
I'll read these off you guys can read

360
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:35,050
them too much but so we are actually

361
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:36,910
able to talk to a few different API is

362
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:39,750
pull what domains were associated with

363
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:42,430
those applications so we have domains

364
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,930
the name of the past system so then name

365
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:46,899
of the application in the past system

366
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:48,849
what VIPs and wearable pull from a few

367
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:50,529
different sources get team owners dev

368
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:52,600
owners which is really important for us

369
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:54,279
with who find issues and we're able to

370
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,410
easily go back and say hey this is the

371
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:58,810
app and team owner let's go talk to talk

372
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:00,699
to them to go fix those issues when we

373
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:02,199
first found it whether or not our Web

374
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,959
Application Firewall was in front of it

375
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:07,899
also and we're a little pull some things

376
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:12,430
like weekly average requests per second

377
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:14,140
and you know the average and also the

378
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:15,640
backend count as well to say like you

379
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:18,010
know this is a change if we want to

380
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:20,110
enable a laugh on this application

381
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:22,000
are we actually having to do redeploy

382
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:23,890
for something that has 50 backends or is

383
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,920
it just like one to two which is a

384
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:29,439
pretty big difference obviously so and

385
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,360
this led us to got us a lot of different

386
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,520
a lot of good metrics from this this

387
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,959
platform like we're able to say again

388
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,880
look at something like language

389
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,199
distribution and say you know well what

390
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,329
was this what is this language

391
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:43,570
distribution that apparently more than

392
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:46,870
60% of the teams are using should we be

393
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:50,260
focusing on doing secure code education

394
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:52,959
or tooling for say this is Python for us

395
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:54,939
it might be at this point for Python

396
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,069
rather than why are we wasting our time

397
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:59,140
looking at job applications and it's

398
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:02,110
just a certain sliver like a few percent

399
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:04,600
percentage points so it drove us again

400
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:06,550
to be able to ask these focus questions

401
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:10,829
and focus and drive some of our product

402
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:10,829
products or projects a little bit more

403
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:16,000
so this is another one that's also

404
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:18,070
monitoring external surface we nicknamed

405
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,990
it how's my TLS so it's almost kind of

406
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:23,800
this a little bit it's pretty similar it

407
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:26,020
was just pulling off our our subdomains

408
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,430
or domains are externally facing to the

409
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:29,220
world

410
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:30,510
popping over to SSL labs comm if you

411
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,310
guys are familiar with it it just gives

412
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:34,649
a grading of how good a TLS

413
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:37,319
configuration is what protocols and

414
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:39,870
ciphers are in use so really that's all

415
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,460
this system was and would just throw all

416
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,500
the domains over the SSL labs that we're

417
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:45,450
applicable give us a grade back out and

418
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,520
again I muted some of the information we

419
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:51,720
had a similar distribution kind of like

420
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:54,959
this with protocols and protocols and

421
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,220
grades as well so there's I think some

422
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,649
somewhere in a hundred plus but give us

423
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,690
a holistic view of you know at the time

424
00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:02,700
TLS termination was happening in a lot

425
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:04,950
of different locations it wasn't really

426
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:07,680
just solidified out well you know for us

427
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:09,270
was on the CDN this TLS being terminate

428
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,620
out of the CDN is on the load balancers

429
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:12,390
it's somewhere else some other piece of

430
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:15,089
hardware so we're able to dig in and say

431
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:16,949
oh great times an eight but there's some

432
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:19,350
other ones that aren't so great why is

433
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:20,490
that again to drive those questions

434
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,930
wherever the pull those metrics and

435
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:24,950
drive those questions and initiatives to

436
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:27,029
go dig into well why are our NetScaler

437
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:29,070
configurations so terrible compared to

438
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:30,990
something that's on Akamai and is it

439
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:33,300
missing a standard we could created a

440
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:35,970
standard for TLS from there as well and

441
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,949
I've been pushing that a bit so it's

442
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,810
been useful for us getting more muted

443
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:41,670
stuff apologies for that but just given

444
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:43,529
that the high level of another tool we

445
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:45,390
created for you know from our bug bounty

446
00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:47,160
program again pulling metrics from these

447
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:49,170
different tools we kept running into

448
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,660
issue one or two issues with loose

449
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:53,670
configurations on s3 buckets which our

450
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:56,459
team did not want to keep paying for for

451
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:57,930
bug bounty programs it's pretty

452
00:16:56,459 --> 00:17:00,750
frustrating so we created a tool to

453
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:02,609
automate that and off the bottom again

454
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:04,230
it's just named the buckets what the

455
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:08,220
readwrite what teams had readwrite on

456
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:10,050
those buckets and you know what type of

457
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,730
access was a global readwrite wasn't

458
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:14,780
just certain teams so then it would this

459
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:17,370
would proceed to just alert us go an s3

460
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,839
API check all the buckets get these

461
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,159
permissions and if there was something

462
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:22,879
that we deemed a little bit more loose

463
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,530
in messages somebody on the App SEC

464
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,309
Channel so a little bit more shadow ops

465
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:32,100
type of tool there so going back some of

466
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:33,540
the lessons we learned for us the RAF's

467
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,860
tool and again i wanted to keep this a

468
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,389
little bit more honest i want to sit

469
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:39,139
here saying how great everything is

470
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:40,940
we've done because it's not

471
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,730
for us the rest tool integration we did

472
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:45,440
was a very high effort of integration

473
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:47,050
from the security engineers and from the

474
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,220
development engineers our development

475
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:51,919
developers as well for getting it

476
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:53,960
slotted doing the testing and for our

477
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,190
team to manage the infrastructure that

478
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,200
was supporting it nan de lying

479
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:59,150
infrastructure supporting it so that we

480
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,850
scrapped that it wasn't one of the

481
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:03,710
monolithic rails applications and as it

482
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:06,530
kind of did not help that we were going

483
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:08,540
to more micro service architecture so it

484
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:11,720
was only covering a certain chunk that

485
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:13,399
was getting minimized over time so that

486
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,050
didn't work for us we scrapped it sure

487
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,450
works for other people very well but at

488
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:19,820
the time it didn't work looking like I

489
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:21,440
went over monitoring tools we've

490
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:23,929
primarily focused on creating stuff that

491
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,150
automated way mameul spot-checking that

492
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:29,240
security engineers we're doing for

493
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:31,160
certain issues and also a way for us to

494
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,620
track external surface so we can drive

495
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:36,140
gather metrics and drive initiatives and

496
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:38,209
focus things focus things for our team

497
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:39,800
and for us a bug bounty program was an

498
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:41,270
immediate return I mentioned before we

499
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,280
found a lot of good issues that were

500
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:45,680
helping us at the time with one to two

501
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:49,399
engineers helped us augment a lot of

502
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:51,620
that manual testing that we had and you

503
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,240
know we're to the point where it's still

504
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:55,010
ongoing we've been doing it for two to

505
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,950
three years and I think my advice would

506
00:18:55,010 --> 00:19:01,400
be just do it slow there's no reason to

507
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:03,440
go fast into it just because just to get

508
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:07,460
to the sake of saying you have a public

509
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:09,290
program and focus talks again I would

510
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:11,150
keep saying this because of how valuable

511
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:12,500
it is to have those feedback loops with

512
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,260
different teams especially as an

513
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:17,090
organization as growing features or more

514
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:19,220
features are coming out subscriber bases

515
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:20,480
or user bases are growing up new teams

516
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:23,390
could create a little time so it's good

517
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,600
to have those those feedback loops they

518
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:28,220
use that you established so the next

519
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,590
phase is a little bit more current this

520
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:32,240
says 2017 2018 down there so there's a

521
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,800
little bit more current day for you know

522
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,140
what we're trying to get to what we're

523
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,399
focusing on so this is a little bit more

524
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:39,410
applicable to what the current

525
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:43,550
environment is so we have three to four

526
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:45,440
epic engineers on the team right now our

527
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:48,020
teams are moving to more centralized see

528
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,210
ICD processes and workflows

529
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:52,700
everything's micro-service practically

530
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:53,840
now at this point the

531
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,070
there's a front-end that's talking to a

532
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,908
lot of different api's to talk to more

533
00:19:55,070 --> 00:20:01,309
AP is and downward it goes and for in I

534
00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:04,789
mean for instance a quick stat that past

535
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:06,230
system I mentioned before I think is

536
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:08,359
somewhere around multi thousand

537
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:10,909
applications there on there now it's not

538
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:13,428
all Prada Prada plication z-- but it

539
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:15,769
goes to show that they've been there's a

540
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:19,850
lot of usage of smaller applications

541
00:20:15,769 --> 00:20:23,269
that only do certain things and as far

542
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:25,158
as hula went pretty similar s pod no ads

543
00:20:23,269 --> 00:20:28,009
subscription video on demand more

544
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:30,769
add-ons as well as now we have a live TV

545
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:33,919
service as well which was released

546
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:35,509
during this timeframe 2017 2018 so some

547
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,249
of the goals some some of the things we

548
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:39,259
try to change focus on a little bit more

549
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:41,529
now we're in a more maturing program is

550
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:43,609
to Remini classes vulnerabilities

551
00:20:41,529 --> 00:20:46,279
classes of vulnerabilities again not

552
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:47,869
trying to fix every XSS that's ever

553
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:49,609
occurred rather than starting a question

554
00:20:47,869 --> 00:20:51,830
well why is this occurring is it a

555
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:54,408
framework issue the tech issue is an

556
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:56,359
education issue okay we should be able

557
00:20:54,409 --> 00:20:58,669
to pull some metrics from our tooling to

558
00:20:56,359 --> 00:21:02,090
to be able to drive drives like some of

559
00:20:58,669 --> 00:21:03,289
the projects to fix those or things

560
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:04,759
they're or blood risks and things

561
00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:07,309
they're affecting you know maybe all

562
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:09,139
subscribers and compared to maybe

563
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:12,049
certain smaller amounts or subsets of

564
00:21:09,139 --> 00:21:13,939
subscribers in certain instances getting

565
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:15,590
security further in the SPLC like I said

566
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:18,470
we didn't get super far at this point up

567
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:20,209
until up until this point internal team

568
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:22,039
efficiencies you know it was a very

569
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:23,480
small team spinning in circles a lot so

570
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:25,908
there wasn't a lot of formal processes

571
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,919
we started get reeling those in a

572
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:30,019
formalizing security education as well

573
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:34,129
something that we kind of focused on for

574
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:35,929
this this phase some of the actions we

575
00:21:34,129 --> 00:21:38,149
took so we acquired a static analysis

576
00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:40,489
tool bigger vendor Enterprise one

577
00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:42,168
because that rails one we built as I

578
00:21:40,489 --> 00:21:45,200
said we went to more micro services

579
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:48,230
rails those at a gigantic applications

580
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,720
went away so we did an integration into

581
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:55,519
our CI CD pipelines that we were

582
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:57,200
matching before and it was something

583
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:58,730
that we required us who want created an

584
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,440
onboarding process with the aim of

585
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:02,359
trying to minimize the effort for the

586
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,309
development teams and just being able to

587
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:06,010
have a sheet of saying these are the

588
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:08,649
steps you need to do to integrate

589
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:10,720
into your pipeline and you know what the

590
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:12,790
expectations are so one thing that

591
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,320
really helped us with this was finding a

592
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:16,750
vendor that was able to provide some

593
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,820
level of triage for us on the front end

594
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:21,490
and really formalizing that process

595
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:24,159
throughout helped and I think I think

596
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:25,870
we'll talk about it as a return some of

597
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,970
the other things security involvement

598
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:29,168
into other team's processes that already

599
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:31,150
there we're kind of looking into

600
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:34,510
processes so this one specifically was

601
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:37,720
our develop their DevOps team had a

602
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:39,129
process for when somebody would request

603
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,690
for an application to get exposed

604
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:42,580
externally we kind of hooked in that

605
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:44,049
said hey let's you know gather some

606
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:46,030
information do a little security

607
00:22:44,049 --> 00:22:47,740
assessment on it quick

608
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:51,330
and get some spot checking before it

609
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:54,250
goes out and at this time we also

610
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:56,350
acquired a wave solution get to that

611
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:59,110
more detail and acquired some education

612
00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:00,699
content and put it into an eternal LMS

613
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:03,729
her learning management system that Hulu

614
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:05,169
had at the time and we started playing

615
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:09,100
around with contest security policy and

616
00:23:05,169 --> 00:23:10,780
production which was also definitely

617
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,340
definitely interesting but to going back

618
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:14,200
to the point of what we're able to build

619
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:16,330
from the external exposure process so to

620
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,929
give more context like I said a team

621
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:22,030
would go on to JIRA requested ticket

622
00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:23,620
saying I need a VIP to expose my marker

623
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:25,510
servers out to the Internet we're like

624
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:27,280
Oh might as well throw it over to us as

625
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:29,020
well so instead we kind of flipped it

626
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,399
and said it's whenever you need

627
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,710
something exposed just go on this

628
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,299
checklist fill out a few things and some

629
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:36,220
of the things we listen here are secure

630
00:23:34,299 --> 00:23:38,440
code educate or secure coding best

631
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,850
practices to give us more context of how

632
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,790
the application was developed in time

633
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:46,090
were they thinking of certain issues or

634
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:47,950
vulnerabilities and it would helped

635
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:49,120
gather a lot more context you know if it

636
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:51,280
was something that was like a marketing

637
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,850
page that was going out static page we

638
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,559
don't care

639
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:56,500
will instantly pass it by something

640
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:57,940
where they're saying false on these

641
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,290
things and saying they're not falling as

642
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:01,330
best practices maybe we should take a

643
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:05,559
look at that a little bit more in-depth

644
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:07,720
before it goes up so some of the lessons

645
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:09,760
learned here the SAC of analysis was

646
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,980
very valuable again I pushed security

647
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,330
presence further into the SDLC and I got

648
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:15,309
a lot closer to the developers that we

649
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:17,590
were beforehand focusing on work that

650
00:24:15,309 --> 00:24:21,370
was in production

651
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:23,439
and again formalizing a process for that

652
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:25,689
those teams really helped out and so

653
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,000
just like throwing documentation over to

654
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:31,300
them obviously and being able to throw

655
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,100
them get them on a very formalized

656
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:36,190
process really helped at this point I

657
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:37,810
think we've on-boarded it's around 30 40

658
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:39,040
applications they're all scanning in the

659
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,179
pipeline now so it's still work in

660
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,510
progress but it's something that's been

661
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:45,520
really valuable for us hooking into

662
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:47,950
established processes it was a lot of

663
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,510
for lower friction interactions compared

664
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:52,360
to us going out and saying hey we have

665
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:53,860
to you have to check everything by

666
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,959
security beforehand which isn't a great

667
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:57,129
ask everybody's not gonna be too excited

668
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,300
compared to just hooking in something

669
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:00,520
that was already there doing a quick

670
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:03,820
spot check getting some context before

671
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:05,620
behind the applications as well we

672
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:07,480
formalized some assessment processes

673
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:09,580
like I mentioned that one beforehand the

674
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:12,400
external exposure one we have one or two

675
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:14,879
teams essentially just created some work

676
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,840
queues and created some on calls for

677
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,390
application security engineers to say

678
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:21,790
hey for the weak handle the queues for

679
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:25,120
assessments or handle our bug bounty

680
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:27,250
triaging so so one person wasn't sitting

681
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,290
there for months on end arguing with bug

682
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:31,270
bounty researchers for being paid and a

683
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:33,280
obscene amount of money for cross-site

684
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:36,490
scripting or something of this sort so

685
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:37,750
we don't want a burn out there for us

686
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:39,880
that web integration I mentioned was a

687
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:43,000
high return we were able to get it get

688
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:45,400
it into a good integration as I

689
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,230
mentioned before that pass system we are

690
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:51,720
able to get it work with our DevOps team

691
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:51,720
to enable a one-click deployment for the
