00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,049
all right everybody thanks for coming

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:06,150
this is the beginner's guide to ICS how

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:08,250
to never sleep soundly again with Daniel

traditional vulnerability assessment

9
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:18,779

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:29,670
and other roles with intelligence

16
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,488
community partners businesses and local

17
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:36,890
governments please welcome to a deshaun

18
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:36,890
con 2018 thank you

19
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,920
I always hate to hear the bio at the

20
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:48,239
first because you're just like Mike stop

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:53,670
talking about anyway all right so let's

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:56,578
kick this off basic interest slide yeah

23
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,410
we're going to go through this and part

24
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,969
of it will be dry I promise but the

25
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,370
reward is that you get to get the story

26
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:03,680
time at the end so just hang with me all

27
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,798
right

28
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:11,220
okay so Who am I as the intro stated

29
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,080
last name is boo Jer I always like to

30
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,580
get that out of the way first because I

31
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:19,439
have gotten every single variation

32
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:23,158
possible some that add extra letters to

33
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,729
a French name so for some reason it's 15

34
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,619
years a 90 now I have an update of that

35
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:30,509
12 spent of various security roles from

36
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:34,049
systems administration Network

37
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:36,900
administration log monkey to CM security

38
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,640
consultant now previously mentioned

39
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,650
spend time in the intelligence community

40
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,570
on both sides of the river doing fun

41
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:48,869
things fun for me maybe not so fun for

42
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:52,100
the people we were doing them too and as

43
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:54,810
I mentioned we I work at sakura-con now

44
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:59,219
if you need help we can help you secure

45
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:02,430
a comment all right so how did I even

46
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:06,360
start getting into this I left college

47
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:10,220
in 2003 and I took a job in Jefferson

48
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:12,480
Parish Louisiana and all my commute to

49
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,109
certain buildings across the river I

50
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,260
would

51
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:18,360
pass the various chemical plants

52
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:22,019
refineries pumping stations and

53
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,640
everything else along River Road as you

54
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:27,800
can see on the picture on the right the

55
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:30,750
only thing that's separating a car going

56
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:33,060
55 miles per hour straight into a

57
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:36,510
fractionating column is that wonderful

58
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:41,040
chain-link fence with green plastic

59
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:46,440
across and this was like right after a

60
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,790
curve so I always will drive by and

61
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,040
sometimes in traffic and we sit there

62
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:53,370
and look at this and go how is this safe

63
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,679
how how did the people who built this

64
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:59,940
think that this was a bright idea to put

65
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,010
all of this right next to a road then I

66
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,579
kind of got another job so I didn't

67
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:10,609
worry about it anymore

68
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:13,200
so how did I get back into it um so I

69
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:15,030
parlayed a few things went to a few

70
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,070
startups decide the startup culture is

71
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:20,459
not for me it's for you awesome you can

72
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:22,170
make a lot of money not for me and when

73
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:23,670
I started my job and one of the things

74
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:25,890
that attracted me to my company was the

75
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,570
fact that we do ICS Skater work and it

76
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:29,609
was like awesome that sounds cool I

77
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:33,000
haven't been involved in that before and

78
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:36,019
I asked my boss at the time so my boss

79
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,660
actually do you have any white papers or

80
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:44,519
like official sakura-con documentation

81
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:46,950
for like introduction to ICS stuff no

82
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,530
the answer was no we have nothing here

83
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:51,899
are the NIST guides here are the

84
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,489
protocol things here's a couple of other

85
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,769
things that a few other people have

86
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:58,590
written by the way if you have trouble

87
00:03:55,769 --> 00:04:01,640
sleeping I highly recommend the NIST

88
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:03,209
guide to securing ICS systems it's

89
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:07,350
fascinating reading

90
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:09,420
utterly fascinating and so I decided hey

91
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:11,459
if I've got to learn this I'll hopefully

92
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,500
do somebody else a favor in the future

93
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:18,060
and they don't have to worry about

94
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:23,340
reading a NIST god so we're gonna get

95
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:25,870
over that intro and start with ICS what

96
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:28,270
exactly we're talking about

97
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:33,280
any system designed to allow maximum

98
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:34,810
control over a complex environment not

99
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,369
gonna read the slide to you basically

100
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,800
it's designed to take humans out of

101
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:42,729
situations where they could either be

102
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:46,449
dangerous cannot react fast enough or

103
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:47,830
can't just be there you'll find these

104
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:51,040
systems on the bottom of the ocean

105
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:53,198
you'll find the systems next to highly

106
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:57,460
toxic environments you'll find these

107
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:59,410
systems inside of barrels of chemicals

108
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:04,388
that will dissolve a human body if it

109
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:07,090
falls into it that's designed like I

110
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:10,870
said to take humans out of these types

111
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:12,669
of situations which also poses a problem

112
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:16,350
when we have to secure them because how

113
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:16,349
do you secure a device you can't touch

114
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:26,080
they also take measurements proportional

115
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:30,219
integral derivative various types of

116
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,750
mathematical amounts velocity any type

117
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,460
of system that were a type of

118
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:36,550
measurement that would be useful in a

119
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:39,960
process or a measurement or anything

120
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:43,300
like that would be these types of things

121
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,549
binary and analog everyone's relatively

122
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,500
familiar with that hopefully if you're

123
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,820
here at a hacker conference you

124
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,510
understand the difference between binary

125
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:59,200
and analog it's not raise your hand no

126
00:05:52,510 --> 00:06:01,389
okay great yeah that's basically that

127
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:05,400
the different types of process that we

128
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:07,780
get into discrete widgets license plates

129
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:10,388
different types of things like that

130
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:14,070
pretty much input comes in magic happens

131
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:20,139
output goes out you're left with this

132
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:22,180
batch processes yeah basically you use

133
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:23,889
this to make drugs to make food to make

134
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:27,130
anything that you would normally have a

135
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:31,210
set amount of input done and you have a

136
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:32,380
results from it continuous is kind of

137
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:37,030
where we start getting into water

138
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:39,130
treatment into power generation into you

139
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:43,090
know general types of things

140
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:47,469
require continuous output or input into

141
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:50,530
the process these can tend to be a

142
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:55,330
little bit more of the scarier ones just

143
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:56,979
because catastrophic failure is bad in

144
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:58,780
these types of environments like if you

145
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:01,090
have a new plant you don't want it to

146
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:03,489
melt down so your systems have to be

147
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:07,150
able to respond to and handle you know

148
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:09,220
radiation fuel outage water temperature

149
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:10,810
a lot of different things that we ought

150
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,310
that you all have to maintain and

151
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:15,100
measure while this is going on

152
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:18,970
constantly and then you're fighting the

153
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:22,510
point of no one really cares about

154
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:25,030
security or IT or OT as long as the

155
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:26,980
electrons flow that's all they care

156
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:29,770
about so when you have issues with the

157
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:31,540
security equipment the problem you run

158
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:33,430
into is the fact that oh well we have to

159
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,740
take it offline well that's not going to

160
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:39,520
happen because it takes a week to spin

161
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:42,190
back up and finally you have a hybrid

162
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:45,310
system air traffic control is the best

163
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:47,080
example of this you have regional

164
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:50,500
airports feeding into main airports you

165
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:55,000
have main air air routes across the

166
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:57,490
country you have constant collisions you

167
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,980
have to watch out for all of this is

168
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:03,220
basically what a hybrid system is this

169
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:04,930
can expand out it can contract in all

170
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:08,790
depends on the type of environment

171
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:08,790
weather different things like that and

172
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:14,230
then we have the general categories of

173
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,420
systems most people are familiar with a

174
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:22,170
dc-8 distribute controller or SCADA

175
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:22,170
that's a primary one you see around pcs

176
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:27,430
you'll see it in like food production

177
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,810
chemical production things like that

178
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:32,110
where there's a set process to monitor

179
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:36,340
through energy management and building

180
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:38,950
management a think HVAC think power

181
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,510
management power managing adjusting the

182
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:43,090
temperature of adjusting the temperature

183
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:44,439
down things like that and then safety

184
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:49,480
instrumented systems these are your

185
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:51,860
cut-offs these are your feed dumping er

186
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,570
dampers these are your flushing system

187
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,670
different things like that they're

188
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:57,860
designed entirely to make sure that if

189
00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:00,349
the system it is protecting gets out of

190
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:02,390
whack in any way it fails open or fails

191
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:07,850
close depending on the type and you're

192
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:11,930
done so how many people here have worked

193
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:15,050
with SCADA systems before a few it's

194
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:16,819
just like IT right yeah you're laughing

195
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:19,010
everybody who's work with is laughing of

196
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:21,140
course it's just like IT at least that's

197
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:23,720
what everybody who's hasn't worked with

198
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,010
ot or SCADA systems thinks it's

199
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:29,390
computers it's networking that's the

200
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:32,660
same thing right how many people here

201
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:34,699
have worked in regular IT yeah everybody

202
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:39,290
else how hard is it to buy a network

203
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:42,170
device trivial right plenty to choose

204
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:43,849
from multiple vendors different types of

205
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:45,860
price points everything you sing

206
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:48,890
everything you could possibly want same

207
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:51,740
thing for workstations right network

208
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:53,540
equipment you can pretty much go on

209
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,130
Newegg and buy whatever you want to

210
00:09:53,540 --> 00:10:02,020
stand up a network and do whatever you

211
00:09:55,130 --> 00:10:09,290
need to in a regular IT environment huh

212
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:11,689
well I mean yep I go right friggin the

213
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:21,530
Los Angeles County school system okay

214
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:28,250
that works too all right now there we go

215
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:32,150
all right for ot or ICS you really only

216
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:34,880
have a few things you only have the HMI

217
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:36,439
or the workstation data historian which

218
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,450
keeps tracks of all the data that's been

219
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,100
going on throughout the system and so we

220
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:42,500
can do comparison to measurements going

221
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,980
back and forth going backwards and past

222
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:47,540
and possibly using it to predict future

223
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:50,360
environments as well

224
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:53,420
various controls control amounts control

225
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:56,330
servers things like that where you know

226
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:59,650
it fails up in the fails clothes PLC's

227
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:59,650
all these different types of things

228
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:07,430
same thing with ot talked about the

229
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,599
workstation engineering stations are

230
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:11,420
usually designed more for the

231
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,760
controlling of the environment whereas

232
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:17,510
the HMI is designed more for monitoring

233
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,580
and then the PLC is also there starting

234
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:23,930
to blend more from their traditional

235
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:25,970
role of just having a discreet job PLC's

236
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:28,219
are becoming more robust to be able to

237
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:30,980
do a variety of things if you're willing

238
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:36,589
to pay for it that's usually the price

239
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:39,890
point same thing with the network

240
00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:43,880
equipment PLC you know RT is to limit

241
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:46,189
your unit all this is basically getting

242
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:49,670
to the point saying that ot and ICS

243
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:53,720
technology is similar to I T but it's

244
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:55,339
dissimilar enough to where it is would

245
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,700
be honest a kind of a pain in the ass to

246
00:11:55,339 --> 00:12:02,630
work with so it's older some of its

247
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:05,360
really very limited in scope as opposed

248
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:08,540
to magic boxes that you can go out and

249
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:14,630
buy for the latest IT Network this

250
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:16,459
you're kind of left with not a lot and

251
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:18,740
then you get to the different OSS I

252
00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:23,180
don't wants to marry with Windows Linux

253
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:27,800
Mac OS relatively easy to pick up

254
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:31,520
patched update theoretically then you've

255
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,839
got office any of Ireson heads a lot of

256
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:39,170
stuff that normally designed to protect

257
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:41,240
I team IT networks in these systems yeah

258
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:44,510
there's no McAfee for a real-time

259
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:47,600
operating system there's no host

260
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:49,520
intrusion system for this basically

261
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,680
you're dealing with busybox

262
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,819
on devices and even then that's a

263
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,819
stripped-down busybox

264
00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:02,839
if anything happens they fail like not

265
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,670
not gracefully no they just shut down

266
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:06,140
and they're done and then you have to

267
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:07,430
dispatch someone out in the middle of

268
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:10,209
nowhere to go figure out why the box

269
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:10,209
isn't working anymore

270
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:15,810
maintenance agreements basically tell

271
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,020
you you can't touch the equipment unless

272
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:20,520
you work for the vendor a lot of the

273
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,260
times what we'll end up seeing when we

274
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:29,370
go out on engagement is boxes that are

275
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:32,069
still running Windows XP or NT because

276
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:34,770
the vendor says nope you can't patch it

277
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:38,220
until we've tested the patch how many

278
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:40,800
people here rely on vendors to do their

279
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:44,940
patching for them like the operating

280
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,709
system vendor none can you imagine doing

281
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,560
that relying on a vendor to do your

282
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:55,440
patching for you is that a good idea or

283
00:13:49,560 --> 00:14:00,209
a bad idea okay which vendor would you

284
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:03,450
trust sir exactly yeah

285
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:06,540
and so the the popular versions that we

286
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:11,130
have are UNIX VxWorks and even Windows

287
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:14,610
CE II Microsoft decided to plan this

288
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:17,640
space and everyone is aware of the blue

289
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:20,030
screened ATM so the blue screamed if you

290
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:23,580
know walls and stuff like that

291
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:25,260
supposedly they've really kind of

292
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:27,780
hardened it for the certain types of ICS

293
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:29,730
environments I still giggle whenever I

294
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:33,300
walk by the LAX and there's a yet

295
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:38,250
another blue screen terminal because Wow

296
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:40,699
right great job guys um everyone's

297
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:48,480
familiar with the protocols you know

298
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:50,190
tcp/ip SSH security is built into a lot

299
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,350
of these protocols like encryptions

300
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:54,270
automatic like a quic protocol that

301
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:56,790
Google put out does its own encryption

302
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:59,520
without anything in providing a

303
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:01,949
certificate or anything like that you'll

304
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:04,860
see these pretty much everywhere and as

305
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:06,540
IT technology involves you're constantly

306
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,760
seeing this updated you're constantly

307
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:13,170
constantly seeing new ciphers as older

308
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:15,270
ones get broken nobody really cares if a

309
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:18,870
couple packets get lost on your on your

310
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:20,400
VoIP call nobody really cares if you

311
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:22,620
know you're watching a YouTube video and

312
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:27,600
you lose a couple packets here and there

313
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:31,560
stutters and it keeps going that's so

314
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,630
much with ot protocols these protocols

315
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:36,770
were designed when the internet was

316
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:40,380
still connected to three universities

317
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:42,689
and back then nobody ever would have

318
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:45,150
thought that somebody think would even

319
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:48,180
think it was funny much less malicious

320
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:52,949
to attack and a network based on a

321
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:54,689
protocol itself some people approached

322
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:56,880
it as simple design

323
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:59,850
I'd like to say Modbus is the window

324
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:02,820
licking ot protocol in the world because

325
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:05,450
it literally has four things to work

326
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:09,080
with and does everything else with that

327
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:11,730
it's amazingly complex for such a

328
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,750
ridiculously simple protocol because of

329
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:16,620
all the ways that they possibly

330
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:22,530
implemented those four ways essentially

331
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:24,180
which will see with Modbus is more of a

332
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:26,280
hub-and-spoke type of thing the masters

333
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:28,560
the hub broadcasts out all the slaves

334
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,300
tells me hey what's going you know send

335
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,849
me your value slaves respond back

336
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:37,469
sleeves usually don't respond until the

337
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:41,670
master tells them to Dean b3 went to the

338
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:43,230
other side of the spectrum and basically

339
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:46,310
gave you anything and everything you

340
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:48,990
could ever possibly want in a protocol

341
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:50,520
again some people think that that's the

342
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,710
best way to handle it some people would

343
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:56,310
prefer the simplicity of it

344
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:58,800
d3 is usually what the protocol is used

345
00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:02,280
for power generation you'll see that a

346
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,859
lot especially on transmission sites or

347
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:07,200
transformers a lot of the radio packet

348
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:11,810
radio stuff you'll see is carrying dnp3

349
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:14,160
traffic hopefully encrypted not always

350
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:16,530
so for any of the software radio

351
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,390
affection autos out there go look at the

352
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:23,040
go look at transformers and watch the

353
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:24,990
BMP 3 protocols go by I'm not going to

354
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,520
bore you with the details of this if

355
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:31,440
you're really interested there's the D

356
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:33,360
mp3 primer on the bottom a lot of these

357
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,280
can be encapsulated D mp3 can be

358
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:40,570
encapsulated with GPRS Wi-Fi software

359
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:45,220
that I mentioned earlier that's if the

360
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:47,470
equipment handles it some equipment we

361
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:49,510
actually have a client that we work with

362
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:52,740
that has the original equipment that

363
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:55,990
they install in their network in 1912 I

364
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:59,200
am not joking they have equipment from

365
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:01,810
1912 vacuum tubes and all still

366
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:06,130
installed running they're running their

367
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:07,600
equipment unfortunately have an NDA

368
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:09,820
because I would love to be able to share

369
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,129
that story with the pictures but they

370
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:14,639
tend to not want you know people knowing

371
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:16,900
that they're running equipment for 1912

372
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,380
snow we're in here it's nowhere in the

373
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:22,030
California I can tell you that much but

374
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:24,700
that goes to the point of how would you

375
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:28,450
get a piece of equipment from 1912 to

376
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:30,490
talk on a network can you imagine

377
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:34,720
has anyone seen that picture of like the

378
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:36,370
15 adapter like plug that they plug into

379
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,800
the back of like a parallel port into a

380
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:43,149
computer it looks like that I'm not

381
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:45,430
joking it is ridiculous but it works for

382
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:49,410
some strange reason and they just it's

383
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:52,180
not broke like why fix it it's working

384
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:54,070
because the vacuum tubes cost more than

385
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:59,620
the entire thing would be to replace but

386
00:18:54,070 --> 00:19:01,629
you know it's working and another thing

387
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:05,110
is is bad people understand these

388
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:07,030
protocols like mentioned software radio

389
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:08,679
people understand how software radio

390
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:10,450
works so if you're not in capsule if

391
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,040
you're not encrypting your dnp3 traffic

392
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:13,210
they can just replay it and do whatever

393
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,220
the hell they want with it

394
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:16,870
you know if you're not authenticating

395
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:20,290
the actual traffic if you don't have a

396
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:22,270
method to make sure that the traffic

397
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:24,700
that you think is secure actually is

398
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:31,210
secure people will crack it open like a

399
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:34,180
kitten in a shark tank and this is the

400
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:37,600
part where the vast majority of

401
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:39,670
differences are noticed the focus so I T

402
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,840
how many people will actually work for

403
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:46,090
technology companies yeah the technology

404
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,669
is your product right like you actually

405
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,750
will spend money on your technology to

406
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:54,900
develop your product

407
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:56,890
right of course that's your business

408
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,960
nonprofits can still be about making

409
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:00,970
money and depending on the nonprofit and

410
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,200
status of it they're more interested in

411
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:04,210
getting the message out they don't

412
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,940
really particularly care if they have it

413
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:08,620
patch their 2003 server because all it

414
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:14,040
does is send email and who would hack an

415
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:16,600
email server and for anybody who's cissp

416
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:20,379
come on you could admit you've got it

417
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:22,240
all right I have it - it's alright yeah

418
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:29,680
confidentiality is stressed over

419
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:32,770
integrity or availability oh yeah ot

420
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:36,340
focus as long as the bits flow no one

421
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:38,050
cares don't care if we get hacked as

422
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:40,389
long as we don't have to notify don't

423
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:41,590
care if we have to don't care if we have

424
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,540
to secure something unless we're

425
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:46,929
specifically told by government

426
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:49,330
regulations to do it as long as whatever

427
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:54,520
we sell keeps going that's all we care

428
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:56,560
about any dangerous processes are

429
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,240
conducted safely as possible again that

430
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,940
comes mostly from government regulation

431
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,280
more than from the kindness of the

432
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:06,520
business kindness of the heart of the

433
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,899
business it's usually also done as

434
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,820
efficiently as possible to make sure

435
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:13,810
that you're not wasting any inputs or

436
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:15,520
that you're wasting any time for ot

437
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:18,100
availability of stress moreover

438
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,840
integrity and confidentiality missing a

439
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:22,209
packet an OT environment can cause your

440
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,050
network to shut down it cause your

441
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:27,370
entire thing to fail open can cause

442
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:35,110
catastrophic damage in the environment

443
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:37,090
or to yourself and then downtime

444
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:40,209
isolates for critical systems and

445
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:41,980
processes five-nines what is it like six

446
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:43,870
or seven nines or something like that

447
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:46,810
that people have s always with of

448
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:51,939
they're willing to spend the money Uncle

449
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:54,370
Ed algae's are bad kind of like people

450
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,690
have dealt with D dollars of dying and

451
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:58,030
everything else and nobody can get to

452
00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:02,100
Facebook for a day you'll bitch about it

453
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:02,100
on Instagram but life goes on

454
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:12,179
not necessarily with this when you're

455
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:14,490
taking down a generator plant you plan

456
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:16,050
that because you're going to be down for

457
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:19,950
a week

458
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:22,020
a month doing what you need to do and

459
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:24,090
then if you've got a hurricane coming

460
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:27,210
your planned outage is not going to

461
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:28,649
happen because well a hurricane is

462
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:30,980
coming we have more important things to

463
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,980
worry about

464
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:41,429
when they're unplanned is where people

465
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:43,620
go bankrupt or people die or you have a

466
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:46,760
smoking crater in the ground where your

467
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:48,989
plant used to exist

468
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:52,110
kind of like the West Texas fertilizer

469
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:54,690
one I think is the one that blew up like

470
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:58,350
half of a freaking kiloton or something

471
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:59,340
like that generate whitepapers some

472
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:01,889
people will eventually write

473
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:04,139
dissertations on it your name will be

474
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:08,760
dragged through the mud and you don't

475
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:12,170
want that to happen kind of touched on

476
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:14,310
this earlier as far as procurement goes

477
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:16,890
depending on the regulation will differ

478
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:18,780
depend on your procurement if you're

479
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:20,370
subject to Newark sip you have very

480
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,960
specific guidelines over how your

481
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:25,139
equipment needs to be purchased and set

482
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:27,930
up and put into your network if you're

483
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:29,850
more of a HIPAA PCI type person as long

484
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:33,930
as they're compliant with that nobody

485
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:36,149
really cares you have some ability to

486
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:37,860
tweak and fine-tune and patch and yank

487
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:41,820
stuff out and put stuff in to your

488
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:45,990
heart's content and that's so much with

489
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:49,350
ICS I'd take there's like a handful of

490
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:51,240
vendors for this equipment and they all

491
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:53,939
collude with each other to make sure

492
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,370
that they don't interoperate so if you

493
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:58,740
buy Emerson you're an emerson shop if

494
00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:01,639
you buy Hitachi you're a hitachi shop if

495
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:04,200
you buy siemens you're a seaman shop

496
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,640
with the encapsulation of the protocols

497
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,500
you have a little bit of fluid a

498
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,140
fluidity with that now but not

499
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:14,280
necessarily as much as you would

500
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:15,420
appreciate kind of mentioned Newark sip

501
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:20,940
earlier you also have you

502
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:23,490
da FDA regulations you can maybe tweak a

503
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:26,160
few things add a box here take a box out

504
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:27,360
there if you do it for within the

505
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:33,780
service level agreements with your

506
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:35,429
vendor and honestly like a perfect

507
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:38,700
example this one of our clients not too

508
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:42,510
long ago asked us to come in and to test

509
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:44,910
the system and we have all set it off

510
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:47,250
got everything ready to go for the

511
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:49,140
morning coming in when we showed up in

512
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:51,900
the morning they told us we couldn't do

513
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:55,500
it and we're going what what did we do

514
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:56,880
we were fine before they contacted the

515
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,910
vendor to make sure that the vendor was

516
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,700
ok with us testing it the vendor is

517
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:05,550
basically had kittens and was said no no

518
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:09,030
you can't do that you'll bring down your

519
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:13,649
network and one to which we responded

520
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:15,629
with well not really I mean we're just

521
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:17,640
doing some scanning no no like you'll

522
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:20,940
you'll crash our devices we haven't

523
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:25,650
patched that yet well how long have you

524
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:28,950
known about it about a decade yeah

525
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:30,630
and it's the bigger fish to fry they

526
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:32,430
don't particularly care Siemens patched

527
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:35,520
their equipment after Stuxnet though it

528
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:37,020
was amazing how quick that happened what

529
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,030
happens when an international incident

530
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:42,320
makes the news you tend to force the

531
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:44,610
vendor to patch their equipment Oh

532
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,050
security we're all here we're out of

533
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:47,669
hacker conference we all generally know

534
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:55,590
how security works for the IT

535
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:56,390
environments y'all I want to cry

536
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:59,280
sometimes

537
00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:03,090
I'm not joking like sometimes I go back

538
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:09,780
to the hotel and I'm like what why what

539
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:13,379
why why it some of them they're just not

540
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:15,260
existent like tell Matt tell them that's

541
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:18,060
exposed on the Internet

542
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:19,740
well no it's not well yes it is because

543
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:21,330
your box is dual homed then to your IT

544
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,820
network and it hasn't been patched

545
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:25,649
either so when your VPN credential hops

546
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:27,629
in somebody's directly on your internet

547
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,750
from your internet connection directly

548
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:30,370
to the box

549
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,750
then they hop on this box and then

550
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:35,590
they're in your operational network

551
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:42,250
maybe tell that's not a good idea but it

552
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:46,990
works yeah well so does sandpapering off

553
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:48,850
a tattoo but nobody does that uh may

554
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:50,440
networks they just don't do security

555
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:52,179
they don't patch they don't upgrade

556
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,270
their network equipment they don't do

557
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:57,280
firmware upgrades they don't do anything

558
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:58,810
the the issue that a lot of people run

559
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,660
into with this is the people who run

560
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:02,110
these networks come from

561
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:05,020
telecommunications or come from

562
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:07,469
compliance or come from areas that are

563
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:10,389
not necessarily intimately familiar with

564
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:13,540
cyber security and security in general

565
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:19,720
so when you're trying to explain to an

566
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:22,360
old phone coms guy that having port 445

567
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:25,870
exposed on the Internet is generally a

568
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:28,840
bad idea he a you need to explain what a

569
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:31,659
port is being you need to explain why

570
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:36,250
four four five is important see you need

571
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:37,870
to also explain what it worm is and do

572
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:43,420
you hope that he just doesn't blow you

573
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:44,860
off and tell you to go away yeah I mean

574
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:46,390
it's like it's it's a very frustrating

575
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:47,800
as a security professional to come to

576
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:49,660
these environments a basically be told

577
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:55,350
that your entire job is pointless

578
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:59,710
because it works yeah it's great

579
00:27:55,350 --> 00:28:01,629
and again you saw how many people raised

580
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:03,490
their hands and that's just this room

581
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:05,650
alone there was what three four people

582
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:07,780
have worked with ICS equipment how many

583
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:10,750
people have you even seen what a siemens

584
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:15,220
controller looks like could you

585
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:17,170
recognize it in a room IOT part the the

586
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:19,780
IOT stuff is making that easier now but

587
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:22,480
like a siemens s7 would anybody know

588
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:24,450
what the hell that looks like should

589
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,680
that's what it was involved in Stuxnet

590
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:28,450
but yeah like nobody even knows what

591
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:32,130
this equipment looks like much able to

592
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:32,130
held a pen test and they were secure it

593
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:39,070
this didn't work okay this is the

594
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:41,050
feigning goat picture it's famous for it

595
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:42,220
like almost is required in every single

596
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:44,289
ICS 1b

597
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:48,340
literally when you scan a PLC it falls

598
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:51,280
over like a fainting gun okay

599
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:53,139
so we've kind of gone to the dry bits of

600
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,460
all this stuff and I apologize for it I

601
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:57,510
see a few of you kind of nodding your

602
00:28:54,460 --> 00:29:02,830
heads so that's that's fine

603
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:06,129
here's why this is all scary anybody

604
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:11,678
remember this does anybody read the

605
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:14,650
white paper on all of this yeah you

606
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:19,539
Russia screwed over Ukraine with this

607
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:22,750
like seriously they they kudos to Russia

608
00:29:19,539 --> 00:29:25,179
I'm sorry it wasn't Russia kudos to the

609
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:27,400
state-sponsored attacker who took down

610
00:29:25,179 --> 00:29:36,220
the Ukraine power grid in the middle of

611
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:38,230
December I always loved like reading the

612
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:40,840
after-action report from these types of

613
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:44,110
things because of course they got in

614
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:46,209
with spear fishing of course somebody

615
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:48,100
clicked on a spear phishing email

616
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:49,480
they've got black energy inside of the

617
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:52,418
original IT network

618
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:54,940
oh yeah no I love spear fishing it's

619
00:29:52,419 --> 00:29:57,309
awesome I go on hop on Facebook and be

620
00:29:54,940 --> 00:30:02,710

some people will click on it even dumb

624
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:11,980
stuff the best one I've seen so far it's

625
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:17,380
a big red button that says don't click

626
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:18,789
me you're laughing people click it they

627

or that Donald Trump is in jail click

632
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:39,820
here yeah lunch they started once they

633
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:41,110
got confounded control they started you

634
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,879
know doing the normal hacker thing

635
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:46,899
swiping that everything wasn't nailed

636
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:48,549
down found VPNs into the network of

637
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:53,080
course they did because they're always

638
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:55,179
on here's the part where it starts

639
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,899
getting really bad found engineering and

640
00:30:55,179 --> 00:30:59,730
process server

641
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:03,490
on the scheduled network don't duel home

642
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:06,220
devices on your ot network and your IT

643
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:08,620
network if you work and Skater here and

644
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:10,600
you work for any type of plant I swear

645
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:12,159
to God if I come to your work and

646
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,110
there's a dual homing device I'm gonna

647
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,400
look at you like you've sprouted a third

648
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:20,439
head and ask you what your major

649
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:23,940
malfunction is you laugh every client

650
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:26,320
engagement I find dual home boxes

651
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:29,680
they're not supposed to happen because

652
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:32,470
of Nick sir Nick Newark sips sorry about

653
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:36,370
that every time I find a dual home box

654
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:38,080
at least one can anybody tell me what a

655
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:40,679
good reason would be to have a dual home

656
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:53,530
box on these two types of networks

657
00:31:40,680 --> 00:32:00,640
that's one that's two come on yeah two

658
00:31:53,530 --> 00:32:04,540
and a half yeah no one's no one's got

659
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:07,690
the best answer of all of them okay

660
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:12,820
two and three-quarters it's always been

661
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:14,920
that way what do you say you're new

662
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:16,840
you're a fresh paste person coming into

663
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:19,270
this wonderful new IT Network and you're

664
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:21,429
like why is this box tool home to old my

665
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:28,450
new supervisor and what do they respond

666
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:31,750
with oh no always been that way it

667
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:34,710
probably a reason don't change it is it

668
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:37,450
documented who documents their network

669
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:40,960
is it patched we don't have time to

670
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:44,370
patch well how about I unplug it and see

671
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:50,050
who calls you no don't do that

672
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:51,610
yep Russians did they said ooh that

673
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:52,930
looks like a nice little target we're

674
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:55,479
just gonna sit here for a little while

675
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:58,840
and they'd load and observe for like six

676
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:00,400
months by the way how do you catch

677
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:03,600
people after they've been in your

678
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,600
network after six months

679
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:15,120
Oh hunting yes yes my favorite threat

680
00:33:07,649 --> 00:33:19,860
hunting mm-hmm with what do you have

681
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:21,928
logs from six months ago you're right

682
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:23,490
you're right it's entirely right does

683
00:33:21,929 --> 00:33:31,039
your organization have logs from six

684
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:31,039
months ago okay that's improvement then

685
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:38,429
yeah yeah most of the time a client will

686
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:42,000
keep logs for a month really good ones

687
00:33:38,429 --> 00:33:47,240
will keep it for three these people laid

688
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,240
low for six months yeah

689
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:56,070
so they disconnected all the substation

690
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:58,559
caused a major rack now if you really

691
00:33:56,070 --> 00:34:01,080
don't like your target you just turn off

692
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:05,460
and you like yep done we did a good job

693
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:07,320
not for the Russians they decided that

694
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,929
they were going to brick the ups at the

695
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:17,449
central office so when the power went

696
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:21,060
out the central office went out because

697
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:24,509
how are you going to respond if you

698
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:27,509
can't even maintain your systems it's

699
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:29,609
easy oh by the way they also installed

700
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:31,619
malware edge of the media converters

701
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:36,149
that brick the devices across the entire

702
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:40,820
network so like your fibre to Ethernet

703
00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:44,540
gone your dnp3 serial to Ethernet gone

704
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:48,570
Wireless to whatever Ethernet gone

705
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:53,009
everything just literally had to go out

706
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:57,570
hands touch boxes and replace it oh and

707
00:34:53,010 --> 00:35:02,330
they also DDoS the call center too yeah

708
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:05,369
this this was just bad horrible so

709
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:07,980
having said that this was probably the

710
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:11,400
worst example that I can probably think

711
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:13,560
of an in recent history of you know

712
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,790
things going on and this was in Ukraine

713
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:17,840
everyone knows Ukraine is still a

714
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:19,460
relatively developing country

715
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,530
I say that but they're really not

716
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:23,720
they're daring European country but they

717
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:26,210
have Russia to the as a neighbor so they

718
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:28,959
have issues but that doesn't happen here

719
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:31,130
right like nobody really remembers much

720
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:36,350
anything happening here a few things

721
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:40,810
here there really yeah good I got a

722
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:43,400
couple channels alright good uh yeah

723
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:49,520
how about screwing up the chemical mix

724
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:52,340
uh no drinking water this is 2016 not

725
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,670
too long ago sequel injection and

726
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,670
fishing

727
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:59,390
how many people have robust fishing

728
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:03,230
protections at their place of work

729
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:07,359
I mean people actually train their users

730
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:09,980
for fishing yeah I see like three hands

731
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:12,500
shame on you all

732
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:15,710
okay please make my job harder

733
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:17,600
I want I want a challenge please make my

734
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:19,760
job harder sending a phishing email is

735
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,110
basically shooting a fish and like a

736
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,480
fish market

737
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:26,510
not even in a barrel because some

738
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:30,470
because Nancy and accounting is going to

739
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:32,720
click it okay the CEO is going to click

740
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:34,459
it someone with someone will click the

741
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,560
big red button that says don't click me

742
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:38,690
I can assure you of that and then I'm at

743
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:47,090
or anybody else's in or Boris from

744
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:52,430
Bratislava is in alright so we do it I

745
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:54,080
give you my card at the end of it then

746
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:58,190
you're not having the proper motivations

747
00:36:54,080 --> 00:37:01,130
for your workforce I guarantee you a

748
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:02,840
Wall of shame can go a long way in

749
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:04,130
making sure your users pay attention to

750
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,350
their fishing fishing training

751
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:11,900
especially if their manager has to go to

752
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:13,430
them with it do that twice and make your

753
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:15,260
manager have to take time out of your

754
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:17,210
day to go to an hour long training on

755
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:20,720
what not to click on dumb emails see how

756
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:23,620
long you keep that job alright it's

757
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,620
those water treatment

758
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:29,900
this is my widow my favorite ones they

759
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:34,099
literally captured the commands being

760
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:36,950
given to this during a test one time saw

761
00:37:34,099 --> 00:37:40,780
the dnp3 traffic and then replayed it

762
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:43,939
everywhere in the entire city of Dallas

763
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:48,770
for how long was it I think it was like

764
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:53,660
a couple of hours of nothing but tornado

765
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:56,170
sirens going off for hours before they

766
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:58,578
could figure out what was going wrong

767
00:37:56,170 --> 00:38:02,930
life-threatening but damn sure annoying

768
00:37:58,579 --> 00:38:08,530
you know and would you like to be that

769
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:08,529
emergency management manager yeah

770
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:17,540
okay so two recent stories about this

771
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:20,149
types of issues um we had a utility

772
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:21,410
client who asked us to come in and test

773
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:26,450
their network and we're like awesome

774
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:28,460
great ok utility client decided look we

775
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:30,189
want you to come into our power plant

776
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:33,740
and we want you to test our equipment

777
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:36,260
for real not playing around we want you

778
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:39,828
to come in and test it for real if you

779
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:41,660
knock it over fine we will give you a

780
00:38:39,829 --> 00:38:45,349
get out of jail letter if you knock over

781
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:48,980
a power plant my coworker and I are like

782
00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:50,420
yes finally we get to kill a power plan

783
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:52,190
because we knew we were going to kill it

784
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:56,660
we knew it like that's going to happen

785
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:59,270
we will find a way so we set up and we

786
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:00,680
get told by the network manager at the

787
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:06,740
power plant you're not gonna be able to

788
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:07,399
get into a network will challenge

789
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:09,770
accepted

790
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:13,099
of course so we're like alright we'll

791
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:13,490
look um where's your switch doesn't

792
00:39:13,099 --> 00:39:15,410
matter

793
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:16,490
look I'll walk in there I'll plug it in

794
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:20,629
myself you're not going to get on the

795
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:24,368
network are you are you running 802 dot

796
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:24,369
o 1x what's that

797
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:31,609
the plot thickens okay so cowork and I

798
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:34,660
walk up we plug in fire up Wireshark and

799
00:39:31,609 --> 00:39:37,180
we see packets and we're like we thought

800
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:41,529
we couldn't get on the network

801
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:41,529
well yeah you're not on the network I

802
00:39:42,009 --> 00:39:46,160
see packets well yeah I mean you're

803
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:50,660
gonna see packets but that doesn't mean

804
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:53,538
you're on the network what does being on

805
00:39:50,660 --> 00:40:04,058

808
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:17,660
our network were you not aware that I

809
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:19,910
can manually assign an IP address to my

810
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:22,519
box and participate in your network like

811
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:25,670
I can even VLAN tagging if you want well

812
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:30,140

822
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:52,039
you know we'll go so we were supposed to

823
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:55,489
arrive at 8:30 the board of directors at

824
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:57,650
a meeting at 7:00 and all of a sudden

825
00:40:55,489 --> 00:40:59,660
the client who is Billy badass you could

826
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:02,440
knocked over our network we don't care

827
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:05,960
we'll take care of his like now hold up

828
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:09,400
wait wait hold on let's let's let's not

829
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:13,009
be too hasty with this come to find out

830
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:14,869
they thought that because they didn't

831
00:41:13,009 --> 00:41:17,210
have a DHCP server running on their

832
00:41:14,869 --> 00:41:18,710
network that that meant that I couldn't

833
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:22,069
that we couldn't get on their network

834
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:23,420
and do all the fun scanning stuff

835
00:41:22,069 --> 00:41:25,220
because they just thought that if they

836
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:26,630
just plugged up the ad you just see

837
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:28,459
backups but you couldn't send any

838
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:29,599
traffic on there so of course yeah sure

839
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:32,230
knock yourself out there you're not

840
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:34,759
going to get on there when we could and

841
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:37,450
they were already doing maintenance on

842
00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:37,450
one generator

843
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:43,990
they were not really willing to knock

844
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:46,750
over the other one and be completely

845
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:48,459
down for the two weeks it would take to

846
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:51,010
stand it back up because according to

847
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:52,150
their vendor had we done what we wanted

848
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:55,599
to do it would have caused a

849
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:57,339
catastrophic hard fail and they would

850
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:03,579
have to come and manually reset all of

851
00:41:57,339 --> 00:42:07,960
their equipment because I enjoy like

852
00:42:03,579 --> 00:42:11,410
having my paycheck and I also enjoy not

853
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:13,690
being in jail because that yeah yeah

854
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:17,078
they rescinded that letter update let

855
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:19,060
her out let me tell you but that's the

856
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:21,430
thing like these are the people who are

857
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:24,069
securing these networks oh and by the

858
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:25,390
way this is the best part um as we were

859
00:42:24,069 --> 00:42:29,859
leaving there was nobody on the front

860
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:36,400
desk as we drove in the morning there

861
00:42:29,859 --> 00:42:40,180
was nobody at the gate the cabinet was

862
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:42,960
helpfully labeled with like ot switch

863
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:45,129
and it wasn't locked

864
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,839
didn't anybody else see this a wonderful

865
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:49,119
situation that's going on in my head

866
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:50,710
where somebody drives up walks in plugs

867
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,510
into their equipment gives it an IP

868
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:56,950
address and takes down an entire

869
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:58,420
generating plant for a major state all

870
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:02,740
because they thought they were secure

871
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:04,480
that they didn't have a DHCP server it's

872
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:06,069
funny to us because we understand this

873
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,880
but for them they don't they think

874
00:43:06,069 --> 00:43:17,040
they're secure they're not this should

875
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:22,839
this year yeah me hey June timeframe

876
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:24,490
yeah so the second story tie um don't

877
00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:27,400
lie to your don't lie to your

878
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:29,979
consultants if you hire a pentesting

879
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:33,720
firm do not lie to the people coming to

880
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:36,069
do your pen testing it never ends well

881
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:41,640
especially if it's me because I know my

882
00:43:36,069 --> 00:43:45,550
luck a relatively recent we were

883
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:47,170
scanning a network and we're like okay

884
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:49,110
look you know last year we did this for

885
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:51,000
you and we asked

886
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:54,530
um if you have any particularly

887
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,970
sensitive equipment on your network

888
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:59,370
please let us know we'll be sure to

889
00:43:56,970 --> 00:44:04,399
handle it very gently and work just not

890
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:07,500
scan it all the equipment's been removed

891
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,640
you answer very quickly for someone who

892
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,700
just finished telling me they don't

893
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:13,620
really have any network documentation

894
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:18,180
yeah yeah no no I'm confident we ain't

895
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:23,700
all that last year are you sure yeah

896
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:27,210
it's entirely gone Jordan Network dude

897
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:29,069
you know it okay great so plug up do

898
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:32,070
everything we need to do wait two hours

899
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:35,700
for someone to assign a VLAN on the port

900
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:38,820
we're on and then we're like okay great

901
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:42,569
so let's start throttling down in math

902
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:46,050
to where it only sends no retries Wally

903
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:47,670
scans one box going through doesn't

904
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:50,190
parallel doesn't do anything like that

905
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:53,970
like I'm setting up to be watching and

906
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:56,100
that scroll across this network I am

907
00:44:53,970 --> 00:45:00,720
ready for this I have brought books I

908
00:44:56,100 --> 00:45:03,089
have other work to do yeah about 15

909
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:07,140
minutes and the scanning we're like hey

910
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:09,960
guys oh what are y'all doing we're

911
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:11,819
scanning I hope you do we're gonna do

912
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:15,110
yeah the operators are seeing some

913
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:15,110
really weird stuff can you stop it

914
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:21,030
define weird stuff yeah they're like

915
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,830
they're not getting really they're not

916
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:24,870
getting good telemetry like things are

917
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:26,759
messing up like alarms come on and then

918
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:28,500
they fade off and then yeah it's just

919
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:31,400
like a really weird stuff going on can

920
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:35,460
you can you can you stop scanning and

921
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:38,520
see if it clears up all right so he

922
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:41,760
stops getting clear okay move on so next

923
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:46,950
network a big deal except for a week and

924
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:50,070
a half later when the direct Grant High

925
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:52,439
pooh-bah of OD I don't remember the

926
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:54,090
dude's title now basically called us

927
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:59,609
onto the carpet for crashing one of

928
00:45:54,090 --> 00:46:02,020
their generators and we're like

929
00:45:59,609 --> 00:46:04,180
but he being one of your generators

930
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:05,950
crashed like we left that site there was

931
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:07,960
nothing wrong with the equipment like

932
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:09,189
everything worked like your operators

933
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:12,540
told us that it came back with no

934
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:15,250
problems no you crashed our generator

935
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:18,670
what does the word crash your generator

936
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:20,619
mean to you please explain to me well so

937
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:24,609
they have five generators four of them

938
00:46:20,619 --> 00:46:28,030
failed gracefully one of them did not

939
00:46:24,609 --> 00:46:30,490
and fried approximately four or five

940
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:33,099
different pieces on it that had to go

941
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:37,750
and be manually replaced out in the

942
00:46:33,099 --> 00:46:42,580
middle of nowhere and there's of course

943
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:46,900
our fault for some reason I don't know

944
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:50,230
why anyway so we're like ok well what

945
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:53,830
exactly happened well when you were

946
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:56,080
scanning the plcs on that network didn't

947
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:57,119
respond appropriately wait whoa whoa

948
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,529
stop

949
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:01,090
what do you mean the PLC is on that

950
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:08,920
network yeah we had PLC's on that

951
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:11,859
network so remember when we asked you if

952
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:19,000
you had any sensitive equipment on that

953
00:47:11,859 --> 00:47:23,890
network yeah were you lying well no we

954
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:25,750
just didn't know about it I'm sorry what

955
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:32,290
yeah we just didn't know about it we

956
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:38,349
forgot about it you you forgot about

957
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:41,740
major equipment that ensures the safety

958
00:47:38,349 --> 00:47:44,859
of the product that you produce for

959
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:47,740
major metropolitan areas you you just

960
00:47:44,859 --> 00:47:50,319
forgot that there's equipment on there

961
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:52,839
responsible for maintaining the health

962
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:54,460
and safety of that product well yeah

963
00:47:52,839 --> 00:47:57,940
we're we're still working on our

964
00:47:54,460 --> 00:48:00,369
documentation the documentation you gave

965
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:02,760
me is a decade old yeah we're still

966
00:48:00,369 --> 00:48:02,760
working on it

967
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:12,930
okay great and those are just two

968
00:48:09,299 --> 00:48:16,440
stories now you know why this is called

969
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:20,460
how to never sleep soundly again we're

970
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:22,260
in the major port down there right do

971
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:25,250
you imagine the type of nasty stuff that

972
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:28,079
comes through that port every single day

973
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:28,849
we have radiological monitors down there

974
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:32,869
don't we

975
00:48:28,849 --> 00:48:35,250
biological monitors chemical monitors

976
00:48:32,869 --> 00:48:35,819
how many chemical plants are around this

977
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:37,230
area

978
00:48:35,819 --> 00:48:39,150
how many waste treatment plants are

979
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:45,119
around this area that store ozone and

980
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:49,289
cotton toxic levels how many people buy

981
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:51,660
medicines generics you trust that those

982
00:48:49,289 --> 00:48:54,240
systems are maintained with health and

983
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:57,089
safety right that random like glass

984
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:58,348
shards don't get put in pills or that

985
00:48:57,089 --> 00:48:59,849
you're actually getting the chemicals

986
00:48:58,349 --> 00:49:04,349
and the right amounts that they say they

987
00:48:59,849 --> 00:49:05,970
are the people who are maintaining those

988
00:49:04,349 --> 00:49:07,950
networks think you can't get on the

989
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:10,250
network because they don't have a DHCP

990
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:10,250
server

991
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:22,779
so if you work at an environment like

992
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:24,610
this or you know people who do please

993
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:26,350
tell them that security is important and

994
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:30,670
that there are people out there there is

995
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:32,740
willing to help them with it if you are

996
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:34,540
participating any type of scanning or if

997
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:36,040
you see a telnet server on the internet

998
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:37,990
or if you're just running show down and

999
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:40,750
you see a PLC controller that's

1000
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:43,689
responding to telnet please report that

1001
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:46,120
and tell the company there who's running

1002
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:48,400
it who's responsible there's also

1003
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:50,350
specific pentesting suites available

1004
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:54,870
that concentrate on this type of thing

1005
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:57,250
summer is one of them in that has a few

1006
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:58,930
things they need help

1007
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:02,100
Metasploit auxilary scanners they're

1008
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:05,680
also getting pretty well in this areas

1009
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:08,170
and finally call my company we do this

1010
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:10,270
we're willing to help and I promise I

1011
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:17,010
won't tell the stories from that company

1012
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:20,910
up here again and the contact means sly

1013
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:20,910
so any questions

1014
00:50:22,829 --> 00:50:26,759
Wow really I scared everybody that bad

1015
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:38,339
okay awesome

1016
00:50:26,759 --> 00:50:40,199
yes it's regulation depending on the

1017
00:50:38,339 --> 00:50:46,910
industry there are certain there are

1018
00:50:40,199 --> 00:50:46,910
certain agencies and bodies of

1019
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:51,808
regulations I guess would be best way to

1020
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:54,539
describe it

1021
00:50:51,809 --> 00:50:56,609
they're responsible for maintaining that

1022
00:50:54,539 --> 00:50:58,769
Newark sip is a good one

1023
00:50:56,609 --> 00:51:04,679
there's another type of one for power

1024
00:50:58,769 --> 00:51:08,038
plants for chemicals usually FDA food

1025
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:11,130
usually falls under the USDA so

1026
00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:13,859
depending on the industry one

1027
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:17,819
specifically that should have regulation

1028
00:51:13,859 --> 00:51:21,199
that doesn't water treatment there is no

1029
00:51:17,819 --> 00:51:24,839
body of federal regulation that

1030
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:31,339
regulates water treatment plants they

1031
00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:35,869
are voluntarily doing their best right I

1032
00:51:31,339 --> 00:51:35,869
believe you had a question sir

1033
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:48,430
as far as trying to do finding systems

1034
00:51:45,759 --> 00:51:54,579
don't want your networks alright it

1035
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:57,190
sounds like just scanning um so the

1036
00:51:54,579 --> 00:52:00,069
first we do when we get on site is we

1037
00:51:57,190 --> 00:52:02,170
listen passively and packet captures to

1038
00:52:00,069 --> 00:52:04,720
see the type of traffic that flows by so

1039
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:05,859
if you see like Modbus or DEP 3 or

1040
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:10,299
something like that you watch the

1041
00:52:05,859 --> 00:52:13,089
traffic for 15-20 an hour a day to get a

1042
00:52:10,299 --> 00:52:14,920
general idea of the types of systems

1043
00:52:13,089 --> 00:52:16,720
that are on your network what their

1044
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,190
addresses are because some may not even

1045
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:21,160
have IP as it could all just be MAC

1046
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:24,930
address based and that way you can kind

1047
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:27,368
of map out what's on your network and

1048
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:29,109
then you can kind of start going from

1049
00:52:27,369 --> 00:52:31,329
there you'll have a baseline at that

1050
00:52:29,109 --> 00:52:34,960
point yeah it's this can be very tedious

1051
00:52:31,329 --> 00:52:36,670
stuff like it's yeah it's very sensitive

1052
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,499
it's very hands-off you have to like

1053
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:40,749
there's a reason why we use the fainting

1054
00:52:38,499 --> 00:52:42,578
goat Jeff because it's literally like if

1055
00:52:40,749 --> 00:52:45,578
you touch it wrong it falls over and

1056
00:52:42,579 --> 00:52:55,710
dies and then hopefully it comes back up

1057
00:52:45,579 --> 00:53:00,609
fast enough to where nobody notices I

1058
00:52:55,710 --> 00:53:02,140
mean we yeah I mean we we usually tune

1059
00:53:00,609 --> 00:53:02,799
it down to where it's only scans one box

1060
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:08,589
at a time

1061
00:53:02,799 --> 00:53:13,809
no retries doesn't delay like doesn't up

1062
00:53:08,589 --> 00:53:16,150
the delay on it and like max host group

1063
00:53:13,809 --> 00:53:18,579
of one very much

1064
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:20,200
a one box focus on that so if it kicks

1065
00:53:18,579 --> 00:53:21,849
over it doesn't bleed over into the rest

1066
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:24,999
of the network and you can isolate it so

1067
00:53:21,849 --> 00:53:28,059
that way the issue with SCADA stuff is

1068
00:53:24,999 --> 00:53:31,390
that if you do it right you can cause a

1069
00:53:28,059 --> 00:53:33,309
cascading failure because these networks

1070
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:35,230
will have dependencies and if one box

1071
00:53:33,309 --> 00:53:37,420
goes down and another box is depending

1072
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:39,220
on its data it may send up an alert to

1073
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:41,319
sing hey I'm not talking to this box and

1074
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:43,480
then if another one goes down it's like

1075
00:53:41,319 --> 00:53:45,460
oh there's two and then another one goes

1076
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:49,150
down three Oh catastrophic Network

1077
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:51,690
failure fail closed flush everything so

1078
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:54,880
it's very much a

1079
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:56,950
methodical checklist okay we're done

1080
00:53:54,880 --> 00:54:09,960
with this okay we're done with this type

1081
00:53:56,950 --> 00:54:17,470
of thing yes sir wait a minute itself

1082
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:18,790
there are some emulators out there you

1083
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:23,049
can find older equipment on eBay

1084
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:24,849
sometimes there are a lot of packet

1085
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:27,250
captures that you can look at as well to

1086
00:54:24,849 --> 00:54:29,740
see the traffic flowing through there's

1087
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:31,300
been a couple of presentations I need to

1088
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:34,209
look up the dates name I can't remember

1089
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:38,020
it offhand it's the guy who replayed a

1090
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:40,090
radio traffic for transmissions for dnp3

1091
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:41,849
he did a whole like I think either Def

1092
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:44,849
Con or black hat presentation on it

1093
00:54:41,849 --> 00:54:50,470
there's resources out there and samurai

1094
00:54:44,849 --> 00:54:52,240
is like the Metasploit of skate of

1095
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:53,980
hacking so it's got to like a lot of

1096
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:56,319
custom tools and hid and things in there

1097
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:59,290
and haven't really had much of a chance

1098
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:03,849
to play with it but I mean it's it's got

1099
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:07,980
a lot of different resources for you the

1100
00:55:03,849 --> 00:55:09,880
other questions fine once

1101
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:12,000
excellent well thank y'all I appreciate

1102
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,000
it
