1
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:38,040
to the front let's get friendly it could

2
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:40,650
don't take this so I do have cards with

3
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,449
backs in registers so after this is all

4
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,370
done just pick up a card and it's

5
00:00:42,449 --> 00:00:47,010
registered for services but essentially

6
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,910
I mean if you all are here today for

7
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,400
this presentation

8
00:00:47,910 --> 00:01:11,580
it's about strategic planning and resume

9
00:00:50,400 --> 00:01:14,009
writing that yeah cool military spouses

10
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,840
transition into their workforce how we

11
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,640
define what a living services that we

12
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,409
offer is present development we're very

13
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,909
good at not if you just basically have

14
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:22,860
someone that checks you know me only

15
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,030
every two communities because of you

16
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,609
they have the progressed anger to

17
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,640
recruit schools so for today I'm hoping

18
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:31,619
what I wanted to do well Orion is that

19
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,469
so we talked about networking as one of

20
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:37,380
three events cares are going to I want

21
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:38,969
you guys to quick picture this when you

22
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,658
start getting nervous or you're talking

23
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:45,678
to somebody goes this hello my game is

24
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:49,020
and this is what I am an expert in

25
00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:53,039
education I got this is how you do your

26
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:55,170
three second pitch to someone very quick

27
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:57,569
he surprised how quick as I can note

28
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,850
unless you have a toast education and

29
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:01,799
certifications you're talking to and

30
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,178
then you all the same in so I just

31
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,399
wanted to start off with this because

32
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:07,380
this event and other events that you

33
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,000
probably are checking out is that number

34
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,288
is very key and you want to be able to

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,560
introduce yourself so that you're

36
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:15,690
memorable okay so let's talk about what

37
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,760
we're going to be doing technically

38
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:21,120
these workshops are looking all dated

39
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,850
workshops but for today or who is here

40
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,700
there were anise laminates at 45 minutes

41
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:29,069
that little clock is gonna fly by what I

42
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,410
want you guys know is that we do have a

43
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:33,540
virtual workshop that will be scheduled

44
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:36,450
on October 15th which is coming up and

45
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,280
it's about nine eleven and it covers all

46
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,769
the material that you just solved from

47
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,420
the for mortals ever shared I'm keeping

48
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,400
you kind of this time bites of it so I'm

49
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,809
going to do a third group nobody won't

50
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,690
need to do to start planning your

51
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,850
strategic plan to transition into the

52
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:52,980
career I get into but also just do the

53
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,329
basics and resumes you're not going to

54
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,130
be an expert here and that's why I

55
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,620
really want you guys to register for our

56
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:01,680
services so then chelation specialist

57
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:04,170
can assist you on a jet that really fine

58
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,920
me like to read resumes started we can

59
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:11,130
start tailoring from the physician okay

60
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,320
so I'm a my name is Jamie Roppongi I am

61
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:16,200
very fortunate I work out remotely here

62
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:18,150
in Southern California but our

63
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,459
headquarters is in Georgia yes six

64
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:23,850
offices now multiplied by remote

65
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:26,580
multitude clients so I am here today

66
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:28,799
I've been working in better employment

67
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,550
for about seven years the career were

68
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,320
forced a little bit for ten years and

69
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:36,630
our appearances could be they're very

70
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,160
effective very efficient and the type of

71
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:41,160
services that you will get only

72
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,630
registered career coaching first order

73
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,970
would be resume writing so they're gonna

74
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:48,150
get your resume within four days of the

75
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:51,690
initial assessment ma Italy's mentor we

76
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:54,510
have a network of 700 plus mentors who

77
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,829
will turn their times actually the

78
00:03:54,510 --> 00:04:00,090
person in the back is what I'm working

79
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:07,640
hard volunteers than that job servicing

80
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:07,640
we help with employment opportunities

81
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:16,850
will somehow we were to prepare all

82
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:19,858
three for veterans and military spouses

83
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:24,590
so our services work so as you can see

84
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:24,590
we're here in the gear shift only you

85
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:37,409
can't be what you're doing you want

86
00:04:32,910 --> 00:05:23,489
he is like yourself

87
00:04:37,409 --> 00:05:28,318
so this is all Greek so let's talk about

88
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:30,659
the truth of the jargon you know we have

89
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:35,989
to think about this location or income

90
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:35,989
where the jobs are didn't they were just

91
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:47,069
animals you have to either build whether

92
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:49,949
or not like if your client so if you're

93
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:51,809
sending out the same resume so 500 like

94
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:53,610
employers never believe that that's

95
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:54,959
wholly not working because you're not

96
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,389
looking at the job description you're

97
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:59,849
not considering it your resolution a job

98
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:01,919
search now computer systems are making

99
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:03,929
it harder for people to get picked up in

100
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,479
terms of their EGS system with a

101
00:06:03,929 --> 00:06:10,498
tracking system so you have to find that

102
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:13,258
fine balance of networking of time for

103
00:06:10,499 --> 00:06:15,449
jobs an informational interview all this

104
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:17,579
stuff kind of ties in to how you get

105
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:20,099
pleases you gone we need to know you and

106
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:21,839
Angela break away that whole you know

107
00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:26,610
computer system so that we can hold you

108
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:29,189
out of that interview as well that's

109
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:30,809
good to my job so essentially what we

110
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:33,199
wanted to share the breakdown because I

111
00:06:30,809 --> 00:06:35,429
really it is not have your networking

112
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,219
80% but people can get employment

113
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:39,929
through their networks you can look for

114
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:41,939
an asteroid jockeys I will say if

115
00:06:39,929 --> 00:06:44,279
someone came up to me is like hi I'm in

116
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:47,419
need of a job I'm unemployed I would

117
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,419
probably like silence

118
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,590
well why does that matter you need it

119
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:54,680
you need a job you're not seeing me

120
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:56,719
equals not on the corner of prospective

121
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,250
employers you know fighting on to your

122
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,860
research that's really important but

123
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:03,710
also have to find out what that's really

124
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:05,870
happening at one company so good to talk

125
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:08,510
to you instead of really fight now or

126
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:10,280
the people that are hiring you and that

127
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:15,349
there isn't me to fill those positions

128
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:17,599
and if you're a right fit for that so

129
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:19,370
your neck okay so this is what the idea

130
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,260
is that you guys want to set yourself up

131
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:24,070
prepare make a plan

132
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:26,060
recognize your barriers and managers are

133
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:28,250
identifying what goals you might be

134
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,560
maybe that's educational maybe that's a

135
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:32,510
change of where you want to get a job

136
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,680
maybe it's not to be in San Francisco

137
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:36,140
maybe it's somewhere else it needs

138
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,330
Washington not to deliver your outlets

139
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:40,340
your personal needs in order to defy

140
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:42,740
your pant here deployment generalistic

141
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:45,349
let's become more experienced in the ice

142
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:48,410
road that means you're gonna have to

143
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:50,720
take in an entry-level job versus going

144
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:53,120
into the military so you got to think

145
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,800
about what was it like for you and

146
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,210
depending on this relationship that's

147
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,740
how you're gonna save real estate with

148
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:02,900
your with your with executor plan okay

149
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:05,030
so this is statistically what folks

150
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:08,719
think about veterans veterans and what

151
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:11,419
they're facing in the way there so do

152
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,360
you guys agree with this 60% of people

153
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:17,060
feel that slating their military skills

154
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,790
it's like a challenge for them getting a

155
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:22,430
stay back for yourselves you know okay

156
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:24,710
so that's what this is also perceptions

157
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:27,380
it's a global veterans our are taking a

158
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:28,520
survey I'm supporting percent feel that

159
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,430
before you start on your signal to your

160
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,679
culture that is true

161
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:35,450
28% filled employers on that blue so

162
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,979
that veterans don't have the addresses

163
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:39,140
as easy that's low

164
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,850
so that's our sure and then influence of

165
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,830
we hire veterans that social not sure

166
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:46,340
that's very little of our but he will

167
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:48,020
have that perception that is why make it

168
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,720
look like these are all the things that

169
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:52,610
might matter quiet floors wanna hire you

170
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,980
they see that the skills that you came

171
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,660
from all have these different soft and

172
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,070
hard skills

173
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,319
these are all very importantly and they

174
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:03,590
all clearly see that by this is exciting

175
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,180
targeting veterans or their companies it

176
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:09,980
really does bring along innovation a

177
00:09:05,180 --> 00:10:20,560
laborious and company so swapped if he

178
00:09:09,980 --> 00:10:20,560
did for yourself so so okay so you know

179
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:30,550
how are you

180
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,630
[Music]

181
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,200
[Music]

182
00:12:06,930 --> 00:13:04,540
so you're sending eight hours sending

183
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:06,670
resumes that means if you're not doing a

184
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,800
good job you could say that I applied to

185
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:10,689
multiple jobs but if you applied for the

186
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,540
job and never connected to the recruiter

187
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:15,010
that's a problem you have to review how

188
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,810
to connect your recruiter after you

189
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:20,030
apply for a job

190
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:21,800
okay so that was fast and I'm sure you

191
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:23,390
guys are far beyond that but you still

192
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,339
have to reiterate what the to teach it

193
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:26,660
looks like so we can get it down some

194
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:29,030
paper and what that looks like three

195
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:31,219
when you market themselves so how do

196
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:34,370
resumes reflects with their very types

197
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:37,670
of resumes chronological functional is

198
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:39,440
TV and then federal okay so I think

199
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,329
people are using chronological

200
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,150
functional in this room unless you're

201
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:46,460
going after government jobs and that

202
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:48,620
will be the federal resume do not use

203
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:52,130
the federal resume or a federal contract

204
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:53,990
on people get that confused often and he

205
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:56,360
will put paint get out of five to eight

206
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:58,700
page resume to federal contractors who

207
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,310
does not need that they need the college

208
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:03,020
and so chronological will wanted to pay

209
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:05,079
this for different industries

210
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:08,360
entertainment since one page but for

211
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,740
experts it takes you ages functional is

212
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,840
for someone who doesn't have a direct

213
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:14,480
experience so let's say that you're

214
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,830
starting snow well your your brand and

215
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,260
the reputation of being an IT

216
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:19,640
professional you want to highlight your

217
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,350
education you want to share all that

218
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:24,350
information and maybe that might not be

219
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:26,060
your past experience maybe you were

220
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:29,000
doing infantry but that doesn't really

221
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:30,469
share much about your idea you want to

222
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,680
highlight and move everything to the

223
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:35,240
front so this is how your resume will

224
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,280
look like the first thing that they're

225
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:40,070
gonna see you know I'll pop back is a

226
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,600
top third of your resume this is the

227
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:44,540
most important piece from someone's

228
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,700
standard argument take some second to

229
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:48,410
look at this if you don't have the

230
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,970
keywords like if you see at the top

231
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:52,010
everything is gold it's of course your

232
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:53,450
name is very important we see the tapas

233
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,819
is veteran advocate and workforce

234
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:57,650
management professional one fact see

235
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,510
that I'm gonna go into reading this the

236
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,470
summary and then I'm going to look at

237
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:03,080
your expertise because that

238
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:06,170
easy-to-refill bulleted this third of

239
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,640
the page is super important to more the

240
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:10,280
recruiter to continue in reading a

241
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:12,290
little bit so that part is super key and

242
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,699
as you can see this is how the resume

243
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:16,790
looks like so you have a professional

244
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:19,100
summary areas of expertise your

245
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:21,530
experiences education service and

246
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:24,320
technical competencies and then what's

247
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:26,540
the top third of the page you want to be

248
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,210
able to communicate if you do the job if

249
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:30,410
you're if you're capable of having the

250
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:32,990
background Experian

251
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:34,459
you can say that like I have ports and

252
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:38,180
plus years of experience during

253
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:40,939
logistics and telecommunication through

254
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:44,660
global experience in the military I'll

255
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:46,579
catch my eye and then you want to show

256
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:48,350
more impact so that the goal of the show

257
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:49,670
that you can do the job that they're

258
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:53,149
that you're a pop that they're that

259
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:55,779
you're applying for okay

260
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:58,699
make sure that this is clean and it's

261
00:15:55,779 --> 00:16:01,699
it's legible of course so you have to do

262
00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:03,769
like your group address you can just be

263
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:06,199
sitting state since now people are more

264
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:10,129
concerned about their identity so see

265
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:11,750
state that your your linkedin sometimes

266
00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:13,879
those links may not work so usually we

267
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,709
recommend saying LinkedIn and then

268
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:17,870
putting your name down then if you're

269
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:19,579
like me who has no other verb pollen in

270
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:22,699
the world I'm gonna be the only person

271
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:24,529
that pulls up but lovelies but you can

272
00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:25,969
put the LinkedIn URL but we kind of

273
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:30,319
recommend you just type your LinkedIn

274
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:32,990
profile and then the name in this part

275
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:35,209
so so this really highlights about four

276
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:37,730
to five strong statements about yourself

277
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:39,920
it can only be found if you write your

278
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:42,500
resume so you can spend two or three

279
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,599
hours trying to figure out who am i if

280
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,009
you write your work experience you will

281
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,500
find out all the great accomplishments

282
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:50,389
you've done so even though we're telling

283
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:54,019
talking about this first part we're

284
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:55,519
gonna get into this part this part is

285
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:57,110
where you don't start discovering all

286
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,470
those amazing accomplishments that

287
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:03,199
you've ever done you work through what

288
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:06,829
was it pregnant she passed and this is

289
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:08,780
how you write your job description so

290
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:11,270
name of the company location the

291
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:12,470
duration your job title just fine what

292
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:14,418
your role was like your the

293
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:16,850
responsibilities and then share

294
00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:19,370
accomplishment and then if you guys

295
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:24,559

00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:29,059
defining your role but then

299
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:31,130
accomplishment or separate so you want

300

302
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:38,719
role and then go instead accomplishments

303
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:40,970
and have three maybe eight I usually say

304
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,980
three to five accomplishments for each

305
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:46,220
job description

306
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:49,480
so rules for accomplishments please

307
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:51,950
don't reference yourself like a story

308
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:55,340
make sure everything's actions but also

309
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:57,380
past heads um use quantifiable

310
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:59,600
information so you can pull job

311
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:02,060
descriptions and see that jobs online

312
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,980
and you'll see like oh says all these

313
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,629
qualifications are looking for you want

314
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:08,120
to be able to say I do not in a

315
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:10,160
different and in your own words but also

316
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,800
say but I did it in the past and this is

317
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:17,120
the impact that I do you want to show

318
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:20,750
impact bullet point so this is how you

319
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,580
do it you want to show efficiency maybe

320
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,050
you've solved the problem maybe you see

321
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,120
the company money

322
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:27,919
so logistics is really easy because we

323
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:32,709
there's so many logistics resumes so you

324
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:35,930
can say I manage the property of like

325
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:39,650
weapons and equipment that valued 2

326
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:43,130
million dollars and with my like

327
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:44,870
operational efficiency I saved us 30

328
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:47,630
percent of the time that will take to do

329
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:49,219
the project that is a lot it means I'm

330
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:51,230
really good with process improvement I'm

331
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:53,600
really good about saving money and

332
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:56,150
protecting good so I would trust someone

333
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,610
who was like responsible for million

334
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:00,680
dollars of equipment so you want to be

335
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:02,360
able to ask those questions so what the

336
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,550
how and whether that you like what was

337
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:06,820
why was it so important that it be need

338
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:09,620
to know that I did strop responsibility

339
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:11,090
okay so let's do an example so

340
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,939
responsible for training for team

341
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:15,889
earnings the way that you could make it

342
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:18,410
better it's to really give a story of

343
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:20,600
what happened we trained those people

344
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:23,060
and then with the maintenance production

345
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,899
techniques you decrease it down fine by

346
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:26,690
30%

347
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:28,490
big difference okay so it could be just

348
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:30,980
okay he was responsible but what does

349
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:32,840
that mean and then because you describe

350
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,440
what you guys did and now I know you

351
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,820
didn't mean it

352
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,800
they're not going to expert in it

353
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,780
there's a lot of levels to learn that

354
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,669
translation that's what we want me to do

355
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:42,710
you can pull a responsible for training

356
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:46,180
for you Marines from a performer support

357
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:48,740
this is what they're looking for so

358
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:51,650
another one so expertly inspected

359
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:53,180
workspace that is very ambiguous and is

360
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:55,040
only three words and this is what we

361
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:56,630
would want you to get you Amanda

362
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,590
how long but we want you

363
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:02,600
bandit to that to that level so you

364
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:06,639
infected three departments which is

365
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:09,379
bigger identified 15 safety violations

366
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,870
develops correction plans and then

367
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:14,090
mitigated risk within five days Emily

368
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:15,500
way better right it's just subscribe to

369
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:17,449
everything that you did is like a whole

370
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:20,270
lot more work then maybe someone just

371
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:23,720
walking into room is like and then this

372
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:26,060
easy this is much better is deeper it's

373
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,490
like now I see that you had not do it

374
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:29,929
like I'm sure you did this over a period

375
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:31,880
but you might haven't seen that's

376
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:35,480
helping you do this because what three

377
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:37,070
Department okay so I'm gonna go back so

378
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,230
all this stuff that we just defined

379
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:41,570
about your accomplishments you're gonna

380
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:43,010
be able to pull those strong projects

381
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:44,450
that you really work on like maybe it

382
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:46,940
was a one-year project and you were so

383
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:49,220
proud of it you want to go back and

384
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:51,650
include this in your professional

385
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:54,170
summary picking out there was really

386
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,340
strong project and again relatable to

387
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,020
the job you're applying for

388
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:58,550
to get started you just want to pick

389
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,379
those best projects you feel like yeah I

390
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:01,700
did that guys I go to my favorite

391
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,660
projects that I've worked and then I'm

392
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,890
so proud of it

393
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,300
you don't have to talk about the things

394
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:06,770
we hated but you talk about all the

395
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,240
great stuff you loved and that's where

396
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:11,180
you put it at the top cuz you're gonna

397
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,220
be excited to talk about it you know so

398
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:15,620

402
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,820
five hours of staring at and like I

403
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:24,379
don't even like the word I used

404
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:26,000
I want to use a different word you need

405
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,440
to be nitpicky but really to getting

they're gonna read really quickly they

415
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,720
may not read it in the paragraph that

416
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:49,460
you wrote with their bitter feet that

417
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:53,270
really quickly with the nine expertise

418
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:56,840
in bullet points hey prevent fast

419
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:58,430
forward okay so now this piece so there

420
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,649
will be education under the professional

421
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:05,240
summer that we prepare there is a piece

422
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:07,490
of say career supported by education as

423
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,480
I have however you can go crazy and list

424
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:10,280
out everything that you've ever

425
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,310
accomplished within the ten

426
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:16,340
your experience on derp after I'm you're

427
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:17,570
working say so education any specialized

428
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:20,270
training that you did in the military

429
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:21,980
notable awards a lot of people don't

430
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:23,570
know what this means but we want you to

431
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,580
if it comes within conversation you

432
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:27,350
wanna say hey I did I got a commendation

433
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:28,580
that all like I got these really met

434
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:30,860
great metals because they're things I

435
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:32,179
worked it on technical skills so even

436
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,740
though this is at the bottom I actually

437
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:36,820
would say for you guys to move it up to

438
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:40,580
the top so I would recommend moving this

439
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:42,500
right beneath the areas of expertise

440
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:43,939
because they mirror each other they're

441
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,620
sure that you were able to do that in

442
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:47,570
their show that you accomplish out with

443
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:50,840
different certifications so I actually

444
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:53,679
recommend moving that to the top okay

445
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:57,560
what time are we are we doing it on time

446
00:22:53,680 --> 00:23:01,100
yes okay great okay so let's talk about

447
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:02,659
the technical skills okay so um this is

448
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:05,330
great for you all especially for those

449
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:07,490
who are doing like technical types of

450
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:09,470
roles coding and programming and

451
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:10,670
analysis work these are the things that

452
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:12,590
you want to be able to show that you're

453
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:16,300
capable of doing it your hardware your

454
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:18,980
soft skills your software analysis

455
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:22,159
architecture network all that stuff you

456
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:24,410
want to be able to to describe that on

457
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:26,010
their resume but how that as your areas

458
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:30,340
of expertise

459
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:35,560
okay yes

460
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:37,480
okay what do this okay so other sections

461
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,399
that you could do you can talk about

462
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,140
your languages or organizations so if

463
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,300
there's a company that really supports

464
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:45,580
the nonprofit or a volunteer like

465
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:47,470
voluntary organization or maybe it's an

466
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:49,419
association you should definitely write

467
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:51,430
that down that you're a part of and

468
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:52,900
affiliated to that association because

469
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,430
then that move that you are connected

470
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:59,020
and that you guys are in the same

471
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:59,320
community alright so I do this all the

472
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,139
time

473
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:04,270
I think I'm slightly dyslexic so I don't

474
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:06,130
I miss words when I'm writing have

475
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:07,840
someone else write and look at it for

476
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:09,430
you because it's just a nice little

477
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,429
screenshot cuz you can read something

478
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:16,240
and then end up missing like like lock

479
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:18,550
the words so typos are really big on

480
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,980
resumes why people pass on people so

481
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:22,330
simply is like doing a spellcheck will

482
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:24,250
get your resume passed

483
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:25,389
that's like smugness right so you just

484
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,520
want to make sure you give the most

485
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:29,140
final draft possible especially if it

486
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,180
the company you really care about you

487
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:33,220
want to be able to like get someone to

488
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,990
look at that piece if you like a like a

489
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,490
check for me for my sanity so I know

490
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:38,440
that I'm reading everything correctly

491
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:41,170
and then sending it off I know that

492
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,700
sounds tedious but like your friends you

493
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:43,870
guys will do it in your little support

494
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,940
groups and you guys will do it for each

495
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:47,679
other and and that's really what what

496
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:49,870
happens that you really meet your

497
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,190
mentors or your friends people who you

498
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:53,679
hear a lot I hope you will get

499
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:57,160
everything um I feel like I've never

500
00:24:53,680 --> 00:25:00,220
gotten a paper resume like forever I

501
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:02,440
think everything's online so don't even

502
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:04,660
try to go crazy with a portfolio of like

503
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,100
nice things like you just submit it

504
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,780
online a lot of people will throw that

505
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:10,480
away because it's just like a flyer than

506
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:11,680
going walks into the car don't include

507
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,850
photos unless you're in the

508
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,130
entertainment industry

509
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:17,050
some of them do you require photos but

510
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:18,760
really most likely they don't really

511
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:20,750
require their photo of you

512
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:23,510
well this is the part I wanted to get

513
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:25,100
this one it happens super often we have

514
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:26,600
to be Taylor loves me so I just fooled

515
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:28,699
you like this is how you bring a resume

516
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,949
but now I'm gonna figure out like how do

517
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:33,200
you make your resume speak to each job

518
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:35,480
because you have to basically say I can

519
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,910
do that job but you can't do that job if

520
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,799
your last job was not been safe and so

521
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:41,090
the idea is to show them I can do that

522
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:42,980
job because you see those skills what I

523
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:45,678
have so we want to show you where to

524
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:48,440
target those areas to tailor your resume

525
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,750
so reading the Job Description I will

526
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:54,049
save it now I'm going to write it job

527
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:56,210
scan Co will take the job description

528
00:25:54,049 --> 00:25:58,039
and your resume and it'll come up with

529
00:25:56,210 --> 00:26:00,770
the results to tell you how long your

530
00:25:58,039 --> 00:26:03,890
resume matches the job and it will tell

531
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:06,020
you key words that are not being used in

532
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:08,450
your resume but maybe use multiple times

533
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:10,100
on the job description and that's where

534
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:12,650
you want to go back to analyze your

535
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:14,240
resume like say I need to switch up my

536
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:17,539
words to use what the words are saying

537
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:20,330
in the job description analyze what

538
00:26:17,539 --> 00:26:22,309
employers are looking for extract

539
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:25,280
keywords from the job posting and then

540
00:26:22,309 --> 00:26:30,830
use those words and phrases in your own

541
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:32,658
application okay so I want you to defeat

542
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:34,820
the applicant tracking system or HR

543
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:36,799
people are hating this that's why Delano

544
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:38,480
does her recruitment differently because

545
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,730
she really hates food too it really

546
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:44,270
stops you and it gets what the companies

547
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:46,100
have to use these big systems and those

548
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:48,710
systems are fought I have yet to hear

549
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:51,350
the best applicant tracking system no

550
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:53,000
everyone hates it and that sucks because

551
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,649
that's the only way that you can apply

552
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,090
for these jobs and this system is

553
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:58,250
preventing you from getting through and

554
00:26:56,090 --> 00:27:00,110
all you really have to do is to make

555
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:02,390
sure that you're telling the resume to

556
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:04,100
what the job is is speaking to you and

557
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:06,289
that's how they're gonna pull that pull

558
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:08,149
your resume and Jonica speak more about

559
00:27:06,289 --> 00:27:10,640
it because i'm talking about in

560
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:12,650
generalities but she's seen it she's

561
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,909
seen it they like head on about like how

562
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:19,190
is like eliminating people from being a

563
00:27:16,909 --> 00:27:20,700
prospective candidate when clearly they

564
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:23,049
are perspective

565
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:25,029
so you really want to make sure that

566
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:27,070
there's nothing funky like it could be

567
00:27:25,029 --> 00:27:28,389
formatting issues maybe you put

568
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:30,490
something in the header or the footer

569
00:27:28,389 --> 00:27:32,379
and that could have been a reason why

570
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:34,570
the applicant tracking systems back your

571
00:27:32,379 --> 00:27:36,070
resume out because we don't like it you

572
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:37,928
really want to make sure all those words

573
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:40,090
are there and it's very simple so that

574
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:44,499
it could really perform the assessment

575
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:49,209
that you're a right match okay so fancy

576
00:27:44,499 --> 00:27:51,279
fonts logos graphics like really get get

577
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:52,860
rid of the fly the technically these are

578
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,639
good about not having fluff

579
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:56,258
entertainments a little different but

580
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:58,508
for guys intact I think you good you

581
00:27:56,259 --> 00:27:59,830
want like black or white or black and

582
00:27:58,509 --> 00:28:03,070
white like you really want something

583
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:06,369
simple and it speaks to the point okay

584
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:07,720
so when you do your tailoring these are

585
00:28:06,369 --> 00:28:09,730
the areas that you guys are going to be

586
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:12,070
focused on tailoring it's a third page

587
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:13,720
right but for top of the third page it's

588
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:16,149
going to matter to you matter to the

589
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,309
people who are looking at a resume it's

590
00:28:16,149 --> 00:28:20,799
gonna be looking at that that under

591
00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:22,928
underneath the line it's like what your

592
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:25,918
defined job title is or what your

593
00:28:22,929 --> 00:28:28,659
expertise are and then it goes into your

594
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,039
nine bullets of expertise it was are

595
00:28:28,659 --> 00:28:31,929
gonna be really important that you see

596
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:33,429
or make sure that's different for every

597
00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:34,990
job that you're applying for and then it

598
00:28:33,429 --> 00:28:38,200
matches what you tailor job description

599
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:41,350
so tip for the job can I would youth job

600
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:43,119
scan so you find out what words are

601
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:45,219
being used and they'll say nine times

602
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:47,970
that operations have been used

603
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:50,619
throughout the resume that better be a

604
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:53,259
bullet it was known as the operations

605
00:28:50,619 --> 00:28:54,549
like and we've twice or three times in

606
00:28:53,259 --> 00:28:56,139
the beginning and then throughout the

607
00:28:54,549 --> 00:28:58,990
resume I have to make sure I give you

608
00:28:56,139 --> 00:29:00,908
the operations operations operations um

609
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:04,600
so that's their ways of targeting what

610
00:29:00,909 --> 00:29:06,309
those phrases are is to use the job scan

611
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,408
unless you're brilliant at looking

612
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:10,418
matching words but I can't see that I'm

613
00:29:08,409 --> 00:29:11,799
not over like with an overview of a job

614
00:29:10,419 --> 00:29:14,919
description I want to be able to see

615
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:16,149
that but that helps you see OHS like

616
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,529
different things that you might be

617
00:29:16,149 --> 00:29:20,139
missing when you're applying for jobs

618
00:29:17,529 --> 00:29:22,330
you can read and say I I you know I'm

619
00:29:20,139 --> 00:29:23,918
qualified but your resume is not gonna

620
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:26,100
say unless you use the language that

621
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,100
there

622
00:29:26,179 --> 00:29:31,350
okay so here's an example training

623
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:33,570
specialist job description we're looking

624
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:35,939
for a training specialist to enhance the

625
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:38,760
conference's ease so first thing I'm

626
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:42,750
gonna write up a training manager very

627
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:45,658
obvious change ok responsibilities

628
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:47,909
delivering training courses delivering

629
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:50,399
training courses identifying trainings

630
00:29:47,909 --> 00:29:52,850
like literally took the key phrasing

631
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:55,408
that mattered in that job description

632
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:57,779
building annual training program so like

633
00:29:55,409 --> 00:29:59,820
literally are inserting that information

634
00:29:57,779 --> 00:30:02,070
into your little cookie cutter template

635
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:04,320
then you put together everybody it's

636
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:06,418
really simple right maybe at least do

637
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,939
this you're getting closer to getting

638
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:13,230
selected or to be picked up from this

639
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:16,139
computer system so requirements in

640
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:18,029
instructional design Theory I'm gonna

641
00:30:16,139 --> 00:30:21,240
put instructional design on my first

642
00:30:18,029 --> 00:30:23,909
bullet full training cycles training

643
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:31,350
cycle so you get set start singing like

644
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:33,570
the difference is now yeah okay okay so

645
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:35,699
we don't want you so I think people are

646
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:37,439
used to like I need to share everything

647
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,960
because they think everyone needs to

648
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,750
know everything about the jobs that are

649
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,669
not relevant well I would do sometimes I

650
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:47,610
would say applicable like employment

651
00:30:44,669 --> 00:30:49,470
history and then other work experiences

652
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:51,209
just if I really wanted to show that

653
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:53,460
gonna have gaps in employment like I

654
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:55,049
would do that however like for something

655
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:57,090
that you guys are applying for you know

656
00:30:55,049 --> 00:30:58,710
I like the jobs that matter to the

657
00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:01,080
employment that you're you know employer

658
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:05,019
that are applying for

659

00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:32,379
four needs to turn back or regulate for

671

you so you don't have to ask you for

672

specialist but I can give you guys a

675
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:41,590
flight deck

676
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:54,240
if you guys want my my business card or

677
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:54,240
they've questions yeah

678
00:31:54,690 --> 00:32:00,390
do something you get it done you don't

679
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:03,660
know how much you increase efficiency so

680
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:04,890
how are you how would you turn hands

681
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:07,400
like that for civilians they'll

682
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:07,400
understand

683
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:13,680
so I I feel like you can give an

684
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,300
estimation but like let's let's be by

685
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,920
dates and let's say that project this

686
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,750
one to take me like she needs to do or

687
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,340
three weeks to do if it took you less

688
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:22,530
than that time then I would use that as

689
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:24,689
your indicator with challenging though

690
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:26,399
is that your memory now I can't remember

691
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:28,830
a lot of stuff that I just did and I did

692
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,180
wall on so that's like the hard part is

693
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:32,669
like tracking all these great things

694
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:35,520
that you've done but I mean if you can

695
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:38,220
explain how you did it and that know

696
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:41,250
that you created an impact by reducing

697
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:43,170
the time or maybe it's the value that is

698
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:45,390
of the equipment that you manage and

699
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:46,950
there was zero issues you can put down

700
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:49,920
that there you know there were zero

701
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:52,920
issues with with with the with the

702
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,750
results of my work and you're able to

703
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:57,600
move forward and be able to get other

704
00:32:54,750 --> 00:33:00,270
things done so as long as the you can

705
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,429
get out from approximation okay I think

706
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:04,830
you could say like yeah that took me

707
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:06,810
like me I probably reduced it by 20% of

708
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:09,000
the original time like here just kind of

709
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:10,740
activating it but I would say if you

710
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,350
have a pretty decent memory

711
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:15,350
it's like I remember cutting up people

712
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,230
Oh

713
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:16,480
smaller companies you know

714
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,720
well I mean other cities are losing to

715
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:34,250
people he talked to their Peter Berg if

716
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,770
you can do that before in your life

717
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:38,180
I would highly recommend that would be

718
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:41,980
ideal

719
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,980
