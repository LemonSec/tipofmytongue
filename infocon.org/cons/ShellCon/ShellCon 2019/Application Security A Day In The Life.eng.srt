1
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,890
yeah so the whole purpose of this talk

2
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:38,320
is application security and we wanted to

3
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:39,970
kind of go in the day-to-day which I

4
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,890
don't think a lot of talks kind of dig

5
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:45,129
into especially about like a specific

6
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,750
job or due to your role so we really

7
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:48,309
kind of wanted to drill in on what it is

8
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,710
actually like to be an application

9
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:53,290
security or app sack is what we call it

10
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:56,170
so yeah that's what sort of spawned this

11
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:57,369
whole thing a little bit about myself we

12
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:59,530
can all read I'm not really going to go

13
00:00:57,369 --> 00:01:03,729
over that verbatim but essentially I

14
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:06,460
consider myself a failed developer and

15
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:08,020
once I started to see my own websites

16
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,369
get hacked I'm like okay like clearly

17
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,950
I'm not really out like this I need to

18
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:13,390
figure this out and I was very

19
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,470
fascinated about how certain things are

20
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,960
happening how certain attacks were

21
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:19,060
happening so that sort of spawned me on

22
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,500
this whole different path from kind of

23
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,630
one side of the glass to the other which

24
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:25,719
was away from development more into like

25
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:28,990
how hardening apps or just even

26
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:31,030
penetration testing as a whole so it was

27
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,979
a very interesting transition it wasn't

28
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:35,710
nothing that I actually set out to do it

29
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:37,539
was just kind of it's just the way this

30
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:38,919
everything of all of what I was in at

31
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:41,170
the time and the things that were

32
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,499
happening at the time and my career as a

33
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:45,939
quote/unquote web developer yeah so

34
00:01:44,499 --> 00:01:47,640
that's just pretty much myself I believe

35
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:50,610
we'll have these slides available so

36
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,560
there'll be more content agree

37
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,999
[Applause]

38
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,999
[Music]

39
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:06,099
[Music]

40
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:40,208
does anyone know what it happens think

41
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:41,380
on your phone yeah yeah everything is

42
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:46,000
kind of everything is an app

43
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:47,980
unfortunately yeah so yeah web athlete

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,750
is a computer program that essentially

45
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,640
utilizes a web browser so that's kind of

46
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,870
more the realm that we're talking about

47
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,799
we're talking about applications or our

48
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:58,769
apps or more web web based so with that

49
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,570
what is apps a core application security

50
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:04,030
oops so it's basically the use of

51
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:06,970
software hardware and some procedural

52
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,910
methods to protect the application from

53
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:13,989
external and internal this is important

54
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:15,459
threats and so some of these are the

55
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:17,560
components that are in application

56
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:19,390
security so we just talked about some of

57
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,280
the methods or like what application

58
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,109
security is so there's software

59
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,440
software's evolved within software we

60
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:27,459
have like buzzers scanners firewalls on

61
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,739
the hardware side of things we have

62
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:32,380
physical security hardware security

63
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:34,090
modules firewalls as well both software

64
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,700
and hardware and then the procedural

65
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:39,269
methods which are think more of be like

66
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,940
the carbon side of things the processes

67
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:43,570
the scans the actual training

68
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,640
implementation of things of that nature

69
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,530
within the actual organization in

70
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,480
application security so think of it as

71
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,640
there's people and then there's tools

72
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:55,649
and kind of both of those are required

73
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,649
for like for the security side of things

74
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,070
[Music]

75
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,750
[Music]

76
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,769
[Music]

77
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:24,599
and then where the applications hosted

78
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,500
so we talked about what types now

79
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,040
talking about like where do they

80
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:31,200
actually sit so tradition would be like

81
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,169
on prim most companies that the older

82
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,000
school thighs we have a our office we

83
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:38,760
have a physical server and that's where

84
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,770
whatever it is we're doing sits and then

85
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,390
as we progress along things become like

86
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:44,580
remote is now sort of like a car very

87
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,870
common thing it's not even a standard

88
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,090
now depending on like where you're at

89
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:50,640
but so with that remote now we have like

90
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:52,109
a datacenter and then we also have like

91
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,680
the cloud which those two kind of go

92
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,570
hand in hand

93
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,970
and then kind of to piggyback on a lot

94
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:58,349
of this is where they hosted our on the

95
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:01,380
internal and external it kind of goes

96
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:02,640
like on the types of applications where

97
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,320
as an internal application is an

98
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,030
application that you yourself your

99
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,370
company only has access to internally

100
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,510
the no one from the outside can gain

101
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,000
access to the application without

102
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:13,169
certain rules and then the external face

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,260
I'm going to be more like the public

104
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:17,700
facing your your like a website so to

105
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,380
say something that anyone from the

106
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,860
internet could just easily get to you by

107
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:24,520
typing in the URL

108
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:26,290
so that so where they're hosted also has

109
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,599
a lot to do with the the actual like

110
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:30,550
application security and in how certain

111
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,720
degrees or levels of application

112
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:35,410
security will play out they're gonna

113
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:37,480
where they actually sit is it more of a

114
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,860
issue if it's public facing where

115
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,840
everybody can access this or is it more

116
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,700
issue initiative it's just internal and

117
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,739
all the employees employees can access

118
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,960
that so where they're hosted plays I

119
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:56,290
feel like a big role in the overall

120
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:59,320
security posture scan all the things and

121
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:01,570
so with scanning part of the different

122
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,950
processes manual and automated at some

123
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,210
of these things may be familiar we'll

124
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:06,099
just kind of do like a high overview of

125
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,570
all of these so on the manual side

126
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,550
there's the actual code review which is

127
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:11,110
there's code in front of you and you can

128
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:14,770
literally read the code and review it

129
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:16,180
and then go through sort of some testing

130
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:18,580
at that point where you can maybe catch

131
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,990
some things right away and then the

132
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,940
flipside of that automation would be

133
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:24,880
like the actual SAS which is a knowledge

134
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:26,469
is an automated algorithm just reading

135
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,300
the code instead of the human and then

136
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:30,670
finding things that maybe they may pose

137
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,530
a threat or vulnerability and then on

138
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:34,270
the manual side we have the penetration

139
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,619
test which would be typically still

140
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,450
manual in this day and age there are

141
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,800
some automation and tools for that but

142
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:41,650
the most part it's still it's still a

143
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,390
manual process and then we get all into

144
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:45,010
all the automated stuff which is the SAS

145
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:47,740
which is the static like we talked about

146
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:50,170
at the code level very common is the the

147
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,760
- the dynamic that's more of the

148
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:54,780
application is up and running and you're

149
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,620
you're essentially

150
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,729
scanning or figure out the bones that

151
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,560
are in that and that's typically

152
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:01,360
probably one of the more popular ones

153
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,570
because that typically represents the

154
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,820
like use most use case in the wild most

155
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:09,340
attackers hackers are gonna be targeting

156
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:11,320
some form of a running application as

157
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:13,929
opposed to like getting to the code and

158
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,370
modifying that and and learning that we

159
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,690
have the either the interactive

160
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,880
application which is very similar to

161
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:20,740
vast and then we have the rest which is

162
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,810
kind of on the left side the firewall

163
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,460
side which is a runtime application so

164
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:27,400
that's actually something that's running

165
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:29,260
at the application level and at the

166
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:33,490
process level so when a process comes in

167
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:34,630
to to run the agent if you will sees

168
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,970
that or the engine

169
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:38,650
seize that process and goes this is like

170
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:40,810
you shouldn't allow this process or will

171
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:42,909
allow this process think of like a SQL

172
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:44,049
injection it sees that process where

173
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:46,150
that process it would normally have to

174
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:47,770
like allow that run it could easily see

175
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,540
that and say like oh we shouldn't let

176
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:51,520
this run so we're not so that's that's

177
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:53,500
basically their rap side of things where

178
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,090
it's on the actual box running and it's

179
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,280
sort of checking everything that comes

180
00:08:55,090 --> 00:09:08,430
in almost like an anti-virus so to say

181
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:10,390
so those are the different types yeah so

182
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:19,300
actually rapid7

183
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:20,980
provides our ask I'm not sure for open

184
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:24,550
source for wrasse but open source does

185
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:26,320
do you have other identity and plenty of

186
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,760
SAS tools and SAS is usually done like

187
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,740
at the the code level like we talked

188
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,090
about like and per code so there's like

189
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:34,900
a SAS for PHP there's like a SAS for

190
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,250
java or something like that

191
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,140
you usually have like little modules

192
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,280
that you would run where DAST is

193
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,630
definitely more again we're talking

194
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,640
about like more of the runtime it's

195
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,960
running that does have to take in

196
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,449
consideration some of the frameworks and

197
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:48,960
languages but at the core it's really

198
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:50,890
just doing like a Volm test essentially

199
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,660
so I'm not too sure about some of the

200
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:55,480
open sources but the majority of the

201
00:09:52,660 --> 00:10:00,480
players in App SEC offer one or if not

202
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:03,160
all of these applications and services

203
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,750
correct like a traditional laugh is like

204
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,850
an older school technology where think

205
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:09,220
of it as an actual firewall in front of

206
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:11,260
the application where a rasp is actually

207
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,360
running on the application so now we're

208
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:15,520
talking about like the process level of

209
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,310
allowing or not allowing an action to

210
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,050
take place versus just a set of like

211
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:21,310
maybe arguments that the Lapp would hit

212
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:23,050
where it's like it doesn't meet this

213
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:24,699
criteria allow it or not allow and

214
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:27,069
what's like a firewall rule it was like

215
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:29,770
a laugh and the rasp is more literally

216
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:31,780
at the process level of this code came

217
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:33,670
in to execute does it meet these

218
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:35,470
criteria good so you know like an

219
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,890
algorithm sort of say and it allows it

220
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,890
it doesn't allow

221
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,380
so yeah but think of it if it's a web

222
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:02,869
app this is more particular to like a

223
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:05,480
web instant web application environment

224
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:07,220
as opposed to any other asset or any

225
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,860
other like runtime environment so that

226
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,970
we're talking specifically like

227
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:13,670
applications running web applications

228
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,930
running and then the rasp itself usually

229
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,819
involves some sort of what we call like

230
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:18,649
an agent where it's installed on the box

231
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,420
and again it's running on the box and

232
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:22,190
then it's sort of reporting so every

233
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,300
either every server or whatever

234
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:25,190
application you have you would install

235
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:27,290
these agents they would all kind of call

236
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:28,190
home you would log into home and that

237
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:30,290
would give you like a readout of

238
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:36,230
everything that's happening for all your

239
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:39,740
applications so to me they're very

240
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:41,390
similar and there's not a lot as far as

241
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,740
from how I differentiate I think more

242
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:45,949
it's like an either a marketing thing or

243
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:47,660
at least at the overall level I think

244
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:50,930
the highest level of the - versus the

245
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:58,610
ist is really it's it's scanning the

246
00:11:50,930 --> 00:12:01,489
environment that's running so I think I

247
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:04,220
think I I considered a sin ist the close

248
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:06,260
brothers like siblings where the

249
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,940
assassin the rasp I feel like are very

250
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,950
different from those two and they're

251
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:14,270
very different from each other

252
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:16,660
yeah and so now that we have owner

253
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:18,589
abilities so we're doing some scanning

254
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,579
where what do we do with the

255
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:23,800
vulnerabilities who should they be

256
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:23,800
passed to as far as like actual owners

257
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:11,790
yeah I think risk risk level is probably

258
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,080
the most common that most businesses

259
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:15,360
make their decisions on whether or not

260
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,160
what the SLA for the patching is going

261
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,620
to be how quickly they can get to it and

262
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,329
then and then yeah it mark it down or

263
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:28,340
whatever is far or more conformability

264
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:28,340
of right there has to be priority set

265
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:37,620
exactly so a high an internal high could

266
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:39,870
could be from an external purpose like

267
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,460
no like doesn't exist from it from the

268
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:46,160
outside so yeah lots of things are take

269
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:46,160
into consideration in the risk

270
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,130
yeah and you'll also find there's a lot

271
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,350
of metrics also around like how long is

272
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:05,430
it the vulnerability bit out

273
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,990
because usually the longer something has

274
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:08,939
been out the more its been weaponized so

275
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:12,090
the greater the risk of a possible

276
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:13,020
attack or you know a because because

277
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:15,360
it's been around for so long which is

278
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:18,150
why we still see to this day like SQL

279
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,440
and XSS are still so common but they're

280
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:23,780
like they're like ancient you know

281
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,780
findings so so yeah the risk

282
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,580
[Music]

283
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:44,520
[Music]

284
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:20,490
[Music]

285
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,949
[Music]

286
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:38,559
[Music]

287
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:48,750
and they were good question so there's a

288
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,920
few reasons and some of them there's a

289
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,960
lot more than what's listed here but I

290
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,910
feel like these four are probably the

291
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,040
more common reasons of why a company

292
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:58,020
might go to the vendor and this is sort

293
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,610
of all going to the whole purpose of the

294
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:03,060
talk is the vendor side client side like

295
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:05,520
a day-in-the-life so we'll get there so

296
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,870
a vendor provides a few things one of

297
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,430
the reasons is maybe lack of actual

298
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,570
knowledge maybe there's a company they

299
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:11,640
have no idea what even application

300
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:13,620
security is how to implement it any of

301
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,380
that so hey let's just pay this other

302
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:17,879
company to do that lack of experience

303
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,470
maybe they do have a team and they're a

304
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,270
small team or even large team but that

305
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:22,800
team is an experience they just they

306
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:25,770
just want to start rolling this thing

307
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,820
out and they don't want to they would

308
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,750
they still want to have the coverage

309
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,700
they don't want to wait for these guys

310
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,320
to ramp up and then have awesome

311
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,420
coverage so basically it's pay this team

312
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,340
to do this that's third party while we

313
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:37,110
ramp up our own internal processes so we

314
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,790
can make this transition transition of

315
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:41,639
letting them go and then the company

316
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:45,810
continues lack of resources same thing

317
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:47,340
scanning people scanner and people so

318
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:49,020
the resources again it's funding the

319
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:51,030
tools and the resources and the people

320
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:52,320
to do said thing and then again there's

321
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,750
the cost sometimes it might be called a

322
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,490
cheaper to hire third party to do your

323
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:59,370
security than it is to do your own

324
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:00,630
internal security so those are there's

325
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:02,129
other reasons but these are the main I

326
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:04,560
think for that kind of play into the

327
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:07,620
role of why you might handle go out

328
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:09,570
forward third party what are some of the

329
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,219
roles and responsibilities so we're

330
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:14,330
gonna go over kind of the roles and we

331
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,330
kind of need to speed through these

332
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:41,389
then the vendor side kind of going

333
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,820
through the process of interaction

334
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:45,710
there'd be a sales team maybe some kind

335
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,770
of non technical liaison that's assigned

336
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:50,300
to you like that / to that account a

337
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:53,660
consultant maybe does the deployment of

338
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:56,720
said you know job advisors like myself

339
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:58,520
we're sort of assigned to that uh that

340
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,950
account and we are the technical adviser

341
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,780
security adviser for everything that

342
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:05,120
we're doing before that for the entity

343
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:08,450
skin operations they're more of the back

344
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,399
side of the third party on the technical

345
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,410
side and then support obviously if the

346
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,880
company that's hiring us to do something

347
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:15,020
that they have an issue they need to be

348
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,590
able to reach out to support they have

349
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:23,470
something fixed or addressed and so now

350
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:23,470
we'll break out into the actually like

351
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:28,489
[Music]

352
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:55,639
[Music]

353
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:32,540
so operations absolutely then your and

354
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:37,430
support the meeting developers and sr22

355
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:40,659
requirement and then and they doing the

356
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:40,660
actual work that we thought

357
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:50,209
like me yes without compunction so I

358
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:54,080
worked with to address on the public

359
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:58,520
option it up you go through so I give

360
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:00,110
you an actual happy in the data and I

361
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,690
have to sit down go either under 10

362
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:06,469
points that we can talk other 20 knots

363
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:10,910
up to figure out what that you can

364
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:22,549
identify off and then I often meet with

365
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:24,110
grand management and supervisors and so

366
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:27,799
with that is basically where I would

367
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:29,389
step in as a vendor so sitrep the first

368
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:32,000
thing I do with every morning wake up

369
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:33,830
check emails basically has anything

370
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,049
happened during the night that I need to

371
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:38,059
address immediately basically any fires

372
00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:41,780
may be put out did that our scans knock

373
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:42,980
something over destroy something did we

374
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,750
fill up databases which is random

375
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:47,059
garbage which we all we do we do a lot

376
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:49,010
of basically again anything that

377
00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:50,660
happened it requires me to hop on a

378
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:52,790
phone call immediately with said say

379
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:55,549
panda to say hey what's going on did

380
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:57,260
something break and then on the scanning

381
00:22:55,549 --> 00:22:59,840
side of things so we've done it whatever

382
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:01,070
damaged that's you know situation that

383
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,959
may have occurred or may not have

384
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:04,250
occurred so now I start checking like

385
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,530
hey what are some other scans and I'm

386
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:08,720
responsible for have those kicked off

387
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:10,970
did any of them fail are they still

388
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,559
trying to run and then once all that's

389
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:14,000
done we get back to valhalla nation

390
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,440
basically you want through all the

391
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,840
findings and then check and see if the

392
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,910
exploits are actually a valid exploit

393
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,459
for that company within their actual

394
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:24,710
environment again my goal is by the time

395
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:26,090
that I deliver the report to panda that

396
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:27,919
the only findings that they need to

397
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:30,139
worry about are they all validated

398
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,299
findings so we might do a scan and find

399
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:34,549
500 but we've actually whittled that

400
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:37,549
down to maybe like a few like a handful

401
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:39,710
of actual findings that are actual can

402
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:41,150
be exploitable in their environment and

403
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,950
so those are the ones that we would

404
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:44,720
prefer them to act on and to worry about

405
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:48,290
patching and the other ones are just

406
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:52,100
basically non-existent and then going

407
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:53,659
back to how we like judge or I I have a

408
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,740
very good reputation with

409
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,450
with Panther at her company so I know

410
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:58,340
that maybe certain findings we need to

411
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:00,020
upgrade or downgrade because of their

412
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,850
environment or because of their specific

413
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:04,700
requests because maybe their internal

414
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:06,649
compliance says any and all xs/s

415
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:09,050
regardless we're gonna treat that as a

416
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:11,360
high or a medium and it may be an actual

417
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:13,220
low maybe XSS didn't actually work but

418
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,899
it caused the stacktrace so maybe that's

419
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,820
part of recon they weren't actually able

420
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,100
to like store reflect something but it

421
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:20,750
broke the app some way but they're still

422
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,939
they still want that to be a high as

423
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:25,130
opposed to we might consider that actual

424
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:27,260
low because no access actually happened

425
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:29,060
but the app acted in a way that it

426
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,860
wasn't supposed to so that still may be

427
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:33,230
a finding that maybe something could

428
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:36,679
could occur from just having that

429
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:39,440
knowledge and then going back to the

430
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:41,840
management side the reports and

431
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,280
scheduling time so at some point I would

432
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,740
want to sit down with hand and her team

433
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,990
to go over those findings of hey this is

434
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:49,370
what we found here's how we maybe think

435
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:51,590
you should try remediating maybe they're

436
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:52,790
looking to us for consulting maybe their

437
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,530
team is just fine and they just want

438
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:56,210
those with the numbers of the metrics

439
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:59,030
and the reports but it's still a good

440
00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:00,920
relationship to have for both birth

441
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:03,560
teams because even though we are a

442
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,460
vendor we kind of we still tend to want

443
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,139
to think of ourselves it's just an

444
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:08,180
extension of the company that we're

445
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:10,400
helping and not just like some random

446
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,720
you know stranger third party so we want

447
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,980
to be very very integrated in what it is

448
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,290
they're doing so we can help them in

449
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:18,770
their security posture we move along in

450
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:20,629
that space so with all of that now you

451
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:22,670
kind of have a very quick rough idea of

452
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:26,030
app second what it is that what we

453
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:28,100
actually do in the space some ideas of

454
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:33,879
some things maybe to get into to help

455
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:33,879
you out that journey start yeah

456
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:46,480
absolutely yeah and we see that a lot

457
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:49,090
with either fuzzy nor SQL injections

458
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,770
where we maybe didn't dump data or find

459
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:53,230
out anything specific but we got a

460
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:55,510
result back that should be addressed by

461
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:58,900
the application owner I see that a lot

462
00:25:55,510 --> 00:26:00,550
with SQL and XSS or fuzzing where maybe

463
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:02,590
we're trying to actually pull data out

464
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:04,000
but instead we crash the application but

465
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:05,590
sometimes in a crash you get a stack

466
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,200
trace and that that could be very useful

467
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:09,850
information because maybe now I know the

468
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,920
platform what type of database you're

469
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:13,928
using and other info maybe even paths

470
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:16,210
and things like that so so that should

471
00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:17,410
be error handling is I think a big part

472
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:19,720
that's overlooked in a lot of

473
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:21,429
applications and there's a lot of recon

474
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:28,720
that you can do just by crashing an

475
00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:30,610
application so absolutely because maybe

476
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,040
that's my goal was to bring it down I

477
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:35,040
mean you know so there's definitely

478
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,760
something to say for for those types of

479
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,920
vulnerabilities even if it's not what

480
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:41,890
was intended that was more of a like a

481
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:44,679
byproduct so these are some ideas of

482
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:46,330
kind of what maybe again if you're

483
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:48,160
looking to get into obligation security

484
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:50,530
obviously you don't know sailing you'd

485
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:55,059
be like a master at these but knowing

486
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:56,950
these will go a long way and some of the

487
00:26:55,059 --> 00:26:58,780
common tools there's a lot of them out

488
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:01,570
there but these are probably the more

489
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:03,280
common tools that you'll run into a lot

490
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:05,678
of these I literally use daily I'm sure

491
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,600
has panda does as well so there's a

492
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,920
handful that that you'll use daily

493
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,340
there's maybe another handful that

494
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:13,600
you'll every once a while go to

495
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,889
application security is kind of a small

496
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,928
space that's I don't want to say it's

497
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:18,130
really an afterthought but there's a lot

498
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:19,660
of other things that companies are

499
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:21,850
usually more focused on with their

500
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:24,610
security like deployments of internal

501
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:27,010
network you know intrusion and asset

502
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:28,780
scanning and things like that it's just

503
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:30,670
as important but again it's usually

504
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:33,309
considered like a smaller Department

505
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:35,410
smaller kings and so with that there's

506
00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:37,330
usually not a ton of tools I mean if

507
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:38,640
you're in this industry there's a good

508
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:40,809
chance you've heard of the tool or

509
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,340
whatever it is that someone is bringing

510
00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:44,590
to the table or it does the same thing

511
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:46,030
something else does so it's it's kind of

512
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:47,530
good that it's kind of a small community

513
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:50,460
like that but it's just as important of

514
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:50,460
all of them and

515
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,119
[Music]

516
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:09,669
[Music]

517
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:20,920
[Music]

518
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:53,670
right so usually when we come in we're

519
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:55,710
very aware of what we're scanning

520
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:58,050
there's no time where a company's going

521
00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:00,420
to hires and say scan our apps but we

522
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:02,669
don't know the app so it's gonna be like

523
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:03,870
here's a list of our apps in scan so it

524
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:06,300
is different perspectives different

525
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:08,489
goals I think different jobs but as an

526
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,840
it is nice that I think higher of

527
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:11,340
third party vendor sometimes regardless

528
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,699
of the space because they can come in

529
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:16,740
objectively and see where where you ad

530
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:19,320
where you where you should you be in

531
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:21,210
this may in your security posture but

532
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,220
also it gives it's kind of like watching

533
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:24,450
people play checkers or chess when

534
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,130
you're watching you can see all these

535
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:27,179
moves but when you're in it you're may

536
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:29,040
be distracted there's a lot of other

537
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:30,570
things going on so there's a lot of

538
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,490
times where we'll stumble across things

539
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:34,500
outside of just always scan your app

540
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:35,610
it's also like oh we scan your app and

541
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,410
then found this and then there's like

542
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:39,240
you pull that thread and it leads to a

543
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:41,130
lot of other things that wasn't may be

544
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,440
intentional in the beginning but because

545
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:45,750
we're the outsider we kind of have that

546
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,580
like high overview scope of well where

547
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:48,840
could this actually lead us even though

548
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,490
you're just honest Oh scan this game was

549
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,980
vulnerability we're doing this and then

550
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:55,800
going oh and by the way like there's

551
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:57,750
yeah yeah we're you know so it's it's

552
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,250
yeah there's a lot of I think a lot of

553
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,660
reasons why both bullard it's not a

554
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:02,790
right or wrong or better or worse it's

555
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:04,380
just I think having the ability to maybe

556
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:06,210
hire a third-party vendor sometimes

557
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:07,730
works really well and that's very common

558
00:31:06,210 --> 00:32:07,260
we have a lot of team or a lot of

559
00:31:07,730 --> 00:32:09,179
companies that it can also be used as

560
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:11,309
you have two teams which happens quite

561
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:13,140
often as well where it's almost a way of

562
00:32:11,309 --> 00:32:14,370
doing validation if team a and B found

563
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,380
the same thing there's a good chance

564
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:17,729
that that's a legitimate find and again

565
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,530
so now the company doesn't really have

566
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:20,970
to worry about going through the

567
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:22,410
measures of do we need to retest this to

568
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:24,630
actually validate it looks

569
00:32:22,410 --> 00:33:09,510
validating two separate entities found

570
00:32:24,630 --> 00:33:11,610
the same thing almost like an audit yeah

571
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:14,100
it is it's very common that's also part

572
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:16,500
of our job as as we hate to find those

573
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,939
things we love to find those things and

574
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:21,170
there have been instances and you also

575
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:24,330
have to think of we as the vendor are

576
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:27,210
specialists in this field where is the

577
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:28,679
company may not have have specialists or

578
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:30,960
it could it could also be the sense that

579
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:32,910
maybe company has high turnover or maybe

580
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,980
teams have moved in common gone and

581
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:37,500
things get lost and procedures get lost

582
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:39,090
so there's a constant that you can kind

583
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,310
of bring in to that environment because

584
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:42,780
even the best the best company is still

585
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:44,399
gonna have turnover of some sort people

586
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:46,500
are gonna come and go or move even

587
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,480
within the company so again if you have

588
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,520
this constant that comes in that says

589
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,890
hey this is what we do is what we do you

590
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,420
know for everyone and so this is kind of

591
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:56,580
again and we tend to look at things

592
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:57,720
differently where's internal teams look

593
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:00,600
at things I feel like it with a little

594
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:02,820
bit some blinders and the outside team I

595
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,889
think it's as a broader scope sort of to

596
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:07,139
look at things and know where things can

597
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:09,480
go with some of the findings and that

598
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:11,340
and it happens quite often where I had a

599
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,889
finding that had been there for maybe 10

600
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:14,940
years that we did we found and there's a

601
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:17,310
good chance that we weren't the first

602
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:18,990
people to find that obviously so but

603
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:21,000
again it goes and this particular

604
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:23,189
company has a high turnover so it

605
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,750
there's and at the end of the day like

606
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:26,639
they need to figure out well why did

607
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:28,739
that exist but again it's something that

608
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:32,250
we found that they clearly have not

609
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:35,870
found ever so there's definitely I think

610
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:35,870
benefits to having an outside team

611
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:41,370
yeah

612
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:56,440
[Music]

613
00:36:31,099 --> 00:36:37,799
yeah I think a lot of that to expedite a

614
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:39,569
path would be learn basically figure out

615
00:36:37,799 --> 00:36:41,849
all the tools of the space like anything

616
00:36:39,569 --> 00:36:43,500
and then learn some of the tools like

617
00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:45,450
like any gig it all really comes down to

618
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,069
like the tool and then there's

619
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:48,480
day-to-day things no matter what you

620
00:36:47,069 --> 00:36:49,920
know there's gonna be like this is the

621
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,680
set things I'm gonna be doing every day

622
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,210
so the tools for sure and then I think

623
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,680
outside of that knowing how the tools

624
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:56,819
work and to be able to do some manual

625
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,558
things because most tools are always

626
00:36:56,819 --> 00:37:00,480
automating everything to be able to go

627
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:01,890
back and then manually like replicate

628
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,030
what the tools are doing and I think

629
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:05,098
just having an understanding when I

630
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:06,839
think it's a fast-track any career would

631
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:08,970
be sty had say start at the tool level

632
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:10,890
because there's so many paths even

633
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:12,569
within application security but I think

634
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:14,190
that it kind of all starts at the tool

635
00:37:12,569 --> 00:37:15,720
and then knowing that really well and

636
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,980
then just knowing that is there's a

637
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,899
probably a good chance that if you were

638
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:20,790
to go apply somewhere especially if you

639
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:23,010
know what what company a tool what they

640
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:25,829
use if you already have that that's it's

641
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:28,230
a really good experience whereas when

642
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:30,240
you now come in now last time for you to

643
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:31,980
have to ramp up internally and every

644
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,299
company is like how how fast can I get

645
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:35,339
this employee like up and running and

646
00:37:33,299 --> 00:37:37,619
like actually like putting out stuff

647
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:39,359
output for the company so if you already

648
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:40,680
are familiar with the tools they look at

649
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,480
that as like okay this this would be a

650
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,460
fast ramp up we can't actually get him

651
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,880
doing work for us like very quickly as

652
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,440
opposed

653
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,270
- he's never heard of or seen the tool

654
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,400
before and now we have to figure out how

655
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:52,170
this person we gotta train them on the

656
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:56,090
tool and then move on so I think

657
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:56,090
learning the tool is very very important

658
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:03,840
yeah yeah I think well we'll get all

659
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:06,810
these slides out - I think it'll be

660
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:08,790
access no it's good in the soft the soft

661
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:10,560
skills is like it's legit thing and I

662
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:12,120
mean you have to realize that you don't

663
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,520
necessarily know who your audience will

664
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:16,650
be in Adana this is gonna vary it will

665
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,840
be devs it will be c-suite it will be

666
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:20,220
PM's it will be everybody so you really

667
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:22,890
need to be able to talk at all those

668
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:24,359
levels kind of competently so tools is

669
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:25,950
important soft skills is extremely

670
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,060
important again because you have to know

671
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:29,609
your audience your audience is always

672
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:31,500
gonna change especially like at a vendor

673
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:33,240
level but even internally you're gonna

674
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,740
have certain audiences along the path

675
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:38,100
and so you really need to be able to

676
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:39,810
talk at every level just to get your

677
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:41,580
point across or I like you know to let

678
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:43,799
someone know about a bone or you know to

679
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:45,240
talk to a developer and and because

680
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,830
developers I feel like are very

681
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,359
sensitive in their work because they

682
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:50,790
feel like you're calling their baby ugly

683
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:53,010
so they don't want to hear that you've

684
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:55,020
broke it or found something terrible so

685
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:57,450
you got to begin soft skills delivery of

686
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:59,910
how can you sort of massage that

687
00:38:57,450 --> 00:39:02,069
conversation you're gonna get things

688
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:03,390
done and at the end of the day it's all

689
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:05,040
the same team but a lot of times it

690
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:06,210
doesn't feel like that but and that's

691
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,009
you need to address that that you're all

692
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:11,450
on the same team the goal is for the

693
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:11,450
better of the company yeah

694
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:18,269
