1
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:29,390
awesome hello everyone my name is Aspen

2
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:31,848
Loulou is so nice because it's so nice

3
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,800
my pop today is on how a diverse

4
00:00:31,849 --> 00:00:37,400
workforce provides a competitive edge

5
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,839
that's just no fancy jargon for having a

6
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,440
diverse workforce it's actually

7
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:43,879
profitable so a bit about me i am i

8
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,159
worked at crowd check as a threat

9
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:50,540
analyst i'm currently the vice president

10
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:53,809
of women in cybersecurity and i love

11
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:56,390
bold appoints i'm my technical person

12
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:58,459
I'm not really creative or graphic cool

13
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:04,180
so I will use bullet points frequently

14
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:06,080
in Austin if I can so when I started out

15
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,580
diversity is really important to me and

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,310
so when I wanted to do this talk I

17
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:12,229
wanted to look at like the the profits

18
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,310
the money the bottom line because you

19
00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:15,890
know you could talk about how great

20
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:18,680
diversity is but your businesses will

21
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:20,930
buy into it unless you show them the

22
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,560
money as Carnegie says all the one is

23
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:28,549
the money so I love cardi B also I

24
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,259
should have put that in here too so that

25
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:32,899
is what I focused on today so when I was

26
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:34,909
looking up looking up diversity and

27
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:37,130
profits I came across this quote about

28
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:38,840
having diversified investments and it

29
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:41,089
makes sense you know the bias for

30
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,170
investing is have a diverse portfolio of

31
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:46,969
stocks of bonds and mutual funds even

32
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,619
you know that way you're protected

33
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:51,589
against you know any downturn in the

34
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:53,359
market but of course I made the mistake

35
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,189
of ignoring said advice because I was

36
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:57,199
all about you know going to the moon

37
00:01:55,189 --> 00:02:01,969
these penny stocks you know Lambo dreams

38
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:04,639
instead of cried money and lost it all

39
00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:06,529
and then I wasn't profitable until I

40
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:08,780
made a diversified portfolio so

41
00:02:06,529 --> 00:02:11,450
companies like this might have a same

42
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:13,250
thought process of university that's

43
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:15,350
just a social thing that there's no real

44
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,510
profits to be gained in it but actually

45
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:20,000
there's a lot of money when it comes to

46
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:22,670
diversity and I'll explain that right

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,880
now actually let's go right into the

48
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:27,260
negative bond one impacts on not having

49
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,880
a diverse workforce and these are kind

50
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,590
of dense but I'll go over them so

51
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,690
companies in the bottom quartile for

52
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:35,420
both gender and fourth Nyssa tea and

53
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:38,090
race are less likely to be profitable

54
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:40,130
under equal performance of companies in

55
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:42,230
the same industry and the same countries

56
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:44,690
implies a diversity is a competitive

57
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:46,940
differentiator shipping the market share

58
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:49,160
towards immerse more diverse companies

59
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:51,650
higher turnover costs that's just you

60
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:54,709
know a given and increase lawsuits on

61
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:57,440
sex race age and religious

62
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:59,209
discrimination so that was pretty

63
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,700
interesting and I wanted to go down that

64
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:03,800
road a little bit so then I looked up

65
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,750
and to like the like the past year of

66
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,340
headlines you hear about you know Riot

67
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:10,190
Games who I love with the legends of

68
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:12,980
Riot Games come on you know an uber how

69
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:15,019
they had workplace harassment before and

70
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,700
after the IPO and their IPO actually is

71
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:18,260
they're they're three percent under

72
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:21,079
their stock price right now but if it's

73
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:24,829
under the IPO we work oh my gosh there's

74
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,390
a lot there's a lot to unpack there but

75
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:28,459
I mean that they had you know issues

76
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:31,220
with discrimination really toxic work

77
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:33,440
more culture and a lot of other things

78
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:37,940
that need a plate apart with their IPO

79
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:40,220
even being delayed and then if you go to

80
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,290
the EEO C's website which stands for the

81
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,359
Equal Opportunity I'm sorry Equal

82
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:46,340
Employment Opportunity Commission you'll

83
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,260
see reports like this of them finding

84
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:52,280
companies for you know religious

85
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:54,410
discrimination disabilities race age and

86
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,750
the fines go from like twenty thousand

87
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:58,579
to half a million dollars that they're

88
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:01,040
just dishing out so can you imagine your

89
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:02,510
company you know working so hard on its

90
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,820
image on its brand

91
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:07,370
unperfect ation getting likes getting

92
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:09,620
just smack in the face with the repair

93
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:12,860
with bad headlines in the press bad

94
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:14,570
publicity bad posts on Glassdoor getting

95
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,579
fine like could your company survive

96
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:19,279
from that could they turn around from

97
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:21,168
that I mean if I company said I worked

98
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,580
at another Crunch drank I would say the

99
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:24,289
answer is no that would bankrupt them

100
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,330
that's a huge mistake

101
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:30,310
of them ignoring diversity in the

102
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:32,539
workforce and so there's some positive

103
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:34,820
bottom-line impacts on diversity of

104
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:37,039
course that is diversity initiatives are

105
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:39,640
proven to have more direct impact on

106
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:41,960
business revenues you also have

107
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:44,390
diversity initiatives help organizations

108
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,430
and attracting high caliber talent with

109
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:49,070
diverse skills and perspectives your

110
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:51,080
customer base are also more diverse now

111
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:52,820
so if your company has a diverse

112
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,990
workforce that can identify with its

113
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:58,730
customers they'll understand their needs

114
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:00,530
consumer buying power of diverse groups

115
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,900
is significantly increasing and will

116
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:04,729
continue to do so having a variety of

117
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,150
perspectives increase your company's

118
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:09,890
creativity and enriches which is making

119
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,810
additionally the variety of insights

120
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:14,719
expressed helps leaders make informed

121
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:16,670
and responsible decisions then you have

122
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,940
you know companies that are the top

123
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:20,870
quartile for race and and ethnicity are

124
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,850
35% more likely to have financial

125
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:26,390
returns above the respective national

126
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:29,150
industry medians you also have companies

127
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:31,880
who are you know more diverse genderly a

128
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:33,679
gender not a word gender by diversity

129
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,480
are 15 percent more likely to have

130
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,840
financial returns above the respective

131
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:41,720
industry national medians and your

132
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:45,020
threat actors are also diverse the

133
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,910
Capital One breach by woman I'm not I

134
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:50,539
mean I'm not like bragging about that

135
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:52,910
but like it's not it's not like ethical

136
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:55,220
but you know you have female hackers you

137
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:58,180
you have you know nation-state actors

138
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:01,070
targeting like groups in Brazil you have

139
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:03,350
you know Russia is a big one too so like

140
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:05,420
you can't just have a team that looks

141
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:07,070
and thinks and acts the same way you

142
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,590
need to be diverse in order to combat

143
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:14,990
just you know be profitable and combat

144
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:17,929
your actors so interesting enough having

145
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:19,670
diverse leadership teams also and I'm so

146
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:24,110
sorry Chris I know your sunglasses are

147
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:26,240
on because bright you know the diverse

148
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,460
leadership teams will will actually help

149
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,230
bring in nineteen percent more revenue

150
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,210
than other companies and so this is

151
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:35,210
important I think it's because diverse

152
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:37,820
leadership teams will also will be more

153
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:40,370
open to having a diversity and inclusion

154
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,620
program you know that not only that but

155
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:44,630
they're going to be able to have

156
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,700
employees that can think that relates to

157
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:49,490
them that understand them that feel

158
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:53,270
comfortable talking to them and working

159
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:54,650
for them so I'm actually pitching for

160
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:56,900
everyone to have a diversity and

161
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:58,580
inclusion program and so this is how

162
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,919
this is really pretty graphic you can

163
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,990
see on how how to start that you know

164
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:05,780
that it has to start from the top

165
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:08,540
have to have executive buy-in your CEO

166
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:10,369
your exec team they have to believe that

167
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:12,920
to commit and that commitment will then

168
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:14,540
can skate down it's so a diversity and

169
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,330
inclusion program is a top-down

170
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:19,070
bottom-up engagement like bottom line if

171
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:22,330
you don't have that that it's not going

172
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:25,159
to succeed it's going to fail and so

173
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:26,510
going over how to watch a diversity

174
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,400
inclusion program it's actually pretty

175
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:30,650
complex because you need to make sure

176
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,299
that you tailor it to to grow your

177
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,799
business and to not and to not alienate

178
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,540
any groups that you currently already

179
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,550
had in your company it's very delicate

180
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,410
balance and going over that actually

181
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,720
would be much more longer than 20

182
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:43,760
minutes you know the talk so here are

183
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,190
some resources that I found online that

184
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,420
you can go and look into to help pitch

185
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:53,900
your company to have a diversity

186
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:55,910
inclusion program yes yes of course

187
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,890
because I wanted this to be more like a

188
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:01,480
pitch excels pitch for a why diversity

189
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:04,669
matters anymore of a profitable way and

190
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,500
then we have here so don't wait my word

191
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:08,000
for it you know we have you know summer

192
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,740
security companies that have publicly

193
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,210
went on record to say that they have

194
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,570
diversity and inclusion programs in

195
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:14,900
public

196
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:16,880
auto semantics force point carbon black

197
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,989
and crab strike and I put them all on

198
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,150
here even though these are our

199
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:22,520
competitors because that because I am

200
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:24,260
unbiased I do like that they went out as

201
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,180
a competitor to say that this is

202
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:30,409
important you crunch the numbers this

203
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:33,140
this is impactful and so I was actually

204
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:34,700
you know looking up top companies for

205
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,199
diversity so diversity Inc they have

206
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,610
their own list and needed B they

207
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,400
actually have theirs for like you know

208
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:42,830
top companies for women to work for you

209
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,840
can find all kinds of reports like this

210
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,700
these are companies that want to market

211
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,530
themselves as you know diverse because

212
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,510
they want to have that talent pool that

213
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:53,780
diverse talent pool and let me tell you

214
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:56,120
I met some women and men who worked at

215
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:58,579
Cisco and they think about how happy it

216
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,830
is to work there that their management

217
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:03,560
is good and if anything happens you know

218
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:07,040
with CrowdStrike he I might go to Cisco

219
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:08,719
know with that Microsoft Microsoft they

220
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,579
I I've been I've been a tech for 10

221
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,560
years believe it or not and I saw I've

222
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:15,470
been across I've been that I was there

223
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,810
for Vista you know so you know

224
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:19,910
and and teams before it came out like

225
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:21,229
teams but their original teams and I

226
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:23,360
told them to their face it was garbage

227
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:25,250
but their new version of teams is really

228
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,540
good myself their products are coming

229
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,520
out it's really great

230
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,870
like the innovation that they have like

231
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,579
they're pumping money into their

232
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:33,530
research and development teams as well

233
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,910
as their employees and it's obvious

234
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:37,400
because the products that they're making

235
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:38,930
is good and Microsoft and Cisco they're

236
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,730
not on this list but they come up often

237
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:50,479
on like top companies to work for it

238
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:52,880
because they're so diverse yes Mary you

239
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,710
know that's a great question I don't

240
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,780
know the answer to that but I have a

241
00:09:54,710 --> 00:10:02,930
source to this and they can go to that

242
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:23,630
website and see yeah so maybe blue is

243
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:25,459
not good I I don't know and I'm so sorry

244
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:26,870
I should have the answer you know I

245
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:29,030
didn't actually notice the color

246
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:34,370
difference until until you pointed it

247
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:36,829
out my eyes are bad so then we have so

248
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:38,660
if you can't complete like immediately

249
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:40,310
launch University and inclusion program

250
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,180
you can at least start individually you

251
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:43,099
know and that starts off with

252
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,959
recruitment you need to be able to teach

253
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,790
your recruiters to check their bias and

254
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,950
Harvard actually has a couple of

255
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:50,719
websites then you can go to to test they

256
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:52,220
have various bias test actually is more

257
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,260
than one bias test well and then that

258
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:56,300
can go to to take these tests you want

259
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:58,189
to recruit from diverse talent pool now

260
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,599
what what does that mean exactly so as a

261
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:02,000
company you go out there and you

262
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,200
advertise to your customers right the

263
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,640
cousins that you want to buy your

264
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,740
product you need to go out there and

265
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,750
advertise the people that you want to

266
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,900
apply for your company you can't just be

267
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:14,030
like website Here I am

268
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:15,650
come come apply it's like Carol Here I

269
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,610
am come up my product it's not going to

270
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:19,670
work you got to go out there and

271
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:21,560
advertise you want to hire to expand the

272
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,750
team's perspective not reinforced it's

273
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,670
already there you want to move beyond

274
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:27,530
culture fit and look for culture ad

275
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:29,329
because culture fit can actually be

276
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:30,949
exclusionary

277
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:33,310
you should offer internships you know

278
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:35,870
because it's a no-brainer you can then

279
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:39,349
recruit top talent right out of college

280
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:42,110
and not just know the universities but

281
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:44,029
also the community colleges my husband

282
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:46,310
went to a community college right and

283
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:48,260
now look at him he is a manager at a

284
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:50,119
software billing company you know so

285
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,860
don't discredit people from from my

286
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,029
associate I'm sorry Community College

287
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:55,220
because they're pretty good too

288
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:58,910
there's talisay that's right there is

289
00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:01,100
talent at community colleges and then

290
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:03,350
attend conferences like shell con you

291
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:07,690
know go out there and say hey I'm hiring

292
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:10,880
I support you I want a recruit from you

293
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:13,579
okay so after you work so hard to

294
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,040
recruit your employees you want to keep

295
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:17,870
your employees so a big thing that you

296
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,329
can do is offer leadership program

297
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:22,279
I'm not trying to brag but CrowdStrike

298
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:23,209
did that this year and I was a part of

299
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:25,880
it and it was a really great experience

300
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:28,279
and I needed enough time I had a mentor

301
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,200
who she helped me overcome my impostor

302
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:32,600
syndrome you know and it was good I

303
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,820
needed that at that time and don't just

304
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:38,540
look for an actual program program it

305
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:40,399
can be informal mentorship stew so so if

306
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,740
you see your employees just naturally

307
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,810
building in more informal internships

308
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:47,779
please please just encourage that to

309
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:48,920
grow i'm nurtured that even you want to

310
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:50,450
build and i'm sorry

311
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,099
professional development programs is

312
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:54,110
also really good and you don't have to

313
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,459
actually like you know make a program

314
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,200
you can actually sponsor them to go to

315
00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:59,829
conferences like shell con and attend

316
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,540
their workshops and def con at layer 1

317
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:04,640
these are the things you can do you want

318
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:07,219
to also build an inclusive culture where

319
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:09,680
every voice is heard equally and n is

320
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:13,070
respected I can't tell you how often I

321
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,959
want to speak but I think well I be you

322
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:16,579
know what I'm taking like not seriously

323
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,439
you know and that's and that just from

324
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:21,770
experience being the only woman

325
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,480
sometimes in a room full of men who have

326
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:26,779
different views or may have how may

327
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:30,440
thinks a certain way about me so I might

328
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:32,089
not often speak up because of that you

329
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,120
should also offer flexible work

330
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:36,890
arrangements that's just a thing for now

331
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,630
like not another thing it's a it's a

332
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:40,490
really good thing to have at your

333
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:42,500
company because if you can offer remote

334
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:43,160
options like my boys back there from

335
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,290
Crouch so I

336
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,339
isn't it off isn't it awesome people to

337
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:48,319
work from home I come to the office

338
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:50,780
whatever you want it's really flexible

339
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,000
and it's good for families like me to

340
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:54,380
who have kids who go to soccer for some

341
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,770
reason at five o'clock on a Friday night

342
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:59,689
so so I have to like be flexible and

343
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:01,790
they're flexible with me so that is a

344
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:02,870
great way of keeping your your talent

345
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,969
because now even though I'm thinking

346
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:07,250
Cisco Microsoft they're good but

347
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:09,110
crashing so I can work from home I can

348
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,490
make my own hours that's keeping me

349
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,960
there that's keeping me here at

350
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:13,910
CrowdStrike

351
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,140
you want to also use exit interviews to

352
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:17,660
accurately identify the cause of

353
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:20,150
turnover and I suggest using a third

354
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:22,160
party because your soon-to-be ex

355
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,449
employee he's not going to tell you the

356
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,400
the straight truth of why they're

357
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:28,040
leaving so a third party company will be

358
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,150
able to capture that data and because

359
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,530
they don't want to burn that bridge with

360
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:35,600
you they want to use you again as a

361
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:37,370
reference and finally in Bob's become an

362
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:42,620
ally you know women in cybersecurity

363
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:49,310
SoCal there's also ws always get back

364
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:51,050
and wrong WSC or intimacy yes okay okay

365
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:53,660
see I get them mixed up all the time

366
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:56,000
there's def colored lesbians who tech is

367
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:59,000
I like them they're great empowering

368
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,160
bunch group of people you have a suite

369
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,710
and when you attack any to be and you

370
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,900
should speak up if you ever see one of

371
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:07,370
your colleagues men male or female

372
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,199
that's that's key diem event that you

373
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,910
think they're getting harsh treatment go

374
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,710
to that person and educate them you know

375
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,910
and also good that person compliment

376
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:16,190
them tell them that that they're great

377
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,900
empower them get them over that imposter

378
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,880
syndrome because I'm gonna have it you

379
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:22,610
know being the only Brown person or

380
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,380
black person or female in a team they're

381
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,670
gonna have that that sense of imposter

382
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,380
syndrome so if you empowered them

383
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:29,000
they'll come out and do great things and

384
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:31,280
they'll be your friend like these guys

385
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:40,480
right there these two guys they're my

386
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:43,189
allies with them guys are awesome so

387
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,440
diversity in cybersecurity it is crucial

388
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:48,200
to success it is profitable

389
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,570
it offers variety it attracts highly

390
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:53,089
qualified talent pool and enhances

391
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:54,890
innovation it promotes equality promotes

392
00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:57,020
a positive culture reflects your

393
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:59,030
customers reflects the threat actors

394
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:02,569
and it definitely requires a top-down

395
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:03,949
bottom-up engagement so that is that is

396
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:08,180
it and I want to just say one more thing

397
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:09,500
a quote from prison adding me I believe

398
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:21,319
we can be extraordinary together rather

399
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:24,230
than ordinary parts all right

400
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:52,370
so sorry any questions I think we uh I

401
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:54,650
talked back yes yeah why do go to

402
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,850
university so strike one against me so I

403
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:58,069
don't have the answer for that but I

404
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:01,790
suggest you can collaborate with other

405
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:04,190
organizations like WSC like Lisa's

406
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:07,190
because we definitely will want to work

407
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:10,220
with you guys to help either bring

408
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:12,530
events to your campus or help you in

409
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:14,810
terms of strategic options that you can

410
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:20,209
do to attract more people I'm a more

411
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:22,129
diverse crowd of people to your club yes

412
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:23,839
yes these two ladies right here these

413
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:28,660
two yeah look at what them they will

414
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,659
help you out we we need to work together

415
00:17:43,399 --> 00:18:03,120
yes how do you how do you shift that to

416
00:18:01,649 --> 00:18:06,178
ask to have men asked women

417
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,580
I don't know ask these two guys I put

418
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:11,130
him on the spot all the time there I

419
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:13,199
know I don't know what because I know

420
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:15,389
what you I have been there but for some

421
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,220
reason I have people met company men and

422
00:18:15,389 --> 00:18:19,559
women coming to me asking me questions

423
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:22,440
and I'm really honored I don't know I

424
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:23,760
guess they feel comfortable coming to me

425
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,440
I don't know how to answer that question

426
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,149
maybe but maybe they could give you

427
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,450
their perspective putting your spot

428
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:29,449
sorry

429
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:45,309
that's a really good really good answer

430
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,559
yeah see this is what happens when you

431
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:50,230
have a diverse audience that can all

432
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:53,190
collaborate together on an issue this is

433
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,190
why I love the receipt

434
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:32,680
I know you had a question too I have to

435
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:34,270
retouch with Lori's I told her that I

436
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,250
was gonna do this on purpose to put all

437
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:37,840
these links to these slides and then I

438
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,710
wanted to send it to her so she can give

439
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,330
it out to you guys

440
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:43,450
I don't know how to get to you directly

441
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:45,040
individually but Lori should be the one

442
00:20:43,450 --> 00:21:01,990
I'm gonna go through to disseminate this

443
00:20:45,040 --> 00:21:03,850
information yeah yeah no no definitely

444
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:35,910
not I I definitely do

445
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:35,909
yeah yes well I sir yeah there are yeah

446
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:43,780
I mean if you can talk to them in person

447
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,370
I'll be better than you know the

448
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,930
internet fighting you know because you

449
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,689
get a lot of internet keyboard warriors

450
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:51,460
and it works for the call but if you can

451
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,900
just have a sit-down with them and talk

452
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,030
to them like actually communicate with

453
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:56,470
them and give them my good examples as

454
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:57,940
like what their actions were doing and

455
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:59,680
how it hurt them and how it hurts the

456
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,490
business and how it hurts their position

457
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,860
too

458
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:04,390
and then yeah I don't know I've never

459
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,729
been on that side I've always been on

460
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:09,610
the the receiving end of said Dirk

461
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:10,960
behavior and I've tried to I don't

462
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:11,919
respond very well but you know two

463
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,560
wrongs don't make a right

464
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:16,710
so in that situation so if you as a as a

465
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:20,530
third party can come in and just like

466
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:22,390
really try to first coach that person

467
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:23,620
and if that person is uncoachable then

468
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,700
you can just tell them like here I'm

469
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,530
gonna start writing you up for this

470
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,820
behavior and then you're out definitely

471
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:30,160
do write up so if you can't just fire

472
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:31,990
them because then you know liabilities

473
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:39,880
and whatnot

474
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:42,910
yes ma'am yes we are yes and turns for

475

476
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:46,180
