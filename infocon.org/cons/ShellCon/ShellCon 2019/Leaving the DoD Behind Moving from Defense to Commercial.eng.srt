1
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:25,699
okay wait we'll just get started all

2
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,669
right okay so this is a pretty quick

3
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:30,439
thing I only got like 20 minutes so I

4
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,329
have points but I've marched in the

5
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:34,160
conversation if you guys want to talk so

6
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:37,430
just quick background about me

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,019
Charlie Tennant Colonel went defense

8
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,160
contractor when I first came out I

9
00:00:39,019 --> 00:00:41,360
didn't like it at all

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,940
I wanted to get out of it it was

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,430
difficult I found my way out and now I

12
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,110
work straight commercial work as a

13
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:51,199
director for security and infrastructure

14
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:52,670
where I'm at and I work for a it's a

15
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,589
it's a non-profit but not like you might

16
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,480
think it's a very well funded nonprofit

17
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:59,780
that supports the motion picture

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,218
industries and we do benefits continuity

19
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,320
for all the people behind the scenes and

20
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:04,879
the movies like your grips your gaffers

21
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,759
those kind of folks when they do union

22
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,550
work and they move from place to place

23
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:12,289
they maintain their benefits by being by

24
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,460
all their contributions coming to us and

25
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:15,020
so because they change companies so

26
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,750
often this is how their unions maintain

27
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,070
benefits so that's where I work and so

28
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,259
sensors report about the movie industry

29
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:23,720
we're very well funded nonprofit which

30
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:25,759
is a good place to be let me tell you so

31
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,560
anyway but who do I have here with me

32
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,080
today we have we have veterans in here

33
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,160
all right good okay I got four we got

34
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,630
people trying to you guys trying to get

35
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,179
are you in DoD stuff now you want to get

36
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:37,880
out that's the goal okay how it yourself

37
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:41,209
what's your okay yeah all right okay so

38
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:43,458
I mean I have my points here but so the

39
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:44,539
first thing one talk about is why do you

40
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:46,280
want to leave government servers behind

41
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:47,149
right there's there's there's reasons

42
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,209
that I work out for you and those

43
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:52,550
reasons that walk okay personally I was

44
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:54,800
just done with supporting the DoD I just

45
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:57,800
I'd kind of had enough I did my time 20

46
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,000
years I'd come back to do defense

47
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,500
contract work because I needed a job

48
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,539
when I got out of the military and it

49
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,129
was easy to do right easy easier to get

50
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:07,009
a job we can talk about that in a second

51
00:02:04,129 --> 00:02:11,390
though in the military industrial

52
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:13,280
complex and it was not - but but there

53
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,690
are some reasons that are like bad to

54
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,099
leave like someone give me a reason why

55
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,720
you want to get out of DoD or government

56
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:20,510
service like like go ahead

57
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,819
what's red tape okay so there's

58
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:24,079
bureaucracy out in the commercial world

59
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:25,549
man right all right it's not going to go

60
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,129
away okay so make sure you know that

61
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:29,180
right it's there's plenty of red tape in

62
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:31,129
the military and the government complex

63
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,420
absolutely but when you get to your

64
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:34,159
company depending how big it is or

65
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,970
depending what size it is you're not

66
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,840
gonna escape

67
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:41,240
okay so so that's just a reason to you

68
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,180
know don't run away from the problems

69
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,950
you have in the government government

70
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:48,350
work with like bureaucracy with like bad

71
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:50,089
management that kind of stuff like it

72
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,950
the commercial world is not any better

73
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,210
it just depends where you're at and if

74
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,619
you get lucky you meet the good managers

75
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:57,950
you meet good folks yeah you can do

76
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:59,240
great if you just looking for a

77
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,589
different purpose to your life when

78
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,560
you're something different that's the

79
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:05,540
best reason to leave okay not to avoid

80
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,890
things that are bad in organizations I'm

81
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,390
just trying to be truthful up here okay

82
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:10,700
so just keep that in mind as you're

83
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:12,920
trying to leave what else what I have in

84
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,739
here I have some other stuff on here

85
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,540
like like like moving like maybe you're

86
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,840
tired of moving like if you're

87
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,650
active-duty military move a lot and

88
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,410
maybe you're tired of that and you can

89
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:26,660
absolutely find a physical location that

90
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:28,010
you want to plan yourself in but you may

91
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,990
not promote the way you think you will

92
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,220
if you don't want to move okay so these

93
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:35,060
are just some truths of the commercial

94
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:36,440
world you can stay put 100% but if

95
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,060
you're in a big company like I know like

96
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,800
a like for motor company or something

97
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,020
like that their executive team moves

98
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,270
every two to three years all the time

99
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,680
I've met some I know them they they're

100
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:47,390
they're always being moved because they

101
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,400
want them just like the military to

102
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:51,049
experience all kinds of different parts

103
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,430
of the company so that we have the ready

104
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:56,020
to lead when they get to that point in

105
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:59,870
their life so you may not escape moving

106
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:01,160
and so you know for me the best reason

107
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,260
to leave the military or government

108
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,940
stuff is that you're just done working

109
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,950
in that career field you you want to try

110
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,780
something different okay that's the

111
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,708
mental state you have to have because

112
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,890
you're gonna have a lot of the same

113
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:15,230
problems that exist in the military and

114
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:18,260
in government service a bad management

115
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:21,709
of bought bosses that are like like

116
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:23,030
overly demanding or or denigrate you or

117
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:25,220
make funny it's like it doesn't change

118
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:29,179
that stuff exists across the world

119
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:30,440
across all the all the industries so so

120
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,640
if one thing want you to consider is why

121
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:36,350
you want to leave so make sure you think

122
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:38,000
about that let's see who here thinks are

123
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:40,370
gonna get amazing pay soon as you leave

124
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,750
the military you guys have that that

125
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,620
myth that that thing that happens

126
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,660
everyone thinks it's going to happen

127
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,860
that when you leave government service

128
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,110
especially if you're in a listed

129
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,770
individual and the early part of your

130
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,480
career

131
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:52,729
you may think you're gonna pop out now

132
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,260
you're making 25k 30k a year you're

133
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:56,810
gonna make six figures immediately it's

134
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:58,610
not that simple okay it can't happen it

135
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,500
does happen but it can be very difficult

136
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,240
to find that money and it's almost

137
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,340
certainly gonna be as a defense

138
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,380
contractor if you're gonna go straight

139
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,570
commercial out of like a four to six

140
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,580
year enlisted career you're not gonna

141
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:13,219
end up in the high pay bands right away

142
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,359
you can get there absolutely but you

143
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,890
need to be prepared that it's not gonna

144
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,210
be like this I walk out next thing I'm

145
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:19,969
making six figures unless you're gonna

146
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:21,650
trade on your clearances and your tech

147
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:24,830
skills they taught you like for example

148
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,909
a lunch lady there was a sonar tech and

149
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,900
she don't want you sonar tech when she

150
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,090
got out

151
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,620
and so she absolutely could have gone to

152
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,880
work for Lockheed and BAE and all these

153
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,140
companies that build sonar CH probably

154
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,909
could have made pretty decent money she

155
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,979
probably could have done expatriate work

156
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:40,580
like doing sonar support in the Persian

157
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:41,900
Gulf they made a ton of money but but

158
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,760
that's the only way she could have made

159
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,469
that money when she wanted to jump in

160
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,860
the cyber security it's a much harder

161
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:50,750
road to go to change your skill set your

162
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,360
career said you think as a senior

163
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,680
officer there's a chance you may get

164
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,840
into some good stuff but I'm here to

165
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,250
tell you that I watched many of my peers

166
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,229
I was the first of my peer group to kind

167
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,050
of retire I watched many my peers

168
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:05,060
struggle on LinkedIn and then their

169
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:07,790
first job posting out of military

170
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:10,130
services is a basically a frontline

171
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:11,990
junior engineer at a company now these

172
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:13,940
are typically defense contractor jobs so

173
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:17,840
they pay well but it's it's basically

174
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:20,719
entry-level job and so you have to be

175
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,729
prepared for that kind of stuff to move

176
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,680
along you to trade on your your military

177
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:26,600
career and service in order to get a

178
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,690
high paying job or be prepared to take a

179
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:32,180
step back for instance when I got out I

180
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,980
really really got into red teaming stuff

181
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,380
I got my osep you guys all know what

182
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,610
that is okay I got my osep it was great

183
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,219
I was like this is great I wanna do this

184
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:42,110
man oh man there is no way I was gonna

185
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,370
get the pay level I needed to support my

186
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,670
family especially living in Los Angeles

187
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:49,490
that was a choice my family made that

188
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:51,770
was gonna allow me to do that job as a

189
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,910
red teamer it wasn't gonna work and so I

190
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,830
ended up getting some you know

191
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:56,930
managerial blue team job yeah Tomer

192
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:59,169
director and it did work out fine I

193
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:01,520
found blue team to be actually quite

194
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:02,480
quite energizing and staying how to

195
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,299
think that keeping the movie

196
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,100
long as you're in the right company okay

197
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,140
so that actually leads me into my next

198
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,820
point about when you want to move away

199
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,830
from government work you need to pick

200
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,390
the mission you need or not pick a

201
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:16,099
mission specifically but you need to

202
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,780
believe in the mission of the commercial

203
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,130
company you're gonna go work for okay

204
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:22,159
because they're gonna demand a lot of

205
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:23,659
you the especially is IT especially the

206
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,740
security and you need to know that

207
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,630
you're doing something you like for

208
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,460
instance I'm protecting the healthcare

209
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:30,620
records and pension data for all these

210
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:33,140
guys that all these folks pardon me that

211
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:34,670
are sorry in the in the motion picture

212
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:37,280
industry all these carpenters that kind

213
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:40,160
of stuff that that's what I'm protecting

214
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,469
and I find that a satisfying mission you

215
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,240
know like when I was first coming out we

216
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:45,950
living in Florida when I retired and

217
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,200
we're in coming to LA after my wife's

218
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:50,120
family is and so we're coming here and

219
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,190
I'm like okay I know la la Hollywood I'm

220
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,600
like man I know about working in

221
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:56,990
Hollywood I was just all I could think

222
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,220
about was sex drugs and rock and roll I

223
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,290
was like it was like it was like is this

224
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,600
gonna appeal to me as an individual

225
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:05,720
leaving a you know a very formal

226
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,310
environment especially as personally I

227
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,450
ran a pretty formal shop as a leader in

228
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:10,430
the military because that's what we're

229
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:13,430
expected of us as leaders in the

230
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:14,540
military keep the standards high and you

231
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,520
know in the last two years of my career

232
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,020
we you know it's all doing like the huge

233
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,400
push against sexual harassment and

234
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:21,440
sexual assault in the military and so

235
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,609
standards were raising and I didn't

236
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,620
wanna go back I didn't want to go back

237
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:27,890
to a world where that was what was being

238
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:31,040
kind of defeated and honored and so I

239
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:32,539
was really worried about it and you know

240
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,770
then I so I got this defense contractor

241
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:36,079
job and so I was in the kind of same

242
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:37,970
environment which is fine but then I

243
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,860
started like doing recruiting for that

244
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:41,060
company so we go to these fairs and so

245
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,919
there would be my line I worked for

246
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:46,699
mitre at the time my line like hey mitre

247
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:48,410
guy next to me was kinder and tinder had

248
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,420
a line out the door the people that one

249
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:57,920
of the work for them and nobody wanted

250
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:58,969
to come work for mitre and and so I was

251
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,709
doing some gut checking his tender

252
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,270
higher security people like crazy and I

253
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,500
was like and I'm like is that what I

254
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:05,300
want to do is this a mission that

255
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,190
appeals to me it turns out no I'm not

256
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:10,579
into that mission even though my wife

257
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:12,530
and I met online 17 years ago it wasn't

258
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:14,870
the same kind of meeting online that it

259
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:15,829
is now especially especially tinder

260
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:18,650
culture it was

261
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:20,240
culture back then and so it didn't

262
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:22,100
appeal to me so I had to avoid those

263
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,740
things I had to avoid I started looking

264
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:27,830
at oh geez what's the the League of

265
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:30,920
Legends guys the big company here dang

266
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:33,050
it but what's that yeah yes Riot Games

267
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,490
so I started looking at Riot Games this

268
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,410
is before they had their articles that

269
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,720
came out about the the talks the toxic

270
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:40,430
nature of their culture I was reading

271
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,780
through the job ads it was like we want

272
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:43,609
people to take their Penta kills as

273
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:47,839
seriously as they take their you know as

274
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:50,060
their work and I was like you know my

275
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:52,160
favorite game is a CTF I like to do like

276
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,989
stuff like that I don't I don't get joy

277
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,770
at a video games anymore I used to it's

278
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,510
not my thing

279
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,010
so I'm just saying be very careful about

280
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,120
the mission you want to accept because

281
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:01,250
as a person who is served in the

282
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,900
military served in government you served

283
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:05,360
a mission a bigger mission you're used

284
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,620
to that and it may be hard to contract

285
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,790
yourself into something that actually

286
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,260
feels pretty small to you when you

287
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:11,870
finally get into it might be getting

288
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:13,730
paid well you might have off fun it

289
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:15,170
might be interesting perks but that

290
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,490
mission doesn't ring your bell you're

291
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:18,790
probably not gonna like the job long

292
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:23,960
term so just keep that in mind

293
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:26,089
comments or questions on that okay all

294
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,850
right so how do I prepare to jump

295
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:29,870
so around like the 17 year point

296
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:32,060
eighteen year point I knew I was getting

297
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:34,580
out 20 there was no oh six jobs I wanted

298
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:37,369
not a single one appeal to me so I was

299
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,600
like it's time for me to leave and so I

300
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,920
started with something that's a little

301
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,230
bit unpopular right now I started with

302
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,000
certifications and I'm here to tell you

303
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:45,500
like there's a lot of noise about stirs

304
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,960
like especially if you follow the b-side

305
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,760
circuit with uh with whiskey Jack Daniel

306
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,040
he'll be like like you know he's he's

307
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,080
the most anti CISSP guy you can possibly

308
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,819
meet I'm here to tell you stuff like

309
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,740
that stuff in the closet you get your

310
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,180
goddamn serve all right

311
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,040
get them all get all the ones you can

312
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,599
afford to and go get on your own and

313
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,490
don't wait for them because the person

314
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,440
who's gonna get that job has this earth

315
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,480
you want to make a principled stance

316
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,580
against certain certs wait till you're a

317
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,830
hiring authority and change the hiring

318
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:15,830
practices for your company okay you

319
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:17,900
can't do it as a as an entrant employee

320
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:20,450
the job I have now I would never would

321
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,470
have gotten without my CISSP I wouldn't

322
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:24,410
even made it past the first phone call

323
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:27,770
with HR and that's just the fact of the

324
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:29,810
matter in our world the the civilian

325
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,889
world demands certifications

326
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:32,268
if you don't get them you're just

327
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:34,819
fighting a system that you cannot win

328
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:36,889
now might you be an event like this and

329
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:38,479
you meet a person and he trades cards

330
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:40,430
and you end up getting hired from that

331
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,730
of course but it's a little probability

332
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:47,149
play okay so get your search get your

333
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:51,199
stuff together the next thing I did to

334
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:53,990
prepare myself is I decided hey I'm

335
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:56,359
gonna make a hack I'm gonna submit it to

336
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:59,120
Def Con and guess what I had never been

337
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,579
a Def Con and I built a hack and my very

338
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,699
first time at Def Con was as a speaker

339
00:12:00,579 --> 00:12:06,319
okay so oh no that's not normal it

340
00:12:04,699 --> 00:12:07,670
doesn't happen very often in fact I

341
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:09,680
haven't had my success since then

342
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:11,689
getting into Def Con as a speaker I

343
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:15,138
spoke this past year and the demo demo

344
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:15,949
laughs so I didn't get mainstage these

345
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:17,540
are things you need to set yourself

346
00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:20,209
apart so don't don't aim at Def Con aim

347
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:22,370
at besides Vegas and you met aim at

348
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:23,959
Shell con aim it besides San Francisco

349
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:26,839
there's tons of things you can aim at

350
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:28,279
but find something interested in write a

351
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:31,519
paper on it submit it and then

352
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:33,230
eventually come up and talk it's whether

353
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,019
you get a job that way or not or any

354
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:37,809
notoriety that way it is a great piece

355
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:39,680
of fodder for your interview cycle and

356
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:40,490
anyone who has anything in the business

357
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,349
feel like you spoke at a conference

358
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:43,459
though it rings their Bell whether they

359
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:45,199
well they've even been to those

360
00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:47,239
conferences or not they know that it's

361
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:48,979
amazing that you have spoken so they

362
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,970
will so it just helps it's a nice little

363
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,189
thing to put the bottom of your resume

364
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:54,800
hey relevant things I also do stuff like

365
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:57,019
published in 2600 blog posts anything

366
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,878
you can do LinkedIn articles just to get

367
00:12:57,019 --> 00:13:00,910
your name you need to do it and actually

368
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:03,889
and whether you think it's like

369
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:05,480
showboating or make thought leadership

370
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:07,910
which can be a negative term on certain

371
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,410
circles these days or not it actually

372
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,639
helps you refine your ideas and

373
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:13,459
techniques and things that you're

374
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,660
interested in and I've learned a lot

375
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,439
just by trying to speak and then you

376
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,389
meet people and you have great

377
00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:19,550
conversations with those so I really

378
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:22,069
recommend attempting that if you haven't

379
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:24,769
put in for a paper to talk do it there's

380
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:26,300
no downside last time to get good

381
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:28,519
feedback if you ask for it specifically

382
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,459
even in Def Con if you like specifically

383
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:32,600
hitting akita up and be like hey why not

384
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:34,878
you'll get something back more even

385
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,490
though she's busy as hell so you can

386
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:38,990
learn a lot that way if you've been to

387
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:42,230
some of these conferences you'll find

388
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:43,610
that they are general a mix of stuff

389
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,810
that is like

390
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:46,040
so simple you don't understand why

391
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:49,130
they're talking about it at a conference

392
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,449
and completely incomprehensible right so

393
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:52,040
you fit in there somewhere

394
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:53,660
I'm here to tell you'll fit in there

395
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,689
like I've gone to blackhat and seen

396
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:58,610
talks on fishing and USB keys being left

397
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,350
in parking lots I'm like we're still

398
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:03,020
talking about that at blackhat are you

399
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:04,610
kidding me but they are so you never

400
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,930
feel never feel negative anything you

401
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,860
want to do and but make sure it's

402
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,270
something you're interested in because

403
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,550
then it'll be a good talk and you

404
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,730
actually learn a lot and have fun all

405
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,740
right

406
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:21,080
question on talks are applying to

407
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:22,430
conferences anything like that yes the

408
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:25,400
more data you can provide the absolute

409
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:28,310
better so my first talk the one I did at

410
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,990
Def Con was I I written a white paper I

411
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:31,430
had a working everything worked like

412
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:33,080
everything was done all's I did was

413
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:34,849
finally just submit it when the window

414
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:38,420
opened and always best to submit early

415
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:40,190
because like Derby uses to submit their

416
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,660
stats would be like okay this is the

417
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:45,380
trickle of Derby stuff and then two days

418
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:47,540
before CFD closed and so but everything

419
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,770
that was really it got read it already

420
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:52,089
been seen so you're already in their

421
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:54,319
mind so I always say submit early and

422
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:55,880
and then write detailed white papers

423
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,830
about it like like there's always a

424
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,960
minimum thing that you have to fill out

425
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:03,290
to submit they'll be like Oh give us a

426
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:04,370
outline and any you know they'll always

427
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:07,339
be like anything else you want to add

428
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:09,770
man link stuff like link your github

429
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:11,210
link your link your like show that it's

430
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,470
a working product and you can do it

431
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,870
I actually got away with it this past

432
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:17,030
year where I my stuff was barely working

433
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,290
when I submitted and being a much

434
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:21,589
different talk when I finally got to the

435
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:23,410
end but but I got away with it because

436
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:25,700
now when I submit for talks I can say

437
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:27,740
they'll say hey link to talks you've

438
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:30,710
given and I've got like four or five on

439
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:42,110
line now and so you can do that so you

440
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:44,810
get a little when I submitted the CFP

441
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:47,180
the the idea was solid but the working

442
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:48,680
code was not so I don't think I even had

443
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:51,170
published it on github yet I didn't push

444
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,819
it the github until it was working and I

445
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:56,270
had and I made a bunch of how to's and

446
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:57,410
that kind of stuff but but the idea was

447
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:59,360
at least attractive

448
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:03,050
not that they let me talk with a frankly

449
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,430
fairly unfinished present idea when I

450
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:07,609
submitted so I kind of got away with it

451
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:09,620
but but my first one main stage Def Con

452
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:12,079
was a fully fleshed out thing fully

453
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:13,879
working I said working co-working

454
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:18,439
everything out to the CFP folks and I

455
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:19,970
mean I was in so but don't necessarily

456
00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:21,769
wait till the very last minute to do

457
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:23,329
that kind of stuff that's why I needed

458
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:24,920
something passionate it took me two

459
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:26,089
years about that Def Con hack it took me

460
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,979
a year to build the one I just briefed

461
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:29,089
last year you have to be into it right

462
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,470
so don't just pick something you're not

463
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:32,569
cool with just because you want to talk

464
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:33,649
about you want to talk like hey I want

465
00:16:32,569 --> 00:16:35,089
to work on that I would want to get good

466
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:37,220
at it and then you would make a great

467
00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:38,199
talk all right I'm running out of time I

468
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,490
believe

469
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:41,990
let's see resume they've had all kinds

470
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:44,149
of resume reviewers here I'm just gonna

471
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:46,220
go over like demilitarize it as much as

472
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:49,339
possible since I applied for management

473
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:51,860
positions when I got out I had like like

474
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:55,040
lieutenant spatial experiments captain

475
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:57,019
you know all this kind of crap yeah yeah

476
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,610
I have this stuff and I was like I broke

477
00:16:57,019 --> 00:16:59,930
it down I said I said junior management

478
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,790
middle management senior management and

479
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:03,469
I put in like the big big picture items

480
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:05,480
in there okay

481
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:08,209
and so that resume is the one that got

482
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,039
me my job and resumes aren't enough like

483
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:12,169
everybody else I had black hold resumes

484
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:15,349
everywhere like just gone like you said

485
00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:17,659
you're gonna visit JPL JPL black hole no

486
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:19,969
response this job that I got is the only

487
00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:22,520
resume where I literally hunted down the

488
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,600
head of HR and call her after I sent my

489
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,990
resume and it's like did you get my

490
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,928
resume

491
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:28,669
I'm like just full-on cocky bs just like

492
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:29,840
hey you know and I didn't have been

493
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:32,059
talking to her I ended up talking to

494
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,168
like a junior HR person but the point is

495
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:35,629
I would never gotten that phone call I

496
00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:39,080
hadn't even followed up so if it's a job

497
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:40,610
you really want or follow up like

498
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,530
finally it's not hard therefore throw

499
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:43,610
everyone LinkedIn and once are on

500
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,230
LinkedIn then they just called the

501
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:47,270
company switchboard Nast one by name and

502
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:50,090
use your social engineering skills it

503
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:52,070
doesn't it's not hard get in touch with

504
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:53,090
the people that make the decisions at

505
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,530
least get you through the door

506
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:56,629
I always knew if I could interview I

507
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:59,210
would probably get hired but I could not

508
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:00,740
get an interview tons of black hole

509
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:02,750
black hole resumes over and over again

510
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,950
before I was out and then when I was

511
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,419
actually out I didn't like mitre and I

512
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:07,220
wanted to get out of mitre black hole

513
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:11,270
black hole black hole you have to follow

514
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:12,410
up simple is that let's see

515
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:15,080
what the book is gonna bring I have a

516
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:16,310
book called rites of passage it's a if

517
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,919
you look at it it's called rites of

518
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:20,060
passage like how to get that six-figure

519
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,420
Plus job or whatever it's about

520
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:25,159
executive job hunting and it's a little

521
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,600
bit corny and cheating some it's writing

522
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:30,980
but it has some really good suggestions

523
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:33,649
on interview techniques and I really

524
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:35,750
meant to bring it I apologize and it's

525
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:37,550
like you should have a 60 second answer

526
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:40,070
to every question that is asked and

527
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:41,330
that's really about it 60 seconds you

528
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:44,389
shouldn't just be babbling on alone

529
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:46,310
should have your set thing of of what

530
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:47,750
you did or what the problem was what you

531
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:49,490
did and how it improved the problem that

532
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,390
existed one of the problems we have one

533
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,490
of the biggest problems we have about

534
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:54,290
leaving DoD and government service into

535
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:56,390
into a for-profit industry is that we

536
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:58,790
have no record of showing we can handle

537
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:59,840
a for-profit world we can I can't I

538
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:02,300
can't show you anything I increase

539
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,409
revenue by 80% I can't do it so you have

540
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,120
to talk about problem solving

541
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:07,520
we need tons of that in the military

542
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,679
that's that's our every day but make

543
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,450
sure you sell that stuff so so practice

544
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:14,420
those stories write them down get that

545
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:16,580
book it has like it has like a yes

546
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,780
that's the one and and I will warn it

547
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:20,480
like there's some corny stuff in there

548
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:21,680
man I'm not gonna lie but but the stuff

549
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,360
of interviewing is great and there's a

550
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,970
whole section on dealing with corporate

551
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,919
recruiters which was my stream Lee

552
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,880
educational there is a lot to learn

553
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,280
about how to deal with recruiters

554
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,810
correctly so you don't get screwed and

555
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,149
so I highly recommend reading it for

556
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:37,970
those purposes alone

557
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:39,140
let's see if I per recruiters branding

558
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:40,400
oh I jumped ahead I did a branding

559
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:43,100
already which is basically speaking at

560
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,330
conferences you need to have something

561
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,120
that sets you apart from the from the

562
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:48,889
field the big joke of course hiring

563
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,149
insecurity is everyone wants an

564
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:53,180
entry-level person but they want six

565
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:55,970
years of experience right it's extremely

566
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:57,170
weird and and and and you know even as a

567
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:59,570
hiring Authority now I find myself

568
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:01,070
writing the same things these like one

569
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,740
of my guys leads and this is I'm a kind

570
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:05,120
of small shop he did all this and I want

571
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:07,100
to hire for all that but my company

572
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,850
won't pay for all that and so so then

573
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,340
how do I do it

574
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:11,750
but having these things on your resume

575
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:14,270
set yourself apart and even it's just

576
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:15,650
like oh my security blog the thousand

577
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:17,690
followers whatever just anything to show

578
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:19,670
that you are trying to learn the most

579
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:21,260
and get your get word out there your

580
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:23,899
personal brand is important to get

581
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:27,059
through the door for a hiring Authority

582
00:20:23,899 --> 00:20:29,580
all right any questions on a esta

583
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:42,629
comments we want to talk about anything

584
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:45,210
particular alright let's see well

585
00:20:42,629 --> 00:20:46,709
unfortunately haven't interviewed in

586
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,720
like three years now so sorry so now

587
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,850
you're catching me flat-footed but I

588
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,279
think so I was a commander squadron

589
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:55,529
commander yeah and and I had this unit

590
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:56,820
and I was pretty small unit and there

591
00:20:55,529 --> 00:20:59,549
was a sister unit it was three times my

592
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:01,769
size and then my time I was done with my

593
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:03,929
little unit we were producing five times

594
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:05,190
what that unit did that's the kind of

595
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,229
story that resonates even with a

596
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:08,909
for-profit individual I didn't increase

597
00:21:07,229 --> 00:21:11,879
the size of my company or the size of my

598
00:21:08,909 --> 00:21:15,269
team I used them better and and we were

599
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:16,228
setting the standards for it so that's

600
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:17,309
the kind of thing you're talking about

601
00:21:16,229 --> 00:21:19,379
so any kind of project like that

602
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:21,349
anything where you cut man-hours or

603
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:23,488
efficiency or if you're going into a

604
00:21:21,349 --> 00:21:25,619
into a compliance company or a

605
00:21:23,489 --> 00:21:27,359
compliance job well so I mean I don't

606
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:29,039
how many even survive Inspector General

607
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:30,989
things but that's what those are right

608
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,529
in the inspector general audits

609
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:33,749
inspections

610
00:21:31,529 --> 00:21:35,429
it's a compliance inspection so you can

611
00:21:33,749 --> 00:21:36,690
talk about if you let any compliance

612
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:38,399
work about how you did it and how you

613
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:39,960
survive you know and we got you know an

614
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:42,418
excellent and a three-day pass you know

615
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,679
just all those kinds of things that you

616
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:46,409
can you can bring up but your your

617
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,289
records full of it full of good

618
00:21:46,409 --> 00:21:50,940
information about things that you did

619
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:53,220
and make sure that you learn to talk

620
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:56,009
about them and I don't know how it is

621
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:57,840
even amongst the officer world like

622
00:21:56,009 --> 00:21:59,700
sometimes they make edits to your OPR

623
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,369
before it's signed and things get on

624
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,479
there that you didn't actually do don't

625
00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:05,668
talk about those things don't take

626
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:07,440
credit for them I don't rely on your

627
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:08,729
resume it takes about three and a half

628
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,899
seconds to catch a person lying on their

629
00:22:08,729 --> 00:22:12,479
resume and it's the first thing we do

630
00:22:09,899 --> 00:22:13,619
when you come into my office is like I

631
00:22:12,479 --> 00:22:15,179
have a guy came in to say new head he's

632
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:17,129
Metasploit I was like oh okay well

633
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:21,409
what's the Consul look like he's like

634
00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:24,209
well you know it's it's got letters

635
00:22:21,409 --> 00:22:24,599
you're like you're like oh cool all

636
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,859
right

637
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:27,509
yeah I think he even said he used

638
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:29,189
Armitage it's like oh oh like you know

639
00:22:27,509 --> 00:22:32,659
how do you attach to a host like well

640
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:34,679
you know then you what's the menu say

641
00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:37,590
anyway it doesn't take long so don't

642
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:39,029
take credit for things you don't have I

643
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:41,070
we'll say something that resumes is in

644
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:42,419
our career especially IT we often tend

645
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,590
to learn things and then move on and

646
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:45,870
then we don't remember how to use them

647
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:47,100
right I list those as latent skills I

648
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:48,750
don't want to I don't want to ignore

649
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,730
them I want people to know that I have

650
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:52,559
done it but I literally say latent

651
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:54,840
skills it's like like I've done this in

652
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,399
the past I can do it again but if you

653
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,649
asked me to do it like live right now

654
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,720
I'm probably gonna fail it's gonna take

655
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:02,279
me a few hours right so I think it's

656
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,529
there's a lot of value in that like I

657
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:05,850
mean I've written in I don't know half

658
00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:08,100
dozen languages but only one I use right

659
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:11,428
now is Python if you if you throw me

660
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:13,139
into a C++ thing I've done it absolutely

661
00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:16,110
I wrote an entire app for the iPhone and

662
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:17,789
C++ yeah but I don't really remember it

663
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:20,039
all that well and anything complicated

664
00:23:17,789 --> 00:23:22,110
like a recursive tree search I couldn't

665
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:24,419
get that question right I'm just not so

666
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:27,719
I listed as latent skills so something

667
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:29,640
you can keep in mind I wanna talk a

668
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,779
little bit about what it's like being a

669
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,149
military person going to a straight

670
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:35,340
commercial world about what kind of good

671
00:23:33,149 --> 00:23:36,418
things to expect and despondency for

672
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,120
everybody everyone's experience are

673
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:42,179
different but do you know how hard it is

674
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,500
to get a vanilla commercial person just

675
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:46,950
to show up on time for work every

676
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:50,059
morning it's really hard it can be I got

677
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:52,260
five minutes okay so just showing up

678
00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:53,730
keeping your task list getting them done

679
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,210
and turning them in is enough to get you

680
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:56,610
noticed

681
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:57,779
all right so and then if you take that

682
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:59,158
extra step you start doing some

683
00:23:57,779 --> 00:24:01,470
initiative you're really gonna stand out

684
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:03,059
so you bring a lot to the team you bring

685
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:05,460
a lot of responsibility and personable

686
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:07,350
accountability that other folks don't

687
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,730
have and don't undersell yourself on

688
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:10,439
that stuff and you know and that's your

689
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:11,250
brand as well like you're always there

690
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,419
you're always getting the work done

691
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:15,049
you're doing it quick and then things

692
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:15,049
will grow from there

693
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:22,919
leaders in the military I have found my

694
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,750
my background especially since I was in

695
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:26,700
the Pentagon for four years the my

696
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:28,440
ability to work organizational processes

697
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:31,860
I can run rings around all my all my

698
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,149
commercial counterparts all that red

699
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,678
tape and stuff that you don't like about

700
00:24:33,149 --> 00:24:36,178
the military has taught you how to deal

701
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:37,409
with it in ways that they don't know how

702
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:40,470
to work they don't know how to deal with

703
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:42,539
use that and and you'll get things done

704
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:43,830
and people will be amazed my two

705
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:46,379
security engineers that work for me now

706
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:48,000
they within I know six months of me

707
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,559
being there like like we've never seen

708
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,690
so much money being given to our

709
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:53,519
department before like how you do it

710
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:55,350
like well I just I build my thing and

711
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,240
they like no like you're like the third

712
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:58,668
person who's worked here and none of you

713
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,720
can't get the money you know like well

714
00:24:58,669 --> 00:25:01,919
these are skills you learned like

715
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,759
especially the Pentagon right

716
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:07,559
it's all very cutthroat if any enlisted

717
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:09,659
leaders or even officer leaders in here

718
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:11,730
I discovered that my concern for

719
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:12,870
individual's well-being like to the

720
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:14,250
point of asking a lot of personal

721
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:15,629
questions was a little off-putting to

722
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:18,419
this to the straight-up civilians at

723
00:25:15,629 --> 00:25:19,709
first they're not used to it then I used

724
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:20,970
to people actually legitimately carrying

725
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:23,539
you know when I asked those questions I

726
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:24,720
asked for a position of absolute care I

727
00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:26,039
can

728
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,360
that's why my units did good that's why

729
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:28,710
the airmen that work for me did good

730
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,758
that's why people who work with me do

731
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:33,720
well it's cuz I generally care about

732
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:35,190
them as people that's rare use it and if

733
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,840
they're off they're put off by at first

734
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:37,860
eventually they'll stop being put off by

735
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,240
it as long as it's coming from a

736
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:42,959
position of real care and not just

737
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:44,340
gossip nusiness right so like one of the

738
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,559
things that specifically if the person

739
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:48,570
isn't show up for work on time and I

740
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,820
always ask hey I'll be ask hey is

741
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:52,320
everything okay they think they need to

742
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,610
defend themselves but why doesn't show

743
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,799
up on time I'm like no you don't get it

744
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:57,508
like are you okay as a person is

745
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:58,620
everything okay in your life we'll deal

746
00:25:57,509 --> 00:26:00,600
with the fact you can show up on time a

747
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:02,070
little bit let's get over this this

748
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,949
issue with whatever is going on your

749
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:06,870
life right so just be aware that that

750
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:10,980
may put the people off but I found they

751
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:12,449
respond to it and so let me see you let

752
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:14,759
me I had some just final statements here

753
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:15,509
so my advice for first time security

754
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:17,309
professionals if you're going to

755
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:18,809
security of the hole is feel if casa t

756
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:20,399
and self-directed research never stop

757
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:22,049
find things you don't understand and

758
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:25,439
learn them every day

759
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:26,940
and don't be afraid as a whole managers

760
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,679
expect security pros to be versatile

761
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,659
curious and dogged in the search of

762
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:31,860
answers if I ask you a question as your

763
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:34,289
boss don't come to me with questions

764
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:35,850
like research the hell of that thing

765
00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:37,200
until you're stuck and then come back so

766
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:39,360
here's everything I've tried I can't get

767
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,490
to work what next but don't just be like

768
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:46,439
what now what now it doesn't work in the

769
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:48,629
security field let's see the only the

770
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,889
only caveat to that is if you are

771
00:26:48,629 --> 00:26:52,320
security analyst and you think you've

772
00:26:49,889 --> 00:26:54,418
infected a breach do not keep that

773
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,950
information to yourself even if you're

774
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:57,539
not on your percent sure that

775
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:59,190
information does not age will under any

776
00:26:57,539 --> 00:27:00,960
circumstance so make sure you talk bring

777
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:02,759
it up my last piece of advice to a

778
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,080
security professional learn how to use

779
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:07,910
Excel

780
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:09,678
yeah yeah yeah you can use Excel a lot

781
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:11,679
no matter what alright I think I'm dumb

782
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,730
at any quick questions for me anybody

783
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,230
I'll be hanging around for a little bit

784
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:16,730
around you if you can't find me I'm

785
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:19,460
probably on the competition floor kind

786
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:22,760
of learn and so I've got this backpack

787
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:26,350
easiest way to recognize me there you go

788
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,350
thanks guys appreciate it

789
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,060
