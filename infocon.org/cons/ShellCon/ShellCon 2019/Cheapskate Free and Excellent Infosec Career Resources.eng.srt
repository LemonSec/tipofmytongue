1
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,610
I welcome ok if you're if you want the

2
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,560
sands one that's that's next door so

3
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,529
this is called cheapskate free and

4
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,790
excellent InfoSec career resources

5
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:34,170
basically there's a bunch of free

6
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,690
information out there especially if

7
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,460
you're getting started in InfoSec more

8
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,589
cybersecurity that I'm just trying to

9
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,110
least give you pointers to this is

10
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,390
available if you go to my LinkedIn page

11
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,040
snakes and chauncey Isis be if you go to

12
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,989
LinkedIn it should be there you should

13
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,600
be able to download it in PDF format so

14
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:54,479
if you want that if you want the slides

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,129
that's that's where they're located so a

16
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,080
little bit about me I've had basically

17
00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:00,360
three careers my first career out of

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,430
college was in flight simulation or I

19
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,409
did basically software development in

20
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,270
both trainers the first trainer I worked

21
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:09,450
on was a space shuttle down in Houston

22
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,789
Texas working on payloads and then later

23
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,280
on moved to military aircraft and then

24
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:18,960
moved to engineering simulators with

25
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:22,920
Boeing up in Seattle mainly the 747 not

26
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,770
the 737 and then from there I moved over

27
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,869
to software testing with the what I call

28
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,939
the Empire microsoft also up in Seattle

29
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:32,299
and staying there for a while until I

30
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:35,369
moved here to Southern California where

31
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:37,140
as I stomach story earlier I was

32
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:38,759
commuting with Jeff here and another

33
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,409
friend named Robert and we were

34
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,689
commuting front we were part carpooling

35
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:45,659
between Pasadena and in Huntington Beach

36
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:46,499
and Robert would evangelize to Jeff and

37
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,270
me especially me

38
00:01:46,499 --> 00:01:49,439
Security's a great thing to get into you

39
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,408
have software backgrounds you'll be able

40
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,178
to get into it you love it so he talked

41
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:56,069
you twisted to twist the Marmont into it

42
00:01:54,179 --> 00:01:58,549
so I've worked in defense career mobster

43
00:01:56,069 --> 00:02:01,170
software did work with some small

44
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:06,359
consulting companies in security I got

45
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:08,788
my CSP in 2011 and my CH in 2012 so the

46
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:11,038
agenda is a quick overview high C

47
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:14,220
information security and C cyber

48
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:16,140
security the next part is the bulk of

49
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,270
the bulk of the presentation there a lot

50
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,970
of links so that's why I don't that's

51
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:23,550
why I recommend you get the presentation

52
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:25,290
because the links are there local suit

53
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:28,350
of meetings to attend and a little bit

54
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,519
about certifications so this is how I

55
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,989
see security it's maybe a little

56
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,290
different if you were at the previous

57
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,890
presentation I see security in these

58
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,799
very

59
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:40,260
big three very big domains we're very

60
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,260
big categories like management

61
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,840
infrastructure and engineering these are

62
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,120
very the biomes between them are very

63
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,620
very fuzzy and it could be overlap and

64
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,420
there could be things that fit in

65
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,490
multiple categories but this is just how

66
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,230
I see things to help me keep things

67
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:57,120
organized in my head so I'm just letting

68
00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:01,500
you know this because this may help you

69
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,900
too so management are things involving

70
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,780
the organization that are not technical

71
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:09,360
that help keep your organization secure

72
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,670
things like policy procedures personnel

73
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,459
Human Resources legal compliance very

74
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:16,799
important compliance training so these

75
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:18,420
are things that help you help your

76
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,310
organization stay secure but not

77
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,109
necessarily technically oriented I also

78
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,390
add to this because it's people oriented

79
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:26,459
I add physical security just because

80
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,899
it's not it's it's it's it's related to

81
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:29,520
your organization but not directly

82
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,160
related to what your organization does

83
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:34,560
it reduces the second one is

84
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:38,160
infrastructure this is the stuff that

85
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,350
you need technically that helps your

86
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:44,609
organization get work done things like

87
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:47,010
your network your Wi-Fi your cloud your

88
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:50,190
wireless any third party applications

89
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:53,040
things like exchange outlook office

90
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:54,750
those are set software that you have but

91
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,340
that you need to have but it's not

92
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,200
anything something directly related to

93
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,989
it's not something you make or produce

94
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:04,380
yourself that's the infrastructure and

95
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:06,870
the third part is the third part is

96
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:10,709
engineering and that's the stuff that

97
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:13,769
your organization produces creates for

98
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:15,360
yours for for clients or for or

99
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:17,519
something that you create yourself that

100
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,840
includes anything that's that's the to

101
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,899
outsource so that'll be your website

102
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:23,609
your applications your services these

103
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:27,690
are these are three very big broad

104
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:29,640
things so as an example there's there

105
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:32,700
can be overlap like forensics forensics

106
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,289
is generally a requirement that you

107
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,789
think that you need to have like if you

108
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:39,229
have if you're in a sort of business a

109
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:41,880
bet that they may require some sort of

110
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:44,130
investigation when it's actually

111
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,130
executed it's against your network your

112
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:48,030
your data center your endpoints and

113
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,520
that's an infrastructure

114
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:53,309
and another one very popular with

115
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:56,849
newcomers is pen testing pen testing is

116
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:58,620
often a compliance issue managerial what

117
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,030
are you pen testing well one thing you

118
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,440
can pad test is getting into the

119
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,809
building social engineering people

120
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,730
managerial because it's people oriented

121
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:07,650
if you're pen testing their network

122
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:09,270
infrastructure your pen testing the

123
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:12,120
application or the website it's

124
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:14,280
engineering so it depends on an engineer

125
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,780
you call it the control volume it

126
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,880
depends on what your boundaries are your

127
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:20,039
point of view and what it is that you're

128
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,140
doing and how and how it fits into what

129
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,590
your organization are doing so that's so

130
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:27,270
these classifications are very broad and

131
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:31,950
it's very dependent on your point of

132
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:34,950
view so now to get to the free stuff the

133
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:36,630
there's a great place for a lot of free

134
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,460
stuff it's called it's the National

135
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:41,460
Institute for Standards technology of

136
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:44,580
the wise called NIST there is a page

137
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:46,799
that you see here of the computer

138
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:49,080
security Resource Center is very

139
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,690
extensive do tons of stacks and stacks

140
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,310
of information out there and I I

141
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,600
generally believe that they can be

142
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,640
considered Authority if I want to ask

143
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,990
Jeff Jeff or these unis be considered

144
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,700
authoritative okay they're considered a

145
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,840
sort of stay yeah at least at least in

146
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,150
the u.s. because it's very government

147
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,640
oriented do you have one this big

148
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:07,109
disadvantage it's really dry and it's a

149
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:10,080
pain in the neck to read because it's

150
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:11,400
like okay they could be very interesting

151
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,990
stuff a very useful stuff in there but

152
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,760
it's super dry reading but it's but

153
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:18,620
there's tons of information out there

154
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:20,729
for all these different things and and I

155
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,590
with only one exception I won't be

156
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:27,150
citing this anymore for the rest of this

157
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:31,560
presentation so this is the exception

158
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:33,870
there are two introductions to

159
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,850
information security one for any general

160
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:39,090
introduction and the one it's for

161
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:40,880
managers these are very government

162
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:43,409
oriented because the government

163
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,590
organizations have a tendency to have

164
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:49,020
these different positions for for

165
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:52,340
InfoSec and these are related these are

166
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:54,479
these are tilted in that direction so

167
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,969
they're useful but it's government

168
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,930
related so just keep that in mind when

169
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:01,430
you see it

170
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:04,030
cybersecurity is everyone's job I think

171
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:07,190
is a very useful document because it

172
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:09,679
talks about the different roles in an

173
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:12,530
organization and how cybersecurity fits

174
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,850
within that person's within each role I

175
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,950
think that's a very useful thing to know

176
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,870
it's very broad it's very high level and

177
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:19,820
of course it could be different for

178
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,080
different organizations but least has a

179
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,640
very high level thing I think it's a

180
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,109
good document to have it's a good

181
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,969
document to look at and be familiar with

182
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,800
especially depending especially if

183
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,510
you're not in - if you're not a

184
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,990
technical person because it talks about

185
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:36,020
things like finance administration and

186
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:37,160
so forth and how each role what each

187
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,719
role should know about cybersecurity

188
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,850
because it is something that everybody

189
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,890
in an organization should know and if

190
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:44,030
you're in an organization which doesn't

191
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:45,590
even practice this like a smaller

192
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:48,200
organization this is worth knowing and

193
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:51,320
saying and trying to use to get as a way

194
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,460
of getting everybody to learn what part

195
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,020
of cybersecurity should I be interested

196
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:57,080
in so I like that

197
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:59,270
the InfoSec handbook just published by a

198
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:03,440
press a press publishes a ton of books a

199
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:05,359
press open is a is a subset of books

200
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,390
that they make freely available to you

201
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,860
in an e in an ePub or PDF format so

202
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:11,930
those are all for anything under a press

203
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:14,120
open it's free they have one called the

204
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:16,490
InfoSec handbook people made different

205
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,320
on its usefulness but it's I think

206
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,940
better easier reading than in this stuff

207
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,790
and it's also a bit more comprehensive

208
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:25,340
it covers more covers more information

209
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:27,110
there's another book called in a press

210
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:30,049
of injustice I know called rethinking

211
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:32,240
the Internet of Things also a press of

212
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,039
and I think it was under consideration

213
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,340
for some awards but just something to

214
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:38,929
keep in mind

215
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:42,470
navigating the digital age was created

216
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:44,780
by the stock market people and Cisco and

217
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:46,070
it keeps it's more again it's a high

218
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,770
level thing mainly written for the

219
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:51,440
c-suite people just for that make them

220
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:52,550
know keep having them understand what

221
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,370
things they should keep in mind

222
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:56,900
concerning cybersecurity so toxin in

223
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:59,030
deceased in the c-suite line in the

224
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:01,370
c-suite language do the first edition is

225
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:03,290
freely available at the link the second

226
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:06,410
one requires a sign up second edition

227
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:08,719
requires to sign up another site that's

228
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:10,040
very useful with a lot of information is

229
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,930
the center for internet security and

230
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,610
then the CISOs guide for

231
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:16,430
all strings cybersecurity postures

232
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:17,990
basically collection of their blogs

233
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:20,510
it does require signup but it's still

234
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:22,490
free and the fenders dilemma ran is

235
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:25,970
another place which we're tons of free

236
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:28,279
information and but rant covers many

237
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:29,570
many many different topics so they do

238
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:31,839
have one called the defenders of the

239
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:36,620
lemma again talks about at a high level

240
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:38,959
what cyber security issues that cecil's

241
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:40,940
are worried about and some of the issues

242
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:45,170
that they have to somebody's that they

243
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:47,930
have to deal with okay now we into the

244
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:49,880
management stuff so compliance is a very

245
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:52,149
broad topic because of many many

246
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,709
different things to be compliant to

247
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:56,360
there to lists that I that I saw on the

248
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:59,779
internet that I kind of liked from from

249
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:02,600
Tilos and one from TDCI one in

250
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:04,430
particular that I've that I see a lot is

251
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,770
PCI DSS that's basically anything

252
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:08,149
involving a credit card and the credit

253
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:10,579
card people got together and said here's

254
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:12,580
a standard that we like all our anybody

255
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:17,180
who creates a credit card to follow and

256
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:18,920
they make it it's pretty extensive it's

257
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,469
pretty extensive but it could also be

258
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,300
interpreted in many different ways

259
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:26,089
GD P R which is privacy is a slightly

260
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:28,189
different thing is a European privacy

261
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:29,810
regulation that's a site where there's a

262
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:31,820
lot of information but the problem is

263
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:33,949
it's very because it's it's false

264
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,630
privacy it's a law it's very broad so I

265
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:38,570
don't know exactly where to look to look

266
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:40,400
for some of these things one thing that

267
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:44,630
you have to understand though is

268
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:47,600
compliance is is gives you a guideline

269
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:50,089
to keep you secure but because you're

270
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,390
compliant as I mean you're secure target

271
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:55,930
was PCI compliant and it still didn't it

272
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,930
still didn't help

273
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:03,339
this european union so one thing I

274
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,019
wonder about I don't know the answer

275
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:07,629
this question does account to does

276
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:09,579
Britain count brexit the brexit go

277
00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:12,339
soothed are they free are they you know

278
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:14,138
or do you not have to follow it now they

279
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:16,569
could say well if you have businesses in

280
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:18,850
the EU yes sell follow up and you

281
00:11:16,569 --> 00:11:20,498
businesses in the US have things in the

282
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:26,110
EU so they have to be aware of it to see

283
00:11:20,499 --> 00:11:29,199
how it affects your business yeah see

284
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:31,629
I'm so it so it's you know that's it's

285
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:33,389
just we know about it because they're

286
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:35,499
very they're very few organizations

287
00:11:33,389 --> 00:11:38,740
businesses that are limited to a single

288
00:11:35,499 --> 00:11:42,899
country and the many of them do some of

289
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:45,879
the EU and the consequences I that's why

290
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:47,499
being aware of it's good thing if you're

291
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:48,879
in an organization I hope that they're

292
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:50,980
aware of it and know how it affects your

293
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,589
organization directly and we also have

294
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:56,620
the CCPA which is the California version

295
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:59,050
of this and there are it's still this

296
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:01,689
they're still being amended even now so

297
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:03,699
I this is just a thing that I saw you

298
00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:06,399
know back in the 20th is still being

299
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:08,290
amended before before before to actually

300
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,829
say okay this is what the Privacy Act

301
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:15,370
says and related to privacy is an

302
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:16,779
organization called the IEP peed in or

303
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,610
egg the Association for privacy

304
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:20,860
professionals just some free material

305
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:23,620
they're free member the paid membership

306
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:25,329
is required for full access there it's

307
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:27,399
basically I'll talk to a little bit more

308
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:30,250
about that about the IEP a little later

309
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:36,149
but there's there is free material at

310
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:36,149
the IEP peep just not all of it and then

311
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,100
DHS has a Miss commencement premier for

312
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:44,079
CEOs Canada had a high enough level

313
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,759
there's a cybersecurity framework adness

314
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:50,800
which entails many of their different

315
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:52,600
documents and see a CMU the software

316
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,040
engineers to has a blog had a blog on

317
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,389
rich management that they risk

318
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,699
management endured that probably about a

319
00:12:55,389 --> 00:13:00,370
year ago so the risk is another very

320
00:12:57,699 --> 00:13:03,069
broad thing so something that helps me

321
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:05,889
to understand how security fits in a

322
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:09,339
business is I think of security as part

323
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:12,190
of risk because it's basically you

324
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:15,250
I have five bucks I need to protect

325
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:17,529
something what do I with my $5 what is

326
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,880
this thing I in my organization I should

327
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:20,890
protect what's the most important thing

328
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,930
is it intellectual property is it

329
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:25,600
people's data is it you know so I need

330
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:27,489
to make a decision I have to know what

331
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,520
risk I'm taking where I should put my

332
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:33,520
dollars to and knowing that it's risk

333
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:35,410
helps me understand what should I wear

334
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,640
should I be putting all my where should

335
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,469
I be putting my resources I can't

336
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,449
protect everything that's impossible

337
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:42,190
and I shouldn't spend two million

338
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:45,100
dollars to protect a million dollars

339
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:46,660
that's stupid so I need to understand

340
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,270
what I should be protecting in a

341
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:52,360
business and in an organization and that

342
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:55,750
goes with any organization training and

343
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:58,180
awareness this is more for maybe workers

344
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:01,480
who are looking to help their people

345
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:03,339
become aware of what is again free

346
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,660
resources of what they could videos they

347
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:09,790
could watch to see that discuss being

348
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:12,010
cyber aware just simple things about

349
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:18,010
being careful to don't click on certain

350
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:19,480
links things like that and they said

351
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:21,130
these are checklists these are just more

352
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,170
self-assessment things these again very

353
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:24,400
high level they can be very detailed so

354
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,660
they may depend on again your

355
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,610
organization or what it is you're trying

356
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,439
to protect but I found these that's okay

357
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:31,120
this may be may be useful to a few

358
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,230
people at least to have them have you

359
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,570
look at it and say okay here's the

360
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:37,360
things I need to keep in mind when I try

361
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:39,250
to assess myself but of course you need

362
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,190
to adapt it to your organization

363
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:44,380
okay the infrastructure this is the

364
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:46,089
infrastructure again is your network and

365
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,620
anything that you need in your

366
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:51,160
organization to get your work done a

367
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:54,490
great source is the Center for Internet

368
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:58,030
security their most famous product is

369
00:14:54,490 --> 00:15:00,610
the 20 controls the version 7.1 is their

370
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:03,880
latest version you do require signup in

371
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:05,380
order to download it Sands has posters

372
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,870
of the cia's controls of which are free

373
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:09,700
and they hit and they kind of link to

374
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:11,890
poke they kind of link the controls to

375
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,209
other external things that you can use

376
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:16,120
this to help you with this control and

377
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:19,000
so forth and then the other two are from

378
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:21,820
are to help you if you have a website if

379
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,150
you have your server-side your TLS how

380
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,400
to protect what you should do

381
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:28,220
to protect your website and they give

382
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:30,140
suggestions both of the the Ostia and

383
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:34,900
the mozilla server side give you suggest

384
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:36,980
to here though here the here the

385
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,459
encryption that you should use and so

386
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,960
forth

387
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,490
and they're very helpful because they

388
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,230
especially from Mozilla they say if you

389
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:44,960
have a new site here's what you use even

390
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:46,760
if you're talking to older computers is

391
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:50,050
what you use if you're just getting

392
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:52,730
started or you have a you know modern

393
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,990
site here's what you should use so they

394
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:56,210
give you some good suggestions

395
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:59,800
well-thought-out suggestions over how

396
00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:02,540
you should set up your your web server

397
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,099
better crypto used to be a PDF it's

398
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,849
basically not just a document on the

399
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,560
Internet

400
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:07,910
again written by a few people who are

401
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,920
concerned about crypto and they talk

402
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:13,250
about how to do crypto and using

403
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:16,130
different different front ends I'm sorry

404
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:19,550
using different backends nardac has a

405
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:21,410
free crypto tool for is that freely

406
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:22,760
download again it goes into the

407
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:24,920
different encryptions and things like

408
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:29,030
that and how you how you can set up your

409
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:33,410
own if you have your own website OpenSSH

410
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:35,030
is of is a secure shell that's openly

411
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:37,280
available to everybody because it's a

412
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:39,050
it's a free download and in mozilla can

413
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,660
gives recommendations over how best to

414
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:43,699
configure it so that it's so keep it as

415
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,550
secure as possible because they're

416
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,990
different many different encryption

417
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:49,849
algorithms some are better than others

418
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:52,340
some are more applicable than others and

419
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:54,260
mozilla gives suggestions on those and

420
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:58,730
the cloud security alliance gives a very

421
00:16:54,260 --> 00:17:01,069
thick document on security guidance for

422
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:07,010
the cloud in this version form so it's

423
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:08,930
the latest version they have all most of

424
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:12,109
this is free the csa else has the cloud

425
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:14,360
matrix to help you to ask questions and

426
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:16,550
they give you kind of a guidance related

427
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:17,240
to the document I saw that I just showed

428
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:20,359
you before

429
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:22,160
cyber kill chain I'm not completely well

430
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:25,060
versed in this but the cyber kill chain

431
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:28,100
is a way of seeing how tackers attack

432
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:30,200
websites and attack organizations and it

433
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:32,860
goes through a list of things that they

434
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:35,630
will do in an order in a certain order

435
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:37,139
Lockheed Martin has one mitre has one

436
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:40,740
and it basically

437
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:42,570
the the point is to understand different

438
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,940
ways attackers can get to you and if you

439
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:46,800
can get to get the attacker at this

440
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:49,500
point than anything over than anything

441
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,629
afterwards should be relatively dealt

442
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,160
with that's what the kill chain is and

443
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,570
if you want do you pentesting there's a

444
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,360
stiffness act there's an actual standard

445
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:59,129
out there that gives that gives again

446
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:04,500
guidelines on how to do a pen test how

447
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:06,600
best to do a pen testing incident

448
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,550
response and if an incident response is

449
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,500
basically what do I do when I get hacked

450
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:13,919
what do I do when something happens if

451
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:16,740
mice in my system and I found out that

452
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:21,350
some something's happened so these are

453
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:24,630
two again guidelines one from CMU and

454
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:26,790
both from CMU about creating a response

455
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:28,290
team is of several documents and videos

456
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:31,500
about that and there's a handbook that

457
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:32,730
was written a while ago but the concepts

458
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,630
of incident response haven't really

459
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:39,060
changed a whole lot and continuing

460
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:40,800
further crest is the British is a is a

461
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,659
British organization that also that does

462
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:45,810
that concern itself at cyber and there

463
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:48,330
is a PDF document for that and the DOJ

464
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:51,990
is it's a short document that basically

465
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:54,750
talks about if I'm a victim of an attack

466
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:56,730
or I've lost data what should I do next

467
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:59,190
it made it it discusses things of

468
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:01,860
concerning a law who do you you should

469
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:03,180
contact externally and in an

470
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:05,459
organization hopefully then you know

471
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,570
that already but if you've been

472
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:09,830
personally being attacked this is

473
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:09,830
something that might be useful to you

474
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:16,360
now in engineering this development

475
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,759
lifecycle is basically when you create

476
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:21,250
software you have a certain sequence of

477
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:22,899
things you have you have requirements

478
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:25,240
you have you have design you have

479
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:26,860
construction you have testing you have

480
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,720
deployment and you have maintenance and

481
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:31,389
it keeps going in a cycle around and

482
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,750
around and for so you can to do secure

483
00:19:31,389 --> 00:19:36,340
software the cycles basically is similar

484
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:41,889
but the security is not part it's not

485
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:46,059
part of the picture here are two models

486
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:49,120
of how to do software of how to do the

487
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:53,168
whole cycle open Sam is from Olas

488
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:55,779
building security in is is a document

489
00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:58,179
that talks about how companies practice

490
00:19:55,779 --> 00:20:00,159
it in cells here the practices that most

491
00:19:58,179 --> 00:20:02,529
companies seem to be doing it keeps

492
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:04,570
getting updated the version 9 is freely

493
00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:07,509
available version 10 which is recent

494
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:09,340
requires a sign up there's there can be

495
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:11,110
a mapping between the two but it's

496
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,789
basically better to choose one model and

497
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,139
stick with it but you can try to do a

498
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:17,830
map and I've never tried to do a mapping

499
00:20:14,139 --> 00:20:20,080
between the two microsoft also has their

500
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:21,580
own version of us of a lifecycle and

501
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,799
there's a free book that was published

502
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:25,600
in 2006 that they've made available over

503
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:28,840
the past couple years about Microsoft

504
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:32,289
security development life cycle see em I

505
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:34,860
see em USC I also did a capability

506
00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:38,529
maturity model is really really detailed

507
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:42,158
almost painfully detail and then rugged

508
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:46,389
is a site that talks about keeping about

509
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:49,690
just this s vs DLC but also just keeping

510
00:20:46,389 --> 00:20:53,080
a whole organization rugged in that it

511
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:56,470
can it can create software software

512
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:59,889
easily and some it led a little bit to a

513
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:03,940
dev set comps it's an early version of

514
00:20:59,889 --> 00:21:06,189
it training and some of this may be

515
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:09,190
applicable if you are at if you were at

516
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:11,980
gym Monaco's thing earlier today there

517
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:15,340
is the loss technic of tutorial series

518
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:17,440
safe code training two sets of slides

519
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:20,049
from open security training they have

520
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,700
these are slides for classes that these

521
00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:23,769
guys teach but they make the slides feel

522
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,340
available to you so these are things

523
00:21:23,769 --> 00:21:28,630
that you can

524
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:32,220
these look at for video or for slices to

525
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:36,309
get an idea of what's entailed in in

526
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:37,750
secure coding the secure coding says is

527
00:21:36,309 --> 00:21:38,639
another big topping and it depends on

528
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:41,080
yep

529
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:46,659
secure coding depends on on what

530
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:50,320
language you're using to so I lost tons

531
00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:52,299
of material on secure code I'm not even

532
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,799
gonna go to what they had there's just

533
00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:55,990
so much out there I'm pointing to the

534
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:57,730
different projects and endear a bunch of

535
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:59,970
cheap there's also OS cheat sheets that

536
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:05,080
also talks a lot about these things and

537
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:06,730
mitre talks mitre corporation sponsors

538
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,199
two sites one called the weakness

539
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:09,970
enumeration and the other called

540
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,039
vulnerabilities and exposures and I just

541
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:13,720
had to add some Jeff earlier today about

542
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:16,919
the difference between a two a week this

543
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:20,320
is something like cross-site scripting

544
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:23,289
that's a weakness a vulnerability would

545
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,360
be version X of Windows with running

546
00:22:23,289 --> 00:22:26,559
this version of Mozilla will have this

547
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,250
will have this cross site scripting

548
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,250
problem

549
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:34,809
so vulnerabilities and exposures are

550
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:38,679
would be specific to products weaknesses

551
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:40,960
are more or more general but mitre

552
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:45,220
corporation sponsors both sponsors both

553
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:47,470
of them there are other sources I just

554
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:49,480
give you a few here I Triple E has a

555
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:53,380
design document called avoiding the top

556
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:55,899
ten security flaws it's basically a in

557
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:57,760
text it doesn't give you specific things

558
00:22:55,899 --> 00:22:59,678
for language it gives you a whole more

559
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,908
of a design here's how you design a type

560
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,549
see here the things to keep in mind when

561
00:23:00,909 --> 00:23:06,640
you design it sans has a SWOT checklist

562
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:08,408
which is which which can break break

563
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,279
down things into smaller pieces as you

564
00:23:08,409 --> 00:23:14,770
as you go down their checklist and again

565
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:16,960
the sei has top ten secure coding

566
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:19,059
practices similar to this one except

567
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,380
again it's in its in text doesn't it's

568
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:22,379
not it's language independent

569
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:30,020
cwe Sands has the top 25 most dangerous

570
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:32,970
software errors in some detail

571
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:34,770
SMU the CI search secure coding

572
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:39,270
standards they have they have an active

573
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:40,920
JIRA page that talks about that they

574
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:43,740
keep updating aging and your YouTube

575
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:52,140
that talks about secure coding for C C++

576
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:54,240
Java Perl and they say Android 4 they

577
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,920
have different they have guidelines and

578
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,210
recommendations on secure coding and

579
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:00,270
those in those languages at the site

580
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:02,190
Mozilla has secure coding guidelines for

581
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:04,350
web and Microsoft has secure coding

582
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,580
guidelines for dotnet so there are many

583
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:10,050
different standards that are out there

584
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:12,809
concerning concerning coding and a lot

585
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:15,510
of I'm sure your company is out there

586
00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:18,120
with their static tool analysis take

587
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:22,550
some of these and make and automated

588
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:24,928
automated for you and as another

589
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:26,550
organization is to for securing open

590
00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:29,040
methodologies they have a secure a

591
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:32,580
security testing manual it's kind of

592
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:34,379
like similar to the Olas one same same

593
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:36,530
concept just it's their own version of

594
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,530
it

595
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:44,320
okay general subjects these are more

596
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:46,209
these are broader not necessarily all

597
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,908
security related but some of them are

598
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:51,970
Ross Anderson is a professor it I think

599
00:24:48,909 --> 00:24:53,770
at Oxford he has a book called security

600
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:56,140
engineering in the second edition this

601
00:24:53,770 --> 00:25:00,340
2008 he's currently working on the third

602
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:02,020
edition and it is 900 pages but it's an

603
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:04,360
overview because he talks about many

604
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:07,418
different aspects of security of which

605
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:09,039
many are not software related but it's a

606
00:25:07,419 --> 00:25:10,539
good it's it's a good overview because

607
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,908
he talks about all these different

608
00:25:10,539 --> 00:25:15,250
issues like tamper proof things like

609
00:25:12,909 --> 00:25:18,190
that even biometrics all these different

610
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:20,620
all these different topics that are

611
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:24,460
about security Peter Goodman from New

612
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:25,870
Zealand has a technical document of that

613
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:28,539
that's interact that was in draft form

614
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:31,120
in 2014 about also been engineering

615
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:33,250
security but he's more he's more down in

616
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,840
the weeds maybe more infrastructure

617
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:38,470
oriented like your network and things

618
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:40,330
like that the third document underneath

619
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:42,549
is called thus known as a suite Bach the

620
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:43,928
software body engineering of software

621
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:46,510
engineering body of knowledge it is not

622
00:25:43,929 --> 00:25:49,360
a security document but is also it's

623
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:52,270
also standard one nine seven five nine

624
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:55,629
it was an attempt it's an attempt to try

625
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:59,559
to summarize software engineering into a

626
00:25:55,630 --> 00:26:02,500
single document some would say it's very

627
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:03,940
waterfall related but some would also

628
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:07,179
try to say that at least you can try to

629
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:09,640
these squeezed out squeeze out concepts

630
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:11,440
in agile to but it is available and it

631
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:13,000
happens to be I did not know this until

632
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,890
recently lost footings together that

633
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,890
it's that's also an ISO standard

634
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:26,350
Charles cause Yurok wrote a book called

635
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:28,030
the tcp/ip guide it was done by no

636
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:30,399
starch press is published by no starch

637
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:32,110
press but he kept updating it and he

638
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,240
does have it made it available for free

639
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:37,510
on the internet so when I have questions

640
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,820
on tcp/ip I actually go there and look

641
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:41,020
them and look him up he and he tries to

642
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:43,419
be especially if I don't understand

643
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:45,790
things in the networking he has these

644
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:47,620
reasonable explanations for it and it's

645
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:50,940
pretty it's pretty extensive you were to

646
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:55,540
print it out it'd be ridiculously thick

647
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:58,120
the the second link about a pam book of

648
00:26:55,540 --> 00:27:00,520
applied to cryptography by crc is very

649
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:03,219
very very very very math oriented i

650
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:04,690
don't even understand it i look at it

651
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:06,370
and they're symbols of symbols and

652
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:07,809
symbols and full of symbols and i just i

653
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:10,030
put it there in case you're

654
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:12,760
mathematically inclined and wanted i

655
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:15,129
want to try to tackle it the Mel and

656
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:17,350
Baker one helped me a lot when I was

657
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:18,970
studying for the CISSP test it helped me

658
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:21,428
understand the concepts of cryptography

659
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:23,230
and I used I found for me it was very

660
00:27:21,429 --> 00:27:26,470
very useful so I put it there because I

661
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:28,240
found it I found it very useful it was

662
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:30,880
much more much simpler than reading this

663
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:34,270
this one I couldn't even comprehend but

664
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:37,600
it is free and it is out there the rest

665
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:40,480
of these are taxonomies on software

666
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:43,899
errors security risk incident

667
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:46,000
classifications because and I think

668
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:48,370
keeping things organized is very helpful

669
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,140
the it just keeps skips key keeps things

670
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:51,580
from getting too messy and to getting

671
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:54,340
too chaotic so these are just different

672
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:57,270
ways of organizing different things that

673
00:27:54,340 --> 00:28:01,230
are that that have been made available

674
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:04,020
and my last missed my last missed

675
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:07,420
reference there have a glossary of terms

676
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:10,900
that's online for version 3 and version

677
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:13,720
2 has is is available but it's

678
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:17,010
considered withdrawn but they have terms

679
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:19,300
they're on anything on on any term on on

680
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:22,020
cyber that you did you could possibly

681
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,020
want to ask for

682
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:27,450

683
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:31,049

691
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:51,330
