1
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,740
my name is John I will be and my wife

2
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:27,660
should take the hat off of the

3
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,549
presentation so I am take now I

4
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,750
originally had my Yankee hat on she's

5
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,300
like you don't want people hating you

6
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,640
before you even start speaking but so

7
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,440
any Dodger fans out there truly

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,210
heartbroken for you because I wanted

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,410
Yankees versus Dodgers World Series I

10
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,970
thought that would be awesome but now we

11
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,989
have to get past and everyone has their

12
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:51,300
problems right so I'll leave this slide

13
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:53,309
up there for a second if you want to try

14
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,849
to go grab the slide if you want to

15
00:00:53,309 --> 00:01:01,500
download them I think that's gonna still

16
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:03,090
rotate through anyway but if anyone is

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,380
successful in downloading those let me

18
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:17,369
know it's gonna go there in a second I

19
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:18,030
was but anyway you know just stay there

20
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,190
John

21
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,960
I would so you know how long it took me

22
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,910
to get the that slideshow thing to work

23
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,119
last night it should have done more it

24
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:30,119
should have done more time so let's see

25
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,700
we're here to talk about how to get into

26
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,830
the cyber security career how many

27
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,140
people are actually working in some sort

28
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,500
of cyber security job right now all

29
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,450
right

30
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,450
a few of you how many people are in some

31
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,280
type of technical field is there anyone

32
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,890
who's at a non technical field but still

33
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,640
wants to get over into there okay there

34
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:52,020
is hope there leave no no there is

35
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,640
definitely hope for you so good I'm glad

36
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,310
we've got one got one of my students in

37
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,580
here you awesome Anna hi Anna

38
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,959
oh I'm sorry I did you Rex I apologize

39
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,429
they did not see you there so I got two

40
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:07,410
awesome suits just about to say my best

41
00:02:02,429 --> 00:02:09,929
student but now awkward so let's just

42
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:11,760
get right into this presentation we're a

43
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:15,000
nice small intimate group freezing

44
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,220
together so we can you know just shout

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,959
out if you have any questions as we go

46
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,709
along we will power this out so

47
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,140
originally I've been doing this

48
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:27,540
presentation a few times I think first

49
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,239
they did it for my employer Boeing and

50
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:33,209
then I did it for shell con last year

51
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,550
done it at layer 1 I've done it some

52
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:38,610
community colleges so this has become

53
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:41,220
my thing too when I became a community

54
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,960
college teacher I didn't expect I would

55
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,330
have such an effect on helping people

56
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,700
get jobs and it's really been exciting

57
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,770
to help people write letters

58
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,320
recommendation connecting the recruiters

59
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,820
see them you know advance Malia if you

60
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,890
haven't met Malia walking around here

61
00:02:53,820 --> 00:03:00,510
she is just been the poster child of

62
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:02,160
success in the cyber security field so

63
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,250
let's go and talk about know hey let's

64
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,650
talk about me uh so I like to let you

65
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,060
know like the important thing so

66
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,410
amazingly my wife was reviewing much

67
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,210
like she goes why I'm in there I'm like

68
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:15,690
how else am I gonna prove that I am

69
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:20,100
actually married so I was in the Navy 28

70
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:22,170
years any veterans know better okay ah

71
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,090
big Star Trek fan so I had my picture

72
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:26,519
taken with William Shatner a few years

73
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,410
ago that is actually on my profile at

74
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,540
work and so when I come up people are

75
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:31,920
like ooh picturing your email that your

76
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,450
dad for like the picture so small they

77
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,850
can't tell like that's my friend bill

78
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,320
and then this isn't me and one of the

79
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,820
Comic Cons and I say I had my picture

80
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,019
taken with Slimer because I wanted to be

81
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,720
in a picture with someone whose teeth

82
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:45,090
were actually worse than mine so you

83
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,650
know I've been doing started off a

84
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,480
software developer a million years ago

85
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:51,510
assisted ministration finally became a

86
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,450
security guy bunch of certifications

87
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:56,040
we'll talk about that later I teach at

88
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:59,070
Long Beach City College that's where Rex

89
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,720
and Ana know me from and because I have

90
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,609
an addiction to education I'm actually

91
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:07,320
going for a master's degree right now

92
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:09,330
with with fans so here's a list of our

93
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,680
topics that we'll be talking about so

94
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,480
let's start off with some definitions

95
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,980
right because everybody thinks we know

96
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,349
what something means and then we kind of

97
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:18,269
have a different definition there's two

98
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,190
definitions of cyber cure cybersecurity

99
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:21,750
that I picked out but I'd like to bet

100
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:24,180
the bottom one for what we're talking

101
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,100
about here measures taken to protect a

102
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,350
computer or computer system against

103
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,330
unauthorized access or attack because

104
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:32,400
that's like the basic nugget of it right

105
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,770
cybersecurity and it's been a lot of

106
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,210
different terms over the years of back

107
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,440
in the day it start off with computer

108
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,750
security and then they had to abbreviate

109
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,640
so it's compact then it became

110
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,740
information security because well it's

111
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,180
not so much the computer as it is the

112
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,460
information on it that we really care

113
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,169
about right the laptop gets stolen well

114
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,758
that thing but we

115
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:53,188
go out and buy another laptop if we've

116
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:54,659
got our photos on there or important

117
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:56,789
documents and we haven't been backing

118
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:57,900
them up then then it's that information

119
00:04:56,789 --> 00:04:59,400
that we really care about

120
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,039
then it became information assurance

121
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,109
right because it's not just the you know

122
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:05,729
the security of it it's like all the

123
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,469
different protections of it and then

124
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:09,090
someone said that's kind of an old term

125
00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:10,949
now we need to go to cyber security so

126
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,400
if you want to get funding for anything

127
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:12,779
today

128
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,279
quick cyber in it right that's the

129
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:15,509
that's the current sexy word I don't

130
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:16,740
know what they're gonna come up with

131
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:21,870
next I'm sure they'll figure something

132
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:24,120
out but so pivoting so this is the first

133
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:28,560
time I've used the term pivot to define

134
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,990
this talk but I am gonna talk out the

135
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,460
definition and I have a reason for

136
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:35,039
pivoting is the exclusive method of

137
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,539
using an instance also known by foothold

138
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,029
to be able to move from place to place

139
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:40,949
inside the compromised network it uses

140
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:43,589
the first compromised system foothold to

141
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:45,870
allow you us to compromise other devices

142
00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:48,810
and servers that are otherwise

143
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:50,580
inaccessible directly so now in hacking

144
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,560
we talk about pivoting right you get

145
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,419
into that first machine maybe they love

146
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,669
to guess account open there's just some

147
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:58,979
easy way in but now we want to go out

148
00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:01,680
and find from this machine where can we

149
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:04,889
go where can we pivot to I want you to

150
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,930
think of yourselves as having a foothold

151
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:08,789
in some career you several you're

152
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:11,909
already working in cyber security or

153
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:14,159
some other technical field you're

154
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:16,889
already an insider how do you pivot to

155
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:20,430
there ah in your case how do you pivot

156
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:22,229
out of your what your background is to

157
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,759
something else or you know how do you

158
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:26,729
like what are the applicant

159
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,469
applicability of what I do to cyber and

160
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:29,878
there is I'm certain or something out

161
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:32,729
there so we'll talk about the word

162
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:35,819
pivoting again later so first is there a

163
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:38,128
demand for cyber security yeah we know

164
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:40,649
there is that's why we're all here I'm

165
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:45,120
just fortunate that so at one point in

166
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:48,689
the Navy in late 90s I was tasked to do

167
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:53,580
a analyst not use that word

168
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:57,419
an analysis of software content

169
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:58,979
filtering and an AV tools and really

170
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:00,539
stuff that's like really boring and

171
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:03,120
benign today but back then it was kind

172
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:04,560
of new so I

173
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,480
you'll find if this presentation has a

174
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,520
lot of links because I want this to be

175
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,870
reference material for you I want you to

176
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,070
be able to take this presentation not

177
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:13,229
just have some pictures and talking

178
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:17,010
point but link that you can go to for

179
00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:19,110
further information so I put a article

180
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:21,150
in there that talks about though you

181
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,330
know one of the many studies that have

182
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:25,888
out there on the gap in cyber security

183
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:28,320
professional one of the terms I love

184
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:30,270
here is closing the gap with new collar

185
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,790
right we've heard of blue collar and and

186
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:35,099
you know white collar workers new collar

187
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:36,900
workers is saying take your existing

188
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,970
workforce the people already at your

189
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,950
company and train them to do the cyber

190
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:43,500
jobs they already understand the company

191
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:45,150
area understand what you do just put a

192
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,760
cyber component to it so I really like

193
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:52,340
that one and then just a couple of other

194
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:54,750
articles on on defining the cyber field

195
00:07:52,340 --> 00:08:00,119
this one's kind of cool because it shows

196
00:07:54,750 --> 00:08:01,889
a top ten top ten high pays highest

197
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,889
paying cyber security jobs and

198
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:06,449
penetration tester is like around number

199
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:07,830
five I think pen tester is like the one

200
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:09,630
that people always gravitate to right

201
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,580
because that's the one that's mr. robot

202
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:13,200
right that's the real sexy one there are

203
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:15,210
a lot of other things out there to do

204
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:19,620
right but for pen tester number five on

205
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:22,289
there and just want to try to give you

206
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,120
more of an idea that there are so many

207
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:26,099
things out there right so just don't

208
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:29,610
think about the guy on a box banging

209
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:46,140
away there are people who analyze a

210
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:47,070
threat question oh I apologize I didn't

211
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:56,370
know people were having trouble seeing

212
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:58,709
it okay yay all right brief commercial

213
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:00,420
interruption so for event example you

214
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:02,609
know they talk about advanced persistent

215
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:05,130
threats there are people whose job are

216
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:07,110
to be threat analysts to look and see

217
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,209
what's coming next what does the company

218
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,709
need to defend themselves against

219
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:13,650
application security any any developers

220
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:16,589
web developers other programmers huge

221
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:19,770
huge field applications security right

222
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:21,180
um I should I put Anna on the spot Anna

223
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:26,280
where do I say most vulnerable ities

224
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:29,430
come from okay and I just broke my heart

225
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:31,939
Rach you want to give it a try day one

226
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:35,699
what do I say

227
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,600
crappy software right bad software is

228
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,270
where it's all coming from

229
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:43,230
so people wrote the software sure half

230
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:46,230
point for X on that one but getting

231
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:48,000
developers to understand here's all the

232
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:49,440
things that you need to look for when

233
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,870
you're developing the software right you

234
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,190
don't go and if your building is

235
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:55,400
completely done is not the time to go

236
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:57,630
make sure you have a solid foundation

237
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,939
you know of course the cloud that's a

238
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:02,689
big one out there but risk management

239
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:05,400
governance just the compliance aspect

240
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:07,650
not necessarily tactical but really

241
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:10,829
important to the cybersecurity field and

242
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:14,579
I listed out from needs website flow I

243
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:16,560
came up with a bunch of different career

244
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,550
field so a lot of them got security in

245
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,410
there but then we talked about our

246
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,420
friend penetration tester forensic

247
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,490
examiner forensics is another one that's

248
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:27,660
really interesting if you are good at

249
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:30,240
math go look into cryptography right cuz

250
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,740
um should I put you on the spot again

251
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,130
what do I say about cryptography

252
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:38,190
cryptography is hard that is why it is

253
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:40,620
done improperly all the time and so if

254
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:43,020
you have a acumen for that oh definitely

255
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,040
focus yourself on that but then you know

256
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:47,660
there's people who have to do the

257
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:50,849
management of it sale quality turn of

258
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:53,430
insurance there are starting to offer of

259
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:55,110
cybersecurity insurance to companies

260
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:57,479
right how much money are you going to

261
00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:00,240
lose during a some type of hack against

262
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,700
your company and in order to give also

263
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,070
we on most of us probably pay for car

264
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:07,620
insurance right thank you if you're

265
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:09,600
gonna get the doors so we pay for car

266
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,490
insurance and what goes into the cost of

267
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,500
our car insurance what kind of car we

268
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:15,180
drive how long we've been driving watch

269
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,860
our record where do we live where do we

270
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,630
park that car at night if you're going

271
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,490
to give insurance through someone for

272
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:23,070
cyber security you're gonna have to ask

273
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:25,440
question what is your cyber hygiene how

274
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:28,140
well are you taking care of your network

275
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,390
if you we go out and find out you're

276
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:32,189
running Windows XP

277
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,600
not gonna want to insure you but if

278
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,880
you're running latest version of Windows

279
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,730
and you have a regular patch updates

280
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,710
going you're showing you're doing your

281
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:42,840
effort to keep yourself secure you're

282
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:45,570
training your people on how to look for

283
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,280
a phishing attempt so uh you know

284
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:49,470
insurance if someone's working an

285
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,900
insurance company that could be a new

286
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:55,830
field come on in

287
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:57,900
so again some website website and what I

288
00:11:55,830 --> 00:12:02,040
want to point out is I have a couple in

289
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:03,959
there for non-technical people so you

290
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,459
know there is a need it doesn't just

291
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,410
have to be the cyber geeks of the people

292
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:11,820
who know how to take a computer apart to

293
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:13,020
do these jobs alright so I'm not gonna

294
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:16,170
embarrass myself any more by putting

295
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:18,510
Anna and Rex on the spot but so this is

296
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:20,699
from one of our classes right this is

297
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:22,110
one of the slides are using class I do

298
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,060
reference a book down there because as

299
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:27,590
one of my teacher said a properly I know

300
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:32,280
to properly annotated footnote turned

301
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:33,450
plagiarism into research so do not go

302
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,040
buy this book because I put it on the

303
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:36,600
slide I know someone did it but I really

304
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,339
should talk to me for starters you get

305
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,460
that you can get that book for free on

306
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:43,080
the Long Beach Public Library website

307
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:46,170
and probably a lot of other public

308
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:48,600
library websites the other thing is it

309
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:51,240
okay for a class it's not a great

310
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:54,630
reference book but what I want to point

311
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:57,270
out here is when you look at what I want

312
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:59,250
to do in cybersecurity keep these three

313
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:00,930
areas of mine so technical is the one

314
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,730
that we always gravitate you that's the

315
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,959
blinking light that's the boxes that's

316
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:07,290
the stuff that people try to sell you

317
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:11,840
here make your network secure but

318
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:14,280
administrative of training policy

319
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:17,760
governance those are important and

320
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:19,740
physical control right uh how are we

321
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,290
protecting our computer assets because

322
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,090
if the bad guy can walk in and pull out

323
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:26,969
a hard drive onto your server and walk

324
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:28,530
out with it then all your technical

325
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:31,890
controls don't really matter anymore

326
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:33,270
right except one wreck Anna what's the

327
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,770
laughs what's the left path you know

328
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:38,250
protection if someone gets a hold of our

329
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:40,460
computer pull this encryption yay full

330
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:44,410
points the wrecks on that one

331
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:46,199
so you know keep in mind on

332
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:48,819
stuff that you have a background in

333
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:51,819
maybe you were in construction for

334
00:13:48,819 --> 00:13:54,370
example there are areas that just

335
00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:56,319
involve building out secure spaces to

336
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:58,269
meet certain government requirements

337
00:13:56,319 --> 00:14:00,219
right so that's why we have a

338
00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:02,889
lock-picking village here that could be

339
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:05,139
part of your pen testing to go and

340
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:07,389
demonstrate Hey look yeah you've got a

341
00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:09,610
great firewall and all that but you're

342
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:12,339
locked or total cheese with and I can

343
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:14,050
get to your servers anyway so I put this

344
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:17,439
slide up again to show you that there

345
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:18,939
are different areas to be in I point out

346
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:20,379
you may already be involved in cyber

347
00:14:18,939 --> 00:14:22,420
security a bunch of you raised your hand

348
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:24,100
said you were but if you thought you

349
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:27,339
weren't look at some of the things you

350
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:29,560
could be doing um you know I talked to

351
00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:32,500
earlier I called the crappy software but

352
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:35,170
poorly implemented software systems not

353
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,360
being administered correctly uh just

354
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:39,339
basic design problems meltdown inspector

355
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,160
right that wasn't software that was just

356
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:44,649
a design not just but a design issue I

357
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,810
use the term cyber hygiene I didn't coin

358
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:49,600
it but I do like that term right just

359
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:51,880
like go and wash our hands in there are

360
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,870
we doing things on a regular basis to

361
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:57,430
keep our system secure all right so

362
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,209
let's get to the point the things that

363
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:01,149
you're probably going to be interested

364
00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:04,089
about what kind of training can you do

365
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:09,550
to enhance your career or move more into

366
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:11,649
a cybersecurity career so a lot of jobs

367
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:13,719
today still require four-year degrees

368
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:15,670
right you go look at the job things it's

369
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,189
not necessarily relevant to what you do

370
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:19,540
but they especially big companies still

371
00:15:18,189 --> 00:15:21,610
have that four-year degree

372
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:25,029
bias although I'm sorry to see a little

373
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:26,470
bit of a wind of change in that but it

374
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:28,509
doesn't mean that you need a four-year

375
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:30,939
degree to be have a career in cyber

376
00:15:28,509 --> 00:15:33,149
security and if you already had a degree

377
00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:36,040
and let's say it wasn't relevant

378
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:37,360
directly relevant maybe you had you know

379
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,920
some type of little large degree or

380
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,170
business degree and you want to get more

381
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,969
to the technical side on that I'm going

382
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:47,290
to state that getting another four-year

383
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:50,980
degree isn't necessarily the way you you

384
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:53,319
want to go so one of the links I have in

385
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,880
here is this about a 15 minute long

386
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:55,810
video it's called success in a new

387
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,130
economy and it

388
00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:00,400
really interesting because they talked

389
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:01,900
about you know I think at one point the

390
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,699
trades were getting a bad rep you know

391
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,900
like people going and being plumbers

392
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,820
electricians you know all you're not

393
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:09,939
gonna make as much money as a person who

394
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:11,350
has a four-year degree and uh you know

395
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:14,050
it's not necessarily true cuz they talk

396
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:16,300
about well look at the career path of a

397
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:17,560
successful plumber and maybe a person

398
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:21,910
who's in the business field but not

399
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:24,459
doing all that stellar so that that

400
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:26,920
video is really interesting then I go on

401
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:29,589
to point out that in Southern California

402
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:32,110
there are several schools that have the

403
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:35,620
NFA endorsement for senators for

404
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:37,330
academic excellence the three community

405
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,640
colleges are coastline Cypress and Long

406
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:42,400
Beach and I even though I teach at Long

407
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,900
Beach I was still I lifted them in the

408
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,970
order that the school's received their

409
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:48,760
their accreditation for that

410
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:51,070
there's also another College Community

411
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:53,050
College in Northern California if you

412
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:58,690
are looking for four-year degree

413
00:16:53,050 --> 00:17:00,550
Cal Poly Pomona CSU San Bernardino UCI

414
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:02,470
and now the most recent one is Webster

415
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:04,329
University which I haven't even heard of

416
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:06,429
until recently they're down in Irvine a

417
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:07,810
private university they just received

418
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:09,550
their four-year endorsement for their

419
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:12,310
bachelor's degree and they also have a

420
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:14,169
master's degree in cyber security and

421
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:17,230
then we're going to talk a lot more

422
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:20,020
about certifications but I also want to

423
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:21,870
point out that in addition to agreed

424
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:25,240
there are certain positions that want

425
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:29,379
specific cybersecurity certifications

426
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:31,540
and having no CFIT fee is one of the big

427
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,670
ones that you'll see in there but like

428
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,720
the DoD really is a driver for that so

429
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:37,150
if you're trying to work for any of the

430
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,810
big aerospace companies you know the

431
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:42,240
Boeing's who's left North row but with

432
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:45,730
all the mergers their most amor got

433
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:49,600
Aerospace Corporation but gray Theon

434
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:53,410
yeah thank you but you know used to be

435
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:55,629
so many more but the the DoD requirement

436
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:58,060
for certifications has been flowed down

437
00:17:55,630 --> 00:18:00,700
to the contractor but the bullet here I

438
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:02,460
like you know that this I believe that

439
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:05,380
technical training and certifications

440
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:07,630
can get you into this no faster than

441
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,549
another four-year degree in fact to

442
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:11,470
emphasize that point

443
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:13,658
we have a student from Cal State Long

444
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:16,509
Beach going for a four-year degree she

445
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:18,610
is at the cheese became a part of the

446
00:18:16,509 --> 00:18:20,139
Long Beach City cybersecurity Club

447
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:22,418
because she said they just wasn't enough

448
00:18:20,139 --> 00:18:22,928
time security training in their program

449
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:30,789
right

450
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:32,769
so yes okay so the question is on

451
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:33,970
certifications anyone ever done to come

452
00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:46,210
to you a certification recently they

453
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:48,340
could shout out a price but okay well

454
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:50,499
but I'm gonna talk to that a little so

455
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:52,029
it's a good question on how much they

456
00:18:50,499 --> 00:18:53,769
could caught on how much these

457
00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:56,259
certifications caught still cheaper than

458
00:18:53,769 --> 00:19:02,980
a four-year degree right even at like

459
00:18:56,259 --> 00:19:05,769
your lowest price University what the

460
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:08,619
quality you're getting here so so what

461
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:10,330
are you talking about cuz we are really

462
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:11,980
going to talk about that so there are no

463
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:13,480
veterans in the room other than me so I

464
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:15,220
will skip this life you know any

465
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,139
veterans though please send them this

466
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,879
information and for those of you who are

467
00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:20,918
taking pictures if you walked a little

468
00:19:18,879 --> 00:19:24,488
late I will show again at the end where

469
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:27,340
you can download these slides so on to

470
00:19:24,489 --> 00:19:31,239
cyber security certification so there

471
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:34,509
are two rather polarized schools of

472
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:35,590
thought in certification right I don't

473
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:37,029
know if I'm getting a laugh back there

474
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:38,980
because the person knows where I'm going

475
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:40,749
with this but so there are people go

476
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:42,399
okay so there are people like me who

477
00:19:40,749 --> 00:19:44,440
just get certification have no idea what

478
00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:46,059
they're talking about no there are

479
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,529
people who just they collect them right

480
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,999
they just keep on getting certification

481
00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:51,309
now one of the reasons I get so many

482
00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:53,889
certifications is because I teach and it

483
00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:55,119
helped me with my teaching then there

484
00:19:53,889 --> 00:19:57,519
are people on the other hand who's like

485
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:59,949
they have been taking computers apart

486
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:01,570
since infancy they know this stuff

487
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,470
backwards and forwards they're great and

488
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:04,149
they're like I don't need a

489
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:07,509
certification to prove I know what I'm

490
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:10,209
doing right but the very simple fact is

491
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:12,759
if you went to a doctor's office and you

492
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:14,739
said the doctor hey um I don't see a

493
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:16,830
degree on the wall and I'm like I didn't

494
00:20:14,739 --> 00:20:19,779
actually go to medical school you know

495
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:22,059
but you know what I did say the Holiday

496
00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:23,230
Inn Express last night and you know I

497
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:25,000
watch a lot of ER

498
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:27,669
I know what I'm doing right you want you

499
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,590
you want some level of confidence that

500
00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:33,460
the person had a good day and passed the

501
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:35,490
test right so again you could just go in

502
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:38,080
and do a come to you and you crammed and

503
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:39,250
you passed the exam and you dumped all

504
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,428
that knowledge you know that right

505
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:44,230
doesn't mean that you are that you

506
00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:45,790
it doesn't really prove that you're

507
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:47,429
qualified wouldn't prove that you at

508
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:49,570
least went and educated yourself in and

509
00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:51,850
demonstrate some effort and as I said

510
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:55,418
there are some places that legally have

511
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:57,580
to have these certification and as

512
00:20:55,419 --> 00:20:59,290
further proof of that go on to the

513
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:01,360
different job website so I have dice

514
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:05,320
indeed monitor there any other job site

515
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:09,639
people are using I left out I gave up on

516
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:10,870
on cyber coders link they okay yeah you

517
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,190
know I forget that LinkedIn has their

518
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,899
own job search yeah so that would've

519
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:15,700
been a good one to put in there but go

520
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:18,160
search for Joe you know look at the jobs

521
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,360
you know so you go and you find a job

522
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,040
you're interested and see if they list

523
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,059
any certification then take some of

524
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,290
those certifications we're gonna be

525
00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:24,850
talking about on the subsequent slide

526
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:27,668
and search for them you'll see which

527
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:29,860
kind of jobs are coming up alright so

528
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:32,140
this is going back to where I talked

529
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:35,049
about where I said the DoD and all the

530
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:38,500
big aerospace defense contractors have

531
00:21:35,049 --> 00:21:40,120
this this requirement that you follow so

532
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,200
this is intentionally an eye chart down

533
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,149
here I didn't expect you to be able to

534
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,380
read it but if you go to the link it

535
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:46,990
will show you that full chart and

536
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:48,850
basically what this is saying for some

537
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:50,890
of you know if you're an auditor here's

538
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:52,540
the certification up to if your

539
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:56,470
management you're the certification and

540
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:59,440
from left is like a lower level and to

541
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:01,540
the right more senior so like CSS P is

542
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,890
the top right box right so I always say

543
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:05,020
if you're Hollywood Squares you know I'm

544
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:07,030
up in the net in that corner right about

545
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:09,250
Paul Lynn probably know when this room

546
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:12,129
has ever heard the call when uh look you

547
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:15,429
know the Weird Al song here okay yeah I

548
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:16,960
think he did so you can never go wrong

549
00:22:15,429 --> 00:22:20,620
with a weird I'll reference in this

550
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,030
crowd right so so if you're looking for

551
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:23,889
if you're either working for any of the

552
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:25,780
big contractors or you're maybe thinking

553
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:27,640
about getting into them this would be a

554
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:29,440
good link to follow and go read up about

555
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:33,130
this because they have to meet those

556
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,799
requirements county up Rex on to your

557
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:36,640
question so anyone have the security

558
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:38,610
plus

559
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,540
if you've got one person and Security+

560
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:41,770
so these are some of their

561
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,720
certifications now they have some new

562
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:44,920
one they have the cyber security analyst

563
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,250
right because they want to get into the

564
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:51,630
game and have have a you know cyber

565
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:53,590
cyber specific one advanced security

566
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:56,470
practitioner they also have a pen test

567
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:59,590
one but then some more generic Linux and

568
00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:01,870
cloud I have two links in there one is

569
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:06,070
the CompTIA site itself and talked about

570
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:08,860
their certification the other one is an

571
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:11,649
article that basically went through and

572
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:13,360
written and divide them between here's

573
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:15,640
their basic wand tiers or ones that are

574
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,990
more specific to certain careers but

575
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,820
then I've got a big bullet down there

576
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,230
that you could get these certifications

577
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:22,149
that will cross through your friendly

578
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:24,250
community colleges because some of the

579
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:27,309
certifications the colleges actually

580
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:31,480
have searched and now I'm using the word

581
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:33,399
certain a different way to pay for the

582
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,780
for you to take the certification event

583
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,600
so you go take a fairly inexpensive

584
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:41,110
course at a community college to help

585
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:43,330
you prepare for it and then the school

586
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:46,479
may be able to help you with the cost of

587
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:47,918
certification exam as opposed to when

588
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:55,510
you did your security plus did you take

589
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:58,660
training course through them okay all

590
00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:00,340
right so because there are specific prep

591
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:02,799
courses for them and they are not

592
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:04,928
inexpensive they're probably in like you

593
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:08,770
know the $1,200 range a thousand dollar

594
00:24:04,929 --> 00:24:11,140
range for for those so I am I am always

595
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:12,580
trying to steer people towards low-cost

596
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,900
solutions and my students know and what

597
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:18,879
we trying to get them free stuff right

598
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:20,290
we all love free so that's CompTIA now

599
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,950
you said your IDF cf-52

600
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:26,530
awesome okay so the CSS fee is the one

601
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:28,570
that really still have a lot of clout

602
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:30,870
that people look for although a little a

603
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:32,860
little bit of sign of cracks on there

604
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:34,059
but the funny thing is I'll have a

605
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,168
student come in you know and they're

606
00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:36,309
like fresh out of high school or

607
00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:37,750
something like I wanna get my CSS

608
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:38,980
because all these jobs want it well at

609
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:41,440
least they're doing some research but

610
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,730
CSP is really the one that you've got to

611
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,809
be in the industry for a few years

612
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:48,040
before you can get it so typically you

613
00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:49,809
need five years of experience to get

614
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,590
your CSS P if you have a four year dot

615
00:24:49,809 --> 00:24:52,539
college

616
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:55,418
agree they'll take one year off but now

617
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:58,090
to further you know make it more

618
00:24:55,419 --> 00:25:00,159
available to people they have their CIFS

619
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:03,100
a the a being associated instead of

620
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:05,260
professional and you can get you can

621
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:07,270
pass the exam say I'm a CSS a and then

622
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:08,679
try to get a job to help you get the

623
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:13,629
relevant experience so eventually you

624
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:16,270
can upgrade to the CSS P another certain

625
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:18,700
certification at IFC Square offers that

626
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:20,679
I really like is certified secure

627
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,120
software lifecycle professional remember

628
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:24,720
I was telling you about crappy software

629
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:28,029
and the need for people to be able to do

630
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,610
application security the CFS LP is an

631
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:32,380
application security certification so I

632
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:34,899
really like that one they also have

633
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:37,299
others like in cloud and forensic and

634
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:38,678
medical so I don't know that those one

635
00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:51,700
that has as much of the reputation yes

636
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:53,770
sir well excellent question so they have

637
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:57,220
their domains I lift them in here

638
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:59,340
somewhere I think or maybe not so I

639
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:02,620
forgot how many domains they have and

640
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:04,720
your work as a software developer and

641
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:05,860
certainly qualify for at least one of

642
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,309
the domains remember how many domains

643
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:11,559
are 8 where 8 cuz it's all I'm old I'm

644
00:26:09,309 --> 00:26:14,440
old what when we add it Amador's tend to

645
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:18,090
mate yeah so thank you so they domains

646
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:20,169
now but for example one of my friends I

647
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:22,090
think I've endorsed about five or six

648
00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:24,100
people for their for their CSS because

649
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:26,168
you have to have another CSS P basically

650
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:28,629
go through your history your resume and

651
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:30,490
endorse you and one of the I was

652
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:32,200
struggling with her to find relevant

653
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:34,539
experience but then I said well what did

654
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,340
you do during these years she was always

655
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:38,740
doing financial compliance I'm like

656
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:43,029
thank you write it up right

657
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:44,980
compliance is is one of the areas so the

658
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:45,700
links I have down here way I talked

659
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:48,010
about credentials

660
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:50,409
well list the domain and then you could

661
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:52,960
go see okay yeah I fit in this one where

662
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:54,580
do I maybe need to like try to pivot my

663
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,340
career a little bit to try to get

664
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,449
relevant experience and knows alright

665
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:01,178
thank you good question

666
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:03,220
alright so to Rex's point here is the

667
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:04,340
expensive one sans anyone ever hear us

668
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,960
and

669
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:07,610
have anyone gonna do the purple team

670
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:11,110
class that they're doing here

671
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:14,389
anyone got it or you got it awesome so

672
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:15,799
sand I have a you know I have a crush on

673
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:17,210
them as you saw from the first page with

674
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:19,400
all my certification from them and I'm

675
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:22,400
taking my my graduate program with them

676
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:25,070
and I have I have taught a class as a

677
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,990
mentor for them but they were expensive

678
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:29,770
classes are five and six thousand

679
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:31,940
dollars which is why employee

680
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:34,340
educational reimbursement is really

681
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:36,559
really good right if you can get it

682
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:38,480
oddly enough at my employers sands are

683
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,370
not listed as a preferred educational

684
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,980
source but I've been able to submit a

685
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:45,229
waiver and get them approved but not

686
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:49,850
just trained not just expensive training

687
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:51,230
other things so this roadmap this nice

688
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:52,789
little colored box down here is our

689
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:54,590
roadmap so if you go to that link they

690
00:27:52,789 --> 00:27:55,908
will show you here's here's our

691
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,559
different classes in our different

692
00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:58,820
fields because they have compliance and

693
00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:00,740
they have forensics and they have pen

694
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:03,408
testing and cloud all the different

695
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:05,330
things even a legal track but they've

696
00:28:03,409 --> 00:28:06,980
got some really cool free stuff if

697
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:10,879
anyone's looking for a master's program

698
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:13,279
here's the link for their Santa edu but

699
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,320
if you go down to their security

700
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:17,659
resources link if you're a professional

701
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:19,908
already working here they have their top

702
00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:22,100
20 controls which are like what are the

703
00:28:19,909 --> 00:28:23,330
top 20 things to focus on to make

704
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:27,500
yourself secure kind of like the

705
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:29,090
low-hanging fruit then there was also

706
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:31,159
you can get some free stuff if you go

707
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:33,320
down and create a portal account with

708
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:36,169
them they've got new fight which is a

709
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:38,570
regular newsletter of things relevant to

710
00:28:36,169 --> 00:28:42,169
cyber security if you like posters you

711
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:44,178
can get free posters they have tri-fold

712
00:28:42,169 --> 00:28:45,320
for sure and you can download gotta fold

713
00:28:44,179 --> 00:28:49,640
them yourself they don't come fold it

714
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:52,010
but on TCP dump and nmap and well any

715
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:54,559
command that you would use in in the

716
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:57,590
fiber or even just IT world they've got

717
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:59,330
the trifles that are great cheat sheets

718
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:00,559
especially if you work in like a

719
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:02,029
classified area where you don't have

720
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:06,649
access to the Internet in a regular

721
00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:09,799
basis so great resources there this

722
00:29:06,649 --> 00:29:11,539
total a chart I apologize this is

723
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:17,559
reference material what I wanted to

your speaker so I'm gonna talk to you on

730
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:38,550

731
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:42,510
is it oh the woman's Academy do you know

732
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:43,290
about it okay so the so the I looked

733
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:45,450
last night

734
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:46,950
so sans basically has Academy that if

735
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:49,260
you can get accepted you get all that

736
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:52,500
expensive sans training for free you get

737
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:54,120
like four classes or so pretty much

738
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,920
guaranteed job after you get out so

739
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,739
they've got them for veteran they have

740
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:01,170
different diversity one but I look last

741
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:03,630
night and they are doing enrollment for

742
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:05,700
2020 now so if you're at all interested

743
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:08,100
you already work that security field you

744
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:10,500
said yeah and so you get basically you

745
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:12,840
just excluded yourself from that so line

746
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,730
your resume um but if you know anyone

747
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:17,330
who's looking that this might be

748
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:19,770
relevant again if you know any veteran

749
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:23,370
point them to this so all of those

750
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:26,340
programs are listed on here I've had one

751
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:28,290
of my students several years ago I was

752
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:30,449
at a at a security conference met the

753
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:32,399
SANS person they told me about the the

754
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:34,560
woman's Academy I win over the corner

755
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,980
texted all my students like anyone

756
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:39,540
interested apply she applied and then

757
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:41,670
it's just been on an incredible career

758
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:42,830
path ever since so it really can be a

759
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:46,140
game-changer

760
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:48,710
easy counsel there big one they're known

761
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:51,930
for is the ceh certified ethical hacker

762
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:53,280
they but everyone is trying to expand

763
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:54,330
their footprint right so and like I said

764
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,550
IFC squared

765
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:59,010
CSP but they're trying to do other ones

766
00:30:56,550 --> 00:31:01,080
easy council de-age they're trying to

767
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:02,910
expand out one of the interesting things

768
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,139
about easy council when I went look to

769
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:06,270
their website they're now offering

770
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:08,640
bachelor's and master's degrees in cyber

771
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:11,220
security right so everyone's trying to

772
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,020
get into the game and you know I can

773
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:14,700
either confirm or deny the quality of

774
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:18,629
their of their cybersecurity program I

775
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:20,100
don't know much about it so any so you

776
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:23,990
got so far we figured out you have your

777
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,990
security plugs you say SSP any others oh

778
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:27,020
okay

779
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,820
okay awesome all right so we're gonna

780
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:39,149
contest here

781
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:41,159
yes sir okay so excellent question I

782
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:42,780
literally saw on their website that they

783
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,770
have degrees I did not go and look at

784
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:45,660
their website to see if they were

785
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:47,240
accredited I would hope if you're gonna

786
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:49,140
go and you know that they would have

787
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,520
somewhat could like the sands when it

788
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,840
took them one of their problem but they

789
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,690
weren't accredited first they finally

790
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:56,129
got like the youth during so-and-so

791
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:59,130
accreditation so I don't know excellent

792
00:31:56,130 --> 00:32:00,960
question and I'll just have to direct

793
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:04,140
you to the website go look up about them

794
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,340
uh offensive security I think you said

795
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,200
you had one from there too so you're

796
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:10,949
just getting one for me and like and I

797
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:13,560
look like a total fans bro yeah okay

798
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:15,540
so offensive security one in the best

799
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:20,010
way you know them is a creative of Kali

800
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:22,290
Linux that free awesome

801
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:24,930
software tool that or you know it's

802
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:27,930
based on the Kali operating system and

803
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:34,980
in the Swiss Army knife of hacking tools

804
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:37,230
but they have a whole plethora in a1 and

805
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:39,030
again you know the I think the web

806
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:41,150
expert is their newest one right because

807
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:43,980
obviously you want to you want to be

808
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:45,660
competent in that and but one of the

809
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:48,300
things I like about this slide is it

810
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:49,920
reinforces the point Oh like in my class

811
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:53,180
well I didn't even notice an escape I

812
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:55,680
can't can't really kill her anyway uh I

813
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:58,890
you know I want to keep on emphasizing

814
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:00,660
how many different feel there are in

815
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:02,760
there so in my class I teach at Long

816
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:05,900
Beach City College shameless plug

817
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:08,879
I feel hacking and countermeasures it's

818
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:10,500
kind of an inch deep mile wide overview

819
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,720
of all the different field and I always

820
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,890
try to just I just know if you're cool

821
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,560
shirt I'm like checking out what car

822
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:20,960
that is uh yeah squirrel

823
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:24,870
yeah what I like about this is it shows

824
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:27,240
all the area you can focus on when when

825
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:28,350
you go to like Def Con or conferences

826
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:32,400
like that right there are just people

827
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:33,929
who wireless is all they do right at Def

828
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,990
Con there's like this huge wireless

829
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:38,400
village and you know and there are

830
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:40,020
people who focus on you know do the

831
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,150
capture the flag on the web penetration

832
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:44,129
there are so many areas

833
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:45,660
for you to just like focus and this is

834
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:48,510
what I'm gonna do there are people who

835
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:50,910
are just great at being social engineers

836
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:52,890
and and showing companies how they can

837
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:56,010
totally break into the company just by

838
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:58,110
working with the people so I like that

839
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:59,970
that shows in fact I should add a slide

840
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:02,909
for the companies that do the social

841
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:05,100
engineering training note to self

842
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:07,710
alright so if you are already employed

843
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:10,739
the purpose of this slide is to

844
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:13,918
encourage you to use your resources at

845
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:15,689
your current career to steal afraid from

846
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:18,480
another presentation I saw you may

847
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:20,909
already be in in the perfect job and you

848
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,469
just need to basically tailor it to what

849
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:24,510
you want to do and sometimes people are

850
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:26,279
able to do that so you know not just

851
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:28,159
your educational reimbursement program

852
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:31,350
sometimes your employer's will give you

853
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:33,179
access to things such as Linda calm and

854
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:34,370
agree calm so go look and see where your

855
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:37,620
company's giving you for free

856
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:39,239
definitely collaborate company will have

857
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:41,399
like an internal version of LinkedIn

858
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:42,870
where you can go find people who are

859
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:44,219
doing something along the lines of what

860
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:45,810
you want to get interest or what you

861
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:49,500
want to be involved in and you can

862
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:50,730
connect to them go find the cyber people

863
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,230
they're usually alone at lunchtime

864
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:54,330
because the software people do not

865
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:57,090
invite them right I know this from

866
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:59,250
personal experience I know anyone here

867
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:04,170
but I go talk to cyber people they're

868
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:07,620
nice I maybe if anyone was that secure

869
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:09,600
DevOps talked earlier they you know the

870
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:11,880
the woman is speaking air was saying

871
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,529
find a volunteer from the developers

872
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,630
that can help you with your security

873
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:17,070
right so if you're a developer go

874
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:19,680
volunteer and tell your a security

875
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:22,140
person hey how can I get more involved

876
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,520
with with the process so they filled a

877
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:25,950
word in there you know take your current

878
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,660
position and then pivot from there to do

879
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:32,759
something that is more cyber related how

880
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:34,379
are we doing on time we're fine I don't

881
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,770
even I haven't even told you a c-store

882
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:41,100
yet

883
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:44,190
so I'm so afraid to put in the water

884
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:46,049
near my computer what could possibly go

885
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:50,040
wrong

886
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:52,710
so other training resources so LinkedIn

887
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:56,160
learnings anyone formerly lynda.com

888
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:58,410
didn't one have that okay so

889
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:01,379
the good news is well so it can be

890
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:03,060
pricey but ever since LinkedIn inquired

891
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:05,160
them they are pretty much doing whatever

892
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:08,940
they can to make it available for free

893
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:11,850
so on the veterans page I showed that

894
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:13,350
veterans can get it for a year but we've

895
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:17,279
all veterans can get LinkedIn premium

896
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:19,740
for a year but the so of course it's a

897
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,690
paid subscriptions a lot of libraries

898
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,490
aren't offering it for free so I have a

899
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:25,500
link on the slide it was so horrendously

900
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:26,790
long so I just have it embedded in there

901
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:29,040
so you off to download the slides to get

902
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:30,540
that or you can just google how to

903
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,920
access LinkedIn learning for free to

904
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:34,950
public libraries I think that was like

905
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,350
the title of the article but also

906
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:38,640
available through your school so

907
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:41,160
community colleges in California are

908
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,220
able to I don't know if it's California

909
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:45,720
in Los Angeles someone bought a big

910
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:47,279
LinkedIn learning license and is giving

911
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:49,830
it to the students at the colleges so

912
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:53,010
we're having the person come out in two

913
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:56,750
weeks to get my class set up with that

914
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:59,280
so another plug for community colleges

915
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:02,460
since I I will tell you a very quick

916
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,840
side story that so when you remember

917
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,460
that percent didn't anyone go to a

918
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,720
community college let's start off with

919
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:08,580
that anyone okay

920
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,080
so do you remember or maybe it's still

921
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:11,640
occurring today that there was that

922
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,140
perception oh you watch a community

923
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,460
college what happened to you that kind

924
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:16,500
of you know community colleges going

925
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:18,150
aren't good so when I graduated college

926
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:21,300
a million our high school a million

927
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:22,710
years ago community colleges were like

928
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,880
frowned upon that was like oh you

929
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:27,600
couldn't get into it you know finger

930
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:30,830
quote real college and I interviewed to

931
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:32,819
get my Navy ROTC scholarship and the guy

932
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:35,400
looked down to know that me and said

933
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:37,320
perhaps a cyber perhaps a community

934
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,700
college is your best choice right you

935
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,920
know and he didn't mean that as like you

936
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,990
know career building he's like was just

937
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:45,000
looking down at me so 28 years

938
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:48,509
successful Navy career where that guy is

939
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,760
and then you know so now I'm teaching a

940
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:52,050
community college I said it only took me

941
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,810
like 30 years again in the community

942
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:57,180
college so I'm kind of proud of that so

943
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:58,920
anyway cyber Ari anyone ever go and

944
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:00,660
visit cyber so cyber he's got some good

945
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,190
resources they then try to want you know

946
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,990
they try to then get you to pay for

947
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:07,110
stuff right but there's still some free

948
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:09,390
resources on there Splunk pledge that

949
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:09,900
appeared on the veterans page but they

950
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:11,819
also

951
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,770
oh there are other groups that they will

952
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:16,080
give the free training to anyone

953
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:17,759
familiar with Splunk is that name okay

954
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:21,480
if so if you're not familiar with Splunk

955
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:23,220
Splunk is a product that aggregates

956
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:25,380
machine data so anything that's

957
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:27,890
connected to a network

958
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:30,750
they will ingest their data and then

959
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:32,430
allow you to easily search and monitor

960
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,930
it so it's one of the big products out

961
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:35,700
there there are other competitors in

962
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:38,310
there but they are giving free training

963
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:39,870
in there I then also don't forget your

964
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:41,430
Public Library right ever since we you

965
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:43,650
know gave up on physical books people

966
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:45,060
forget about their libraries but again

967
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:46,710
as I said on the top you could get

968
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:50,370
LinkedIn learning from them often times

969
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:52,680
and then also they will have like a free

970
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:54,839
account to Safari so you can go get

971
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,100
technical book for them I direct all my

972
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,870
students do the Long Beach Public

973
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,279
Library to get the textbook as I

974
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:02,040
mentioned on that earlier slide because

975
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,990
I just don't think that book is worth

976
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:06,270
you know and I know a lot of you worth

977
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:07,740
you know a one semester investment and I

978
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:11,220
know a lot of my students are struggling

979
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:14,339
financially so I like to help them out

980
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:16,080
with them alright so I'm the oldest one

981
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:20,250
in the room so this slide only applies

982
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:21,960
to me but just if you happen to know

983
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:24,150
anyone who's maybe a little more

984
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,560
advanced in their career and they're

985
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:27,120
trying to make some transitions tell

986
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:29,759
them about this there are other skills

987
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:31,350
out there but I like it I mean so you

988
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,420
know how older workers can learn new

989
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:36,350
skills and that contrasts with an

990
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:39,840
article I found that the lack of

991
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:41,730
training for older workers is leaving

992
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,890
them behind and in reference that

993
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:47,670
previous slide where I said new collar

994
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:49,440
workers right you know if someone a very

995
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:51,120
quick relevant example I used to work at

996
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,790
a company that did fingerprint systems

997
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:57,440
and mug shot systems and one of my

998
00:39:53,790 --> 00:40:00,320
co-workers went out to Washington DC to

999
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:04,380
implement their new mugshot system and

1000
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:06,240
the person who gave for him to train was

1001
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:07,860
an older woman who would like just

1002
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,540
stared at the computer and looked at the

1003
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:12,270
mouse and like had no idea how to use

1004
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:13,980
any kind of technology the reason why

1005
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:16,140
she was the person to do that because

1006
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:18,080
her previous job was taking the

1007
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:20,460
Polaroids that came out of the camera

1008
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:22,650
cutting them with scissors and taping

1009
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,640
them into a book right she did their

1010
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:25,860
mugshots previously

1011
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,990
camera so now her job went away because

1012
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:29,850
the technology there's a case where an

1013
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:31,649
employer should okay let's get her some

1014
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:33,360
basic computer training first before we

1015
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:35,040
throw her into the deep end and this is

1016
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:37,740
how you use the computer eyes mugshot

1017
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,180
system okay so it's a funny story but a

1018
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,959
little sad too if you're the woman and

1019
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,490
all of a sudden like you

1020
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:44,850
there's no Polaroids for you to cut

1021
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:47,069
anymore uh so networking hugely

1022
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:48,089
important uh you're already doing it

1023
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,320
because you're out she'll Kong has

1024
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:52,950
anyone been to Def Con

1025
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:56,760
oh good number of you b-sides any be

1026
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:59,759
size uh what about layer one okay

1027
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:01,530
few of you there so again an eye chart

1028
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,020
for where you're sitting right now but I

1029
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:06,540
wanted this to be a great reference so

1030
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:09,480
some of the things is si o mas they all

1031
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:11,130
have local chapters woman's society is

1032
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:15,360
Cyber Jitsu and woman in cybersecurity

1033
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:17,160
not just from a woman right the support

1034
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:21,810
you know they welcome advocates as well

1035
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:23,730
a woman in cyber so reverse shell

1036
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:25,950
corporation is the local one for our

1037
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:29,070
area they are really they're helping run

1038
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:31,950
the CTF here yeah capture the flag here

1039
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:33,810
so they're a great group and they are

1040
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:36,359
meeting at Long Beach City College

1041
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:37,590
shameless plug again on a monthly basis

1042
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,060
we just had our first meeting in

1043
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:42,030
September they're skipping October

1044
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:43,320
because of shell con no space labs

1045
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:45,690
anyone ever done anything with null

1046
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:47,250
space labs no okay so there are there

1047
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:50,730
another la-based hacker group they're

1048
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:53,280
more burbank area but they do monthly

1049
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:55,140
lock-picking training so you'll

1050
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,370
definitely two ways to get to them you

1051
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:59,970
can go to their website or you could

1052
00:41:56,370 --> 00:42:01,680
find them on meetup lethal then you're

1053
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:05,279
never been told equal meeting they're

1054
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:10,589
down okay they're down in Costa Mesa I'm

1055
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:12,060
borderline with Newport Beach and they

1056
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:14,160
meet at coastline Community College

1057
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:16,080
which is where I used to teach problem

1058
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,580
with lethal they fill up for as soon as

1059
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:19,740
they send out the announcement right so

1060
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:21,509
if you want to go get yourself on the

1061
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:23,850
meet up on the list for announcement and

1062
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:25,440

1063
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:32,130
announcements like a to am just like you

1064
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:34,650
know trip people up okay yeah so there

1065
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:36,810
is a good point that you know if you

1066
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:37,560
really really want to go you can still

1067
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:39,690
try to sneak your show

1068
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:42,180
down there but they do fill up and then

1069
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:45,200
all the conferences so Anna just came

1070
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:48,480
back from Grace Hopper right

1071
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,890
DEFCON we talked about b-sides I've been

1072
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,750
doing besides Las Vegas for the past

1073
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:54,029
year that's the week of the few days

1074
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:55,950
before Def Con and that's it smaller so

1075
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:58,680
bigger than shell con small in Def Con

1076
00:42:55,950 --> 00:43:00,689
that's a really good one of course shell

1077
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:02,339
con layer one another one to put on your

1078
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:03,900
radar it's coming up in January is AB

1079
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:06,060
set California

1080
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:09,570
if Melia walking around here is part of

1081
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:11,700
their technical track and so that would

1082
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:13,380
be a good one to consider next that's

1083
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:17,149
gonna be at the Annenberg beach house up

1084

1087
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:25,920
awesome location but you just can't get

1088
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,360
there from here I wouldn't own it rain

1089
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,430
that day was on the four or five north

1090
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:38,970
in the rain you know just died a little

1091
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:40,799
that day yes okay alright so yeah so

1092
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:42,720
there's a rhesus woman coming up if you

1093
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:56,670
want to look at that and then they have

1094
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:58,220
a job fair next Saturday right okay so

1095
00:43:56,670 --> 00:44:01,370
if that's not of interest to you find

1096
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:04,100
find Anna fine Malia or go over to the

1097
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:07,410
Louisa's table right outside the door

1098
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:08,910
all right thank you Anna alright so how

1099
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:11,310
do you currently maintain there it's

1100
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:12,899
like so much stuff to read right I don't

1101
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:14,430
know about you but I am overwhelming I'm

1102
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,930
driving to school on Monday night it's

1103
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:17,790
like you pretty much just have to listen

1104
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:19,049
to radio for what was a hack in the last

1105
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:19,950
hour that I'm gonna talk about with my

1106
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:21,000
students because I talked about

1107
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:25,109
something from the morning that's way

1108
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:29,070
too old so there's a various site here

1109
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:30,930
of some good blogs and just daily

1110
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:32,700
reading the really cool thing that I the

1111
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:34,710
reason I added this has anyone ever

1112
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:36,540
worked in the DoD domain it used to be

1113
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:38,070
DISA dot mil you would go do for all

1114
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:39,630
these resources and they recently

1115
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:42,050
changed it to cyber Don Ville right

1116
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:45,780
remember I said cyber the sexy word now

1117
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:46,950
it's a much more modern website but the

1118
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,450
really frustrating thing is what I'm

1119
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:51,390
searching for stuff that I knew was on

1120
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:53,308
dissa and I get the disso Ling

1121
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:55,319
and it just brings you to a splash page

1122
00:44:53,309 --> 00:44:58,230
and he goes oh this is migrated to the

1123
00:44:55,319 --> 00:44:59,640
cyber one and you have to go search for

1124
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:00,960
it on there so it's been a little bit of

1125
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:05,670
frustration but some really good

1126
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:09,480
resources there so Anna you missed this

1127
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:11,430
talk but we had a so the importance of

1128
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,799
networking and when I was at Def Con I

1129
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:15,808
went to a track called sky coffe and a

1130
00:45:13,799 --> 00:45:17,819
police officer from and I always get it

1131
00:45:15,809 --> 00:45:18,960
wrong it's either Idaho or Iowa I am

1132
00:45:17,819 --> 00:45:20,970
from New York and I live in California

1133
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:24,779
everything else is a big square state in

1134
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:27,118
between but the guy was awesome and

1135
00:45:24,779 --> 00:45:29,309
basically he's been a he started off

1136
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:32,490
life as a hacker he was basically

1137
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:34,470
getting shell using fraudulent credit

1138
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:37,140
cards when he was like about 10 or 11

1139
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:39,799
and he got caught because he didn't know

1140
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:42,089
about their ability to track Punk phone

1141
00:45:39,799 --> 00:45:45,089
calls because it was back in the days of

1142
00:45:42,089 --> 00:45:47,308
modem so but fortunately rather than

1143
00:45:45,089 --> 00:45:49,349
putting him through the legal system

1144
00:45:47,309 --> 00:45:51,240
someone said look you've got some really

1145
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:53,970
good skills and you should put him to

1146
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:55,950
good and so you follow his whole story

1147
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:58,649
to where he became a forensic examiner

1148
00:45:55,950 --> 00:46:00,569
and he shows a brief story about how he

1149
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:02,819
helped capture a woman who had killed

1150
00:46:00,569 --> 00:46:04,680
another woman and assumed her digital ID

1151
00:46:02,819 --> 00:46:07,288
all because rather than putting him in

1152
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:09,808
jail and punishing him they said you are

1153
00:46:07,289 --> 00:46:13,410
you're skilled and you could use these

1154
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:15,420
for good instead of evil and he he is

1155
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:17,339
basically trying to get other police

1156
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:20,130
officer to be like minded hacking is not

1157
00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:23,069
bad damaging other people's stuff and

1158
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:24,599
stealing her data is bad so at the end

1159
00:46:23,069 --> 00:46:27,960
of his presentation he basically put up

1160
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:30,809
a shell and he came up with some some of

1161
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:33,359
the bloggers some of the people he

1162
00:46:30,809 --> 00:46:36,329
follows on Twitter so if you're not if

1163
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:37,769
you're not using Twitter you set up your

1164
00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:39,450
account and even if you don't want to

1165
00:46:37,769 --> 00:46:40,919
put anything out there just start

1166
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:43,348
following people in the cyber security

1167
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:45,059
field is just a great way to get

1168
00:46:43,349 --> 00:46:47,069
information and then you'll see a post

1169
00:46:45,059 --> 00:46:48,539
that's relevant of someone you're not

1170
00:46:47,069 --> 00:46:50,190
following so I like that person to

1171
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:52,220
follow one of my favorite Twitter

1172
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:55,440
accounts to follow its internet oh

1173
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:58,529

1175
00:46:58,529 --> 00:47:01,230
Internet connected device that didn't

1176
00:47:00,569 --> 00:47:03,269
need to happen

1177
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:05,480
this week's was did you see the trash

1178
00:47:03,269 --> 00:47:05,479
can

1179
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,940
you

1180
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:48,970
but if so going on reading references if

1181
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:49,950
you've never read the Cuckoo's egg is

1182
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:53,379
anyone read that

1183
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:56,200
okay so mandatory reading one of those

1184
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:58,150
first documented hacking cases really

1185
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,770
excellent book I have not read this one

1186
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:03,369
yet but hackers heroes of the computer

1187
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:04,330
revolutions actually early 80s book but

1188
00:48:03,369 --> 00:48:06,220
then we were talking about some of the

1189
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:07,960
great hacker movie sneakers hackers and

1190
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:09,759
wargames right anyone seen you where

1191
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:11,890
Joel wargames yeah you got to watch that

1192
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:14,890
movie right would you like to play a

1193
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:17,259
game so there's some something for you

1194
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:21,819
to follow it to educate yourself alright

1195
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:27,760
so this is very close to the end but um

1196
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:29,560
so resumes if you didn't know you can go

1197
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,950
get your resume reviewed right out here

1198
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:36,369
but that's what raised me is all about

1199
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:38,109
but so John's opinion on resumes first

1200
00:48:36,369 --> 00:48:40,540
they're an art form meaning you could

1201
00:48:38,109 --> 00:48:42,130
have two people looking at it and one

1202
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:44,230
will love it and one will hate it right

1203
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:46,090
doesn't mean either one is right you're

1204
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:47,020
gonna if you take your resume up to

1205
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:51,310
three different people out there you

1206
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:53,200
will get three different opinions so you

1207
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:54,609
of course always have a resume ready

1208
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,899
right you never know when that

1209
00:48:54,609 --> 00:48:57,609
opportunity is going to come up and

1210
00:48:55,900 --> 00:49:00,760
you're like oh I don't have my resume

1211
00:48:57,609 --> 00:49:02,650
current and then as you have your job

1212
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:05,440
change that you get new responsibilities

1213
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:08,140
update that resume now okay so Asterix

1214
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,790
John's opinion I think you should have

1215
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:11,650
your resume in two different formats I

1216
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:13,900
think you should have a human readable

1217
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:16,330
one for if you're going to go to a

1218
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:17,260
conference and you're gonna be meeting

1219
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:19,450
people and they need to look at it

1220
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:20,710
quickly or if you're gonna go to a small

1221
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:24,848
company that doesn't use a resume

1222
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:29,380
tracking system but for jobs that you

1223
00:49:24,849 --> 00:49:31,810
are applying online you need a resume

1224
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:33,820
that will work with an applicant

1225
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:34,930
tracking system it have people heard you

1226
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:36,580
know who has heard of an applicant

1227
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:38,470
tracking system and it's okay if you

1228
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:42,040
didn't I'm just kind of curious so that

1229
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:44,680
is the computer is between you and the

1230
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:47,770
recruiter and the hiring manager and you

1231
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:50,950
need to get past that in order to you

1232
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:56,170
know advance in the in the job search

1233
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:57,519
and so coincidentally many years ago I

1234
00:49:56,170 --> 00:50:00,069
picked up my wife from work

1235
00:49:57,519 --> 00:50:02,468
in the 90s and she said and she was an

1236
00:50:00,069 --> 00:50:04,929
HR professional and she her and I met

1237
00:50:02,469 --> 00:50:07,269
because she's the one that did my my

1238
00:50:04,929 --> 00:50:10,479
offer letter at Hughes Aircraft in 1985

1239
00:50:07,269 --> 00:50:14,258
so see so you could get married to doing

1240
00:50:10,479 --> 00:50:15,729
this uh the uh she I picked her from

1241
00:50:14,259 --> 00:50:17,589
work she said they have this computer

1242
00:50:15,729 --> 00:50:19,629
system to scan the resumes and no one

1243
00:50:17,589 --> 00:50:21,969
wants to use it and they're asking for

1244
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:25,089
volunteer they said yes yes be the

1245
00:50:21,969 --> 00:50:28,689
person right and that she to this day is

1246
00:50:25,089 --> 00:50:30,819
still doing HR is systems so your resume

1247
00:50:28,689 --> 00:50:32,799
get stand scan putting a database back

1248
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:34,779
when I was young it was put your resume

1249
00:50:32,799 --> 00:50:35,739
on a quality paper and all that no one

1250
00:50:34,779 --> 00:50:37,959
cares about paper because they don't

1251
00:50:35,739 --> 00:50:39,579
maintain it anymore even if you did have

1252
00:50:37,959 --> 00:50:41,319
paper in the first place from the scan

1253
00:50:39,579 --> 00:50:42,699
it in so either you're uploading it or

1254
00:50:41,319 --> 00:50:43,419
you're sending in a paper resume and

1255
00:50:42,699 --> 00:50:46,059
they're scanning it

1256
00:50:43,419 --> 00:50:47,319
the interviews are not interviewers are

1257
00:50:46,059 --> 00:50:49,329
not going to see your original resume

1258
00:50:47,319 --> 00:50:51,009
that's all going to be parsed it's going

1259
00:50:49,329 --> 00:50:53,079
to be searched against the keywords and

1260
00:50:51,009 --> 00:50:55,149
the problem is when they do those

1261
00:50:53,079 --> 00:50:58,089
keyword searches they don't always get

1262
00:50:55,149 --> 00:51:00,489
it right my current job at Boeing I

1263
00:50:58,089 --> 00:51:02,380
first got a letter saying I was no

1264
00:51:00,489 --> 00:51:05,469
longer under consideration for that job

1265
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:06,819
it's like Oh sad music too bad art we

1266
00:51:05,469 --> 00:51:08,529
have a student in our class who does

1267
00:51:06,819 --> 00:51:10,389
great sound effects and when I say sad

1268
00:51:08,529 --> 00:51:14,949
sound he'll like fill in but he's not

1269
00:51:10,389 --> 00:51:16,599
here so awkward silence but then I got

1270
00:51:14,949 --> 00:51:18,519
the job I got a call back in I got the

1271
00:51:16,599 --> 00:51:20,409
job - Andrew hey I got this because all

1272
00:51:18,519 --> 00:51:22,118
I asked him to change the search

1273
00:51:20,409 --> 00:51:24,159
parameters and they dropped everyone

1274
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:26,469
from consideration so the people

1275
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:29,829
managing these systems don't necessarily

1276
00:51:26,469 --> 00:51:33,159
know what they're doing so what I

1277
00:51:29,829 --> 00:51:35,319
strongly strongly recommend is go visit

1278
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:36,939
a website such as job scan now I am

1279
00:51:35,319 --> 00:51:40,299
picking jobs can just because it's the

1280
00:51:36,939 --> 00:51:41,678
one I googled a few years ago in class

1281
00:51:40,299 --> 00:51:44,529
when I wanted to go through one of them

1282
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:47,709
and I did the temporary membership and

1283
00:51:44,529 --> 00:51:50,139
I've been paying for it ever since so I

1284
00:51:47,709 --> 00:51:52,689
keep it current because it's helpful for

1285
00:51:50,139 --> 00:51:55,059
my students go to job scan you can

1286
00:51:52,689 --> 00:51:56,169
upload your resume you can go put in a

1287
00:51:55,059 --> 00:51:58,059
link to one of the jobs you're

1288
00:51:56,169 --> 00:52:00,879
interested in and it will compare them

1289
00:51:58,059 --> 00:52:03,699
and you will be shocked at how low you

1290
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:05,169
score if you're like oh I was a perfect

1291
00:52:03,699 --> 00:52:07,449
candidate for this job why didn't they

1292
00:52:05,169 --> 00:52:08,828
call me back go put it in jobs again and

1293
00:52:07,449 --> 00:52:11,170
you will find out and it will start

1294
00:52:08,829 --> 00:52:13,989
telling you here's how you improve

1295
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:15,609
your resume to raise this score no I am

1296
00:52:13,989 --> 00:52:16,989
NOT saying put in fake things it's like

1297
00:52:15,609 --> 00:52:18,430
oh I've never touched a firewall but

1298
00:52:16,989 --> 00:52:21,849
they're asking for firewall I won't put

1299
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:24,368
that in but in my example plural forms

1300
00:52:21,849 --> 00:52:26,319
of words will trip this up like if you

1301
00:52:24,369 --> 00:52:27,880
put they may say we want you to have

1302
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:30,160
experience with firewalls you said I

1303
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:36,309
have worked on Cisco umpty squat

1304
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:37,660
firewall and it won't match they so as

1305
00:52:36,309 --> 00:52:41,589
you've got as you go through you can

1306
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:43,808
start just online tweaking the the

1307
00:52:41,589 --> 00:52:47,680
resume and you will watch your score

1308
00:52:43,809 --> 00:52:49,809
come up so I really encourage you to do

1309
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:51,160
this how many people are actively

1310
00:52:49,809 --> 00:52:55,329
searching for jobs right now

1311
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:56,769
okay so rags few people so I really

1312
00:52:55,329 --> 00:52:58,450
encourage you to do this I can't

1313
00:52:56,769 --> 00:53:00,640
emphasize enough you'll be shocked and

1314
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:02,470
how bad your scores even even my wife

1315
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:04,868
the HR professional when she was

1316
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:08,348
applying for some jobs and she saw how

1317
00:53:04,869 --> 00:53:11,230
how bad her resume was scoring on there

1318
00:53:08,349 --> 00:53:13,029
just because of terminology or they will

1319
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:15,099
say you know though they'll have a soft

1320
00:53:13,029 --> 00:53:16,329
skill section I'm like you didn't

1321
00:53:15,099 --> 00:53:18,690
mention leadership and this is a

1322
00:53:16,329 --> 00:53:20,920
management position so really really I

1323
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:22,269
do recommend you can do for free and

1324
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:23,710
then you could set up an account so that

1325
00:53:22,269 --> 00:53:25,328
it will keep your you know you can keep

1326
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:27,279
on using their free one but I think it

1327
00:53:25,329 --> 00:53:29,710
doesn't rink retain anything so you

1328
00:53:27,279 --> 00:53:30,970
could do a free one be careful and make

1329
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:35,160
you make sure you cancel it because it

1330
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:40,049
is pricey to keep up the account on that

1331
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:40,049
and I always do this to my clicker

1332
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:50,589
really are you done I don't know why my

1333
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:54,190
thing is that I I think Sparky froze no

1334
00:53:50,589 --> 00:53:55,930
Sparky still with us oh here we go all

1335
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:58,239
right so there's my contact information

1336
00:53:55,930 --> 00:54:00,190
if you want to reach out to me you know

1337
00:53:58,239 --> 00:54:01,480
on LinkedIn if you connect me on

1338
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:03,309
LinkedIn just put a little note say hey

1339
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:04,989
so you're absolutely wonderful

1340
00:54:03,309 --> 00:54:07,150
presentation at joke on so I know where

1341
00:54:04,989 --> 00:54:09,339
you're coming from I don't post a lot of

1342
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:10,390
Twitter uh I definitely don't do any

1343
00:54:09,339 --> 00:54:13,328
politics so you don't need to worry

1344
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:17,410
about that I am mostly about humor and

1345
00:54:13,329 --> 00:54:21,249
cyber or funny cyber stuff so I think

1346
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:25,290
that was it okay so I am going to put it

1347
00:54:21,249 --> 00:54:27,700
on to let you take a picture

1348
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:30,610
and then I'll put it on that one if you

1349
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:32,970
haven't got the the slide yet and then

1350
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:49,510
I've got a couple minutes for questions

1351
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:51,129
yes sir okay okay so very excellent

1352
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:52,720
question and thank you for pointing out

1353
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:53,950
a deficiency in my presentation I really

1354
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:59,560
should change that obviously the focus

1355
00:54:53,950 --> 00:55:02,618
on cyber but yes so so I don't know if

1356
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:04,090
it was on my veteran slide but Amazon is

1357
00:55:02,619 --> 00:55:08,500
actually giving free training to

1358
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:12,850
veterans for cloud services absolutely

1359
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:14,740
Cisco certifications all these vendor

1360
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:17,080
certifications are important because

1361
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:18,669
again remember when I said you don't

1362
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:21,190
necessarily have a cyber title if you're

1363
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:22,420
the switch administrator but you don't

1364
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:24,730
know what you're doing and you don't

1365
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:26,470
administer it properly and it turns out

1366
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:28,390
you know like hey you set up everything

1367
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:30,759
as a mirroring port and everyone's

1368
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:32,350
traffic is going every which way so yes

1369
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:35,440
I think that those that's a very good

1370
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:37,420
point that vendor certifications on

1371
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:40,619
whatever technology we're talking about

1372
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:45,430
are important oh good question thank you

1373
00:55:40,619 --> 00:55:48,040
anything else would the woman who I

1374
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:50,830
insulted like to like to take one more

1375
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:52,900
shot at me no we're good okay Doctor Who

1376
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:55,509
fans so we got that in common all right

1377
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:58,420
so I'll be around both days if you had

1378
00:55:55,510 --> 00:56:00,010
any more questions but go outside it

1379
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:02,020
warm up because like I can't even move

1380
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:03,400
my hands right now all right thank you

1381
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:07,300

1382
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:07,300
