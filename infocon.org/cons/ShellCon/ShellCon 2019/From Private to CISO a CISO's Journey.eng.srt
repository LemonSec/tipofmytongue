1
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:27,189
well hey we're got a small audience here

2
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:29,750
so this will be hopefully a interactive

3
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:31,970
conversation so I'm gonna be just

4
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:34,850
sharing my my journey right there yours

5
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:36,769
will differ but you know I think you

6
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,089
know the military really helped me

7
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,550
personally and some of the lessons I

8
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:41,870
learned from there you know from when I

9
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,220
started straight out of high school I

10
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:45,080
had no clue if I was even gonna start

11
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,390
college right I mean I was so

12
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,430
disorganized and it's like yeah I need

13
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,530
to do something and for me the Marine

14
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,850
Corps kind of kicked me into shape right

15
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:55,789
I was actually going to the Air Force

16
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:57,140
recruiter but the Marine saw me there

17
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:59,149
waiting for the air force guy and pulled

18
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,550
me in and said hey can do you think you

19
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:03,710
can handle the challenge so yeah I

20
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:06,500
actually any of the Armed Forces I think

21
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:08,420
would have been very good for me but you

22
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,430
know personally I started out with just

23
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,560
a high school diploma you know and in

24
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:14,479
some cases barely right because I did

25
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,280
not like school and I just started my

26
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,369
PhD recently right so I've made the

27
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,600
transition from you know going from not

28
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:23,300
quite sure what I was gonna do in my

29
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:26,300
life to starting my PhD just recently so

30
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:28,099
you know the and I directly attribute

31
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,440
that to the military right the Marine

32
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:31,910
Corps specifically but you know anybody

33
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,039
I've ever talked to the military's had

34
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:35,330
kind of a similar journey so I share

35
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:37,069
with you a little bit of my journey some

36
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:39,050
of the lessons learned that I had and

37
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:40,849
you know since we're you know a smaller

38
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:42,410
audience I'd love to get any questions

39
00:01:40,849 --> 00:01:44,959

happy to answer any questions so again I

44
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:56,420
started out got out of high school

45
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,069
wasn't quite sure I was gonna do I

46
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,440
married my high school sweetheart right

47
00:01:58,069 --> 00:02:01,880
after boot camp right I had a kid at 20

48
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,739
right and I'm sitting here in the

49
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,208
military you know trying to figure out

50
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:06,800
what to do and I picked up some very

51
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:09,619
valuable lessons while I was in the

52
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,930
military and one of them was humility

53
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:14,030
right you I learned to be humble I went

54
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:17,120
on ship I was on the 26th Marine

55
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:19,520
Expeditionary Unit in 1993 off the coast

56
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,520
of Yugoslavia for a while and you know

57
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,040
there's a mop a mopping class so I was

58
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:28,580
re3 right a Lance Corporal so guess who

59
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,140
gets them off the floors on ship and you

60
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,609
know I was like are you you're out of

61
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:34,940
your mind why am I gonna go take a mop

62
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:37,520
in class right and a very se

63
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:39,440
gunney of mine and e7 said you know

64
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,360
listen you need to approach every

65
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,040
learning opportunity as something you're

66
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,020
gonna learn from somebody else right

67
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,400
don't be so cocky that you think you

68
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,300
know what you're doing more than

69
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,080
somebody else

70
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:53,000
so with that lesson I went to the class

71
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,860
and I was truly humbled by because I

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,960
truly did not know how to mop a floor I

73
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:01,670
mean I learned a very valuable lesson

74
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:04,220
that day that education and constant you

75
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:05,450
know inquisitiveness and constant

76
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,240
learning we're gonna help me in my

77
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:10,310
career in my life so after I got out of

78
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,310
the military I was a sergeant I had two

79
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,680
kids right I was very you know concerned

80
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:18,890
about what I was gonna do in the future

81
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:21,230
and I I started a job at a company as an

82
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:23,480
engineer right and I took some of the

83
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:24,980
habits from the military with me not

84
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,380
necessarily good ones like I called

85
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:29,359
everyone CERN ma'am and when people do

86
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:31,160
that to me now I actually feel weird so

87
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,020
I learned you know you gotta you have to

88
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,720
kind of adjust for the the civilian

89
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:39,110
world but you know I did this engineer

90
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:41,359
job and you know my constant wanting to

91
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:44,180
learn actually helped me progress I had

92
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,520
created a Linux website that a startup

93
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,080
company bought and I did a start-up for

94
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,150
a while massively failed right I thought

95
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,160
I was gonna be rich but every com

96
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:54,230
happened it failed but I learned a

97
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:57,020
lesson right and every time I've lost a

98
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,190
job or moved on from a job I've learned

99
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,739
a valuable lesson from that and I'll

100
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:02,900
talk about a big one here in a bed I

101
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:05,330
went back to the other company became a

102
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,709
manager you know and the thing that kept

103
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,810
driving us is the things that other

104
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:10,580
people weren't willing to do I was

105
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,260
willing to do right so when I was in the

106
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,850
Marine Corps I wrote some of the

107
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:17,238
procedures that we used in our local

108
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:19,430
office right and in our unit because no

109
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:21,529
one wanted to write documentation well I

110
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,240
started writing documentation and I

111
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:27,049
didn't realize that opened up a very big

112
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:29,419
door for me from that simple act of hey

113
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:31,610
no one has documentation I might as well

114
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:33,650
write it it started a career to where

115
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:36,620
I've written nine books right because I

116
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:38,390
started that that one document people

117
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,220
started to find me say hey nobody else

118
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:42,530
wants to write this documentation we

119
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,600
know you do my career actually has been

120
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:46,309
built on writing documentation right so

121
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,900
every company I've gone to I've written

122
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,680
our information security standards

123
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,508
because

124
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,580
nobody wants to do it even as a see so

125
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:54,470
I've gotten into organizations like well

126
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,729
we just do what feels right right so

127
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,340
I've had to go in and write

128
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:59,840
documentation for the organizations and

129
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,429
again that was a military thing no one

130
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,080
else was willing to do it I applied a

131
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:04,880
little bit discipline by the way I don't

132
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,940
like writing documentation right I saw

133
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,650
something I joy but I used that to

134
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,050
couple it with the learning opportunity

135
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:14,090
so by writing documentation I actually

136
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:18,169
learn and I force myself to learn in a

137
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:19,280
very consistent manner and again since

138
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:21,830
other people don't want to do it that

139
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,508
resulted in books on Linux you know I

140
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:26,120
did hardening Linux invisible ops

141
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:27,530
security a bunch of books and it wasn't

142
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,990
about things I was necessarily an expert

143
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:32,090
in always but I became very very good at

144
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:35,479
it because I was able to articulate to

145
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:38,659
others and teach them how to learn so

146
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:41,120
after the the five to ten year mark I

147
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:44,300
started become a more senior manager a

148
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,630
director you know I was very very

149
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:49,550
focused on my title right so being a

150
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:51,139
sergeant coming out of the Marine Corps

151
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:53,090
you know I was always looked at the

152
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:55,039
lieutenant's the captain's right if

153
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:58,039
hierarchy and rank was very very

154
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:00,409
important to me and I started hounding

155
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:03,110
one of my managers and I said hey why am

156
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:05,090
I not a VP yet right I'm a director I'm

157
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:08,659
running the entire security program for

158
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:11,599
this organization I need to be a VP this

159
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:14,120
person said something that has changed

160
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:16,190
my life he said okay Paul so if we

161
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:20,229
promote you to VP what's next well

162
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:23,180
senior VP okay what's after that I

163
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:25,008
president I mean you know he made me he

164
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,169
asked me a question in a very

165
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:29,150
non-confrontational way that challenged

166
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:32,000
my way of thinking about my whole career

167
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,500
in fact if if you find me on LinkedIn

168
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,780
you'll see I've gone from director

169
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,699
senior director information security

170
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,859
officer senior manager right so you

171
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:42,289
would think I would had gone down but

172
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,750
really the way I looked at it and that's

173
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:46,880
helped me is you know every time I've

174
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,680
made a career transition its healthy in

175
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,530
some way because I always approach it is

176
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,419
even in jobs that I didn't do great at I

177
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:55,419
learned something from it right one of

178
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:59,659
the most prestigious jobs that I've had

179
00:06:55,419 --> 00:07:01,130
I miserably failed at it right now you

180
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:02,520
couldn't tell from the deliverables

181
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:04,169
right because I delivered

182
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,539
every single thing I opened up a massive

183
00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:09,870
market for this company very very large

184
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:11,699
company and I was miserable I hated

185
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:13,500
every single second of it and it was

186
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:15,090
because it was a not a good culture fit

187
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,370
for me right and I learned a valuable

188
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:19,799
lesson from that that if the culture of

189
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,240
the organization doesn't fit you right

190
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,080
you need to move on and you need to

191
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,409
recognize it

192
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,818
I mean I was it was such a jarring

193
00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:28,349
moment that I actually wanted to get out

194
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:30,419
the information security field I was

195
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:32,520
like I I'm clearly not suited for this

196
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:34,440
right then I went to a job that seems

197
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:37,349
like it was a lower job because it was a

198
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:39,449
less prestigious company but it actually

199
00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:41,370
helped me reinforce my confidence and

200
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:43,080
helped me propel to where I am now so

201
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:45,330
you know and that doesn't make the

202
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,620
company that I left a bad company or it

203
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:48,359
doesn't make me a bad person it just

204
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,860
wasn't a good fit right the company is

205
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,479
exceptionally successful with their

206
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,690
culture but it wasn't the type of

207
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:56,430
culture that I was good at so one of the

208
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:58,050
things I would recommend is if if you're

209
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:00,509
in an organization and it doesn't feel

210
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:03,360
right move on and even if it's a smaller

211
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:05,129
role right that smaller role will help

212
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,080
you build your confidence and you know

213
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:09,630
when I left that large company I was

214
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,008
incredibly embarrassed right I did not

215
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:13,169
want to tell anybody about my failure

216
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:15,180
there but then as I started to

217
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:17,130
recondition how I looked at things I

218
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,060
realized it wasn't a failure right it

219
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,669
was a lesson learned

220
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,949
my family was healthy both my kids were

221
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:24,990
okay you know I came out of it with you

222
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:28,289
know my the ability to move on in my

223
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:29,940
career so you know your perspective is

224
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:31,529
incredibly important so that's kind of a

225
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,870
third lesson is make sure the culture

226
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:34,849
fit recognize when things don't work and

227
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:39,719
move on

228
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:43,289
so from there you know I eventually move

229
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:45,690
I found a great mentor and I've worked

230
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:47,550
for this one mentor three times right so

231
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:50,279
another recommendation I give you is if

232
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:52,380
you find somebody who's really good find

233
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:55,470
a way to maintain a relationship with

234
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,610
that person and all her name is Debbie

235
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,709
wheeler she's the chief information

236
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:01,230
security officer Delta right now I

237
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:03,750
followed her her and I have worked

238
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:05,550
together three times in my career at

239
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:09,230
very large organizations and that's

240
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:12,180
because one she appreciated you know the

241
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:13,320
the candor right the transparency that I

242
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,399
always gave I always told her the

243
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,080
problem but I always told her the

244
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,310
solution but her

245
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,200
I've maintained a very strong

246
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:20,640
relationship built off of that initial

247
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,360
thing so if you find somebody who's

248
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,580
really good yeah there the whole slide

249
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,990
now if you find something that's really

250
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,660
and somebody who's really good maintain

251
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:31,920
a relationship for with them and even if

252
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,719
you haven't had the opportunity work

253
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,400
form if you find somebody who it's like

254
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,140
hey I really like what they've done in

255
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,650
their career I want to know more about

256
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:42,900
them open yourself an approach and all

257
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:44,699
volunteer if anybody in this room wants

258
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,439
to contact me and you just want to chat

259
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,390
right I may not have a job for you but

260
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,160
if you just want to talk about hey this

261
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,840
is what I'm going through I'm absolutely

262
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,280
happy to help right because I want

263
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,080
somebody to be able to do that to my

264
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:58,020
kids you know my oldest is twenty five

265
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:00,270
my youngest is almost 21 right and I

266
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:03,180
would love for somebody to be there for

267
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:05,640
my kids you know but also veterans right

268
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:07,709
i we all share a common bond and I'm

269
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,199
here to help as well but even if you

270
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:12,720
don't you know contact me find somebody

271
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,970
who you appreciate open up a dialogue

272
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,040
and a conversation a lot of people think

273
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:18,330
that CISOs aren't approachable right

274
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,610
like you don't want to talk to them or

275
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:22,920
all they don't have time for me if you

276
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:24,570
you start the engagement say hey you

277
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,729
know I just want to understand career

278
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:28,200
where to start right most of us will

279
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,670
talk to you right because we've all come

280
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,800
from the same place right I needed

281
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:35,880
mentors in my career and you should look

282
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:37,709
at that the same way so you know again I

283
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,480
went from becoming a director or senior

284
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:41,010
director then I went to a senior manager

285
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,720
role because I learned that title

286
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:45,120
doesn't really mean much because in

287
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,560
financial services an SDP may be the

288
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,090
same as a director at another

289
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,750
organization so don't get hung up on

290
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,950
your title

291
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,840
all right I've actually talked to people

292
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:53,550
who've said well I can't take your job

293
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,080
because it's too low of a title but it's

294
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:56,819
like well the breadth of it is far

295
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,930
greater than you know the one that

296
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,740
you're at now and you have the

297
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,540
opportunity

298
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,690
but don't close up the opportunities

299
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,980
because the opportunities that I thought

300
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:06,360
that I didn't realize we're good for me

301
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,360
at the time like writing documentation

302
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:12,330
ended up propelling my career and giving

303
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,040
me much more than I even realized so in

304
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,870
the future for me personally the thing

305
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,360
I'm looking for is again I don't care if

306
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:20,490
I if I'm you know let's see so the rest

307
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,470
of my career great I'm actually looking

308
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,300
at becoming I I just became a chief

309
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:26,400
information security and privacy officer

310
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,560
right because that constant wanting to

311
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,970
learn my organization said I hey you

312
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,638
know maybe you take on this

313
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:35,430
privacy role as well you know I went and

314
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,230
got multiple certifications just because

315
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:39,689
again it helps force me to learn in a

316
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:41,519
way and plus I want to understand and I

317
00:11:39,689 --> 00:11:43,139
took this from the military well as well

318
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,089
as I want to understand the other side

319
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:47,370
right so in this case it's not the enemy

320
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:48,839
right it's I want to understand you know

321
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:52,560
who the people I work with are like

322
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:54,660
auditors right I told this story a lot

323
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,739
is that you know I went got my audist

324
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,660
certification because I kept getting

325
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,670
audited it's like gosh these guys are

326
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,680
just beating me up right why they keep

327
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:03,149
destroying me and telling me I'm the

328
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,459
worst person in the world and I can't

329
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:08,670
design a process so I went and got my

330
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:11,758
CIS a and ignore the slides by the way

331
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:14,099
my weight and got my CIS a and you know

332
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:18,149
learned why auditors do the things they

333
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:19,769
do in fact one of my best friends was an

334
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:21,990
auditor who failed me on my first our

335
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:24,149
audit a lot or large organization and it

336
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:26,310
became the best man at my at my wedding

337
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:27,959
right so in actually I just I've hired

338
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,758
this person two times at two

339
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:31,319
organizations right and this auditor was

340
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:33,629
the one who was always the worst to me

341
00:12:31,319 --> 00:12:36,660
but I learned to respect what he does so

342
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:39,629
you know the value this is like the

343
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:42,329
value from that is you know develop

344
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:45,269
those relationships understand you know

345
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:48,809
the people you can work with you know

346
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:50,279
and then from there the the biggest

347
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:52,279
thing I would say the takeaways I've

348
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:55,019
always had build your network

349
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:56,339
continuously improve yourself right and

350
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:58,470
by the way build your network I'm an

351
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:59,730
extreme introvert extremely introvert

352
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:02,160
I'm probably gonna go home after this

353
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:04,290
and lay down and go to sleep right but

354
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,360
you have to force yourself to do things

355
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:09,000
that you wouldn't expect I mean I've

356
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,100
talked to large organizations 1,100

357
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,740
people where I'm the only person on

358
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:16,199
stage right and that is the thing I

359
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:18,029
dread the most but you know the military

360
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:20,189
taught me is like hey go and brace it

361
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:22,709
you know if I can survive boot camp for

362
00:13:20,189 --> 00:13:24,779
13 weeks I can survive anything so go

363
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:27,689
take those chances and even if you're

364
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:29,309
uncomfortable right so you know

365
00:13:27,689 --> 00:13:31,290
continuously improve yourself always

366
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:33,059
learn always learn any class you can get

367
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:35,160
I'd recommend taking it even if it's a

368
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:37,019
mopping class right I mean that sounds

369
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,490
silly right but if somebody offered me a

370
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:41,519
mopping class of T hey maybe I forgot

371
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:43,649
from 93 you know how to mop so let's go

372
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,529
do it again you know get

373
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:49,319
about it you know again see

374
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:51,600
opportunities where you may not realize

375
00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:53,459
they are again writing that first sop

376
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,949
because no one else would do it led to

377
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:57,899
nine books and my entire career has been

378
00:13:55,949 --> 00:14:00,599
the the first six jobs out of the

379
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:03,300
military were all about the ability to

380
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,160
write a standard in the SOP right and I

381
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,779
had no clue that when I did that first

382
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,389
document that that was gonna lead up to

383
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:12,779
where I am now

384
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:14,730
take risks you know that's easy to say

385
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:16,410
right by ship yeah if you don't have a

386
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:18,179
family or your kids aren't at home but

387
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:20,939
you know taking the risks have always

388
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:22,980
helped me I've gone from jobs where

389
00:14:20,939 --> 00:14:24,719
again the title was much lower and in

390
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,309
fact the pay was significantly lower in

391
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,569
some cases but I looked at the

392
00:14:26,309 --> 00:14:30,179
opportunity said hey this is a

393
00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:32,610
leadership opportunity and eventually

394
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:34,800
you know my salary increased beyond what

395
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:36,629
I had had before because I took that

396
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,689
risk and I took I identified the

397
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:40,980
opportunity to be a leader in there

398
00:14:38,689 --> 00:14:42,540
don't focus on title I think I've talked

399
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,089
about that a lot right in the military

400
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,679
title means a lot in the real world that

401
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:48,809
doesn't mean as much as long as you

402
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:51,240
don't let it affect you right if you go

403
00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:52,829
into a job interview someone comes to a

404
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,870
job interview with me and said yeah I

405
00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:56,459
did this and I did this and oh I took it

406
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:58,589
kind of a drop here right you've already

407
00:14:56,459 --> 00:15:00,540
set yourself up for failure right go in

408
00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:01,709
and talk about what you've done at

409
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,420
organizations how you've made a

410
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:04,589
difference and that's what people really

411
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,719
care about they don't care about your

412
00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:08,160
title I don't care about titles honestly

413
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,589
when I interview and I've interviewed a

414
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,300
lot of people you're the title you had

415
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:14,639
at previous companies doesn't mean a lot

416
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:17,370
right I look for do you have the desire

417
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,019
to do the job and are you capable and if

418
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,850
you're not capable quite yet I can work

419
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:22,379
with the EX I can train you but if you

420
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:24,509
don't have the desire and the passion to

421
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:26,459
do information security there's nothing

422
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:29,759
I can do to help you right I won't bring

423
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:32,008
into my organization and then learn from

424
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,480
your mistakes you know I've had many

425
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:36,059
many mistakes in my career I've deleted

426
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,249
logs accidentally that I got yelled at

427
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:40,618
about I've not done the right thing

428
00:15:38,249 --> 00:15:42,119
sometimes for an audit process and the

429
00:15:40,619 --> 00:15:44,519
auditors say hey that's not right and I

430
00:15:42,119 --> 00:15:46,470
just owned it own your mistakes but also

431
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:48,540
come away with it knowing that you know

432
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:50,730
if you're not if you still have your

433
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:53,069
family intact and you're still able to

434
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:56,410
work in the field that paid it's it's

435
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:58,719
not necessarily a bad thing so

436
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:59,890
sorry about the slides well I'm sure

437
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,350
we'll get that worked out are there any

438
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:03,970
questions I mean I'm happy to answer any

439
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:06,340
questions about my personal journey or

440
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:08,400
what it's like to be a CSO or you know

441
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:23,020
information security in general yeah

442
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:24,550
yeah yeah so I was a yeah I had actually

443
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:27,100
had a job to work in the defense

444
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:30,609
industry and I decided to not take that

445
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,780
because for me I wanted the flexibility

446
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:34,060
and the freedom to not have to follow

447
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:36,040
somebody else's rules and they tend to

448
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:38,949
be very rigid especially in information

449
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,540
security right so I was in the I was at

450
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:42,750
26:51 a special intelligence

451
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,890
communicator right so they're very very

452
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:47,320
specific rules I had to follow for

453
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:48,880
anything I did so for me it wasn't a

454
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,470
good fit but if you like that

455
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,240
camaraderie that's great

456
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,410
because there is a risk in the civilian

457
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,360
world that you're not going to have that

458
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:57,100
tight camaraderie that you would have

459
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,480
had in the military I mean and that's

460
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,190
one thing I've missed I'm actually at an

461
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,680
organization where I feel that we have

462
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:04,750
that tight camaraderie but the one that

463
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:08,560
I failed at right it wasn't like that

464
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:10,599
the the organization was very much about

465
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,369
competing with the different business

466
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:14,290
units and again that's not a bad thing

467
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:16,389
I'm not judging them that that worked

468
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:17,649
out extremely well for them that didn't

469
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:19,510
work for me because I want to

470
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:21,700
collaborate and I want us all to succeed

471
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:23,619
as together even if that means less

472
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:25,480
success for me so you have to think

473
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:27,459
about the culture aspects if you really

474
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:30,430
like the military culture and the

475
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:32,650
government culture great but you'll have

476
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:34,780
to make a decision eventually I haven't

477
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:36,820
well I guess that let me recant that

478
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,560
I've not stayed in one industry I've

479
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,120
primarily been in financial services but

480
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,520
I've gone to many different industries

481
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,320
so don't look at it it's like hey I'm

482
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,940
just a I have to work in the government

483
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,500
sector for the rest of my career right

484
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:51,270
does that answer your question

485
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,270
oh yeah

486
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:07,610
yes and I you know some of those I

487
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:10,580
regret right because I had to move my

488
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:14,209
kids around a lot so I move I've lived

489
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:18,830
after I got out of the military in Ohio

490
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:20,900
Seattle Oregon California Kansas North

491
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:22,310
Carolina right so and that's a 20-year

492
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:25,010
I've been in security for 30 years but

493
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,879
in a you know 18 19 year period I moved

494
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:28,340
all around

495
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,960
I moved for the jobs because luckily my

496
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:32,419
family was comfortable being flexible

497
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:34,430
because I had I had my children very

498
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,990
early right I was a lance corporal when

499
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:38,900
I had my first kid so they were used to

500
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:41,750
the lifestyle of moving around but as I

501
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:43,910
look back it's I could have stayed in

502
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:46,370
one location right but I took the easy

503
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:46,790
way right I saw a good offer I just went

504
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:49,699
for it

505
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:51,860
instead of trying to contain my searches

506
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:54,200
within a geographical location so if you

507
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:56,389
have the ability to move around you know

508
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,520
go for it but if you don't don't think

509
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:00,380
of that as a limiter right family's most

510
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,180
important thing right I everyone says

511
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,980
that in 20 years ago people said to me

512
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,750
and I looked at it it's like well yeah

513
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:09,140
but I gotta have money to feed them in a

514
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:10,250
career I look back and you know I I wish

515
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:12,590
I could have spent more time with my

516
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:15,380
kids right there they're amazing men and

517
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:19,310
luckily they it all worked out so don't

518
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:24,590
don't feel like it's a limitation any

519
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:26,000
other yeah oh I'm done okay well oh I

520
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:27,590
have five minutes okay well good even

521
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,410
better are there any other questions

522
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,649
again that this is I'm there no holding

523
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:35,150
back

524
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:36,530
ask me anything you have you want okay

525
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:38,950
good thank you don't leave me hanging up

526
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:38,950
here all right

527
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,990
yeah and actually in I'm gonna answer

528
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:55,320
more than your question here in a minute

529
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:57,059
but as well but the privacy gap privacy

530
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,480
is where security was probably 20 years

531
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:02,220
ago and it's emerging so it's super

532
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,539
exciting it's like all right I get to do

533
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,850
some new cool stuff because I'm very

534
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:08,220
comfortable with the security part of it

535
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:10,709
so bridging the gap is like it's a

536
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,360
natural transition if your organization

537
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,100
will support you on it go for it I've

538
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,649
seen organizations that are very much a

539
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:18,779
it needs to be in legal right or it

540
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:21,299
needs to be X I actually got lucky I

541
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:24,000
work with the general counsel so it just

542
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:25,860
happened to I just get to own privacy so

543
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,190
I think more security people are going

544
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:31,110
to need to know privacy and I went in

545
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:33,510
just got all my privacy certifications

546
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:35,189
recently just because again I'm always

547
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:37,230
curious but that helped build my

548
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:39,450
credibility with my management to say

549
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:41,700
hey he can do privacy as well

550
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:43,019
I'm the other thing that I would say in

551
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,500
this isn't directly related your

552
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:48,779
question is making the transition from a

553
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:52,049
technical to a non-technical person was

554
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:54,210
incredibly difficult for me now I still

555
00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:57,210
understand technology but as a see so

556
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:59,970
you their roles you can be a technical C

557
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:01,950
so and a non-technical C so in my role

558
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:04,200
I'm a non-technical C so so I'm not

559
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:06,000
touching technologies and I'm not you

560
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,769
know configuring firewalls I understand

561
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,720
the basics you're still right and I

562
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:12,240
understand Linux and so forth but I'm

563
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,010
not doing that day today so you you know

564
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,659
make sure that you're thinking about

565
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:17,279
your career again not just from the

566
00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:19,080
title but what do you want to be if you

567
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:21,450
want to be a technical C so start to

568
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,070
manage your career to do the technical

569
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:25,679
stuff but also the management stuff

570
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:27,299
right if you want to be technical and

571
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,710
engineer your entire career you know

572
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:30,990
start to focus on that and don't worry

573
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:35,190
about the title you know become become

574
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:38,490
that more focused individual so for me

575
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:40,350
uh you know I go to classes and I go do

576
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:42,299
trainings on my own and you know set up

577
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:43,889
my own lab just because I still want to

578
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:45,600
maintain my technical portion but I

579
00:21:43,889 --> 00:21:47,610
don't get to do that at work anymore

580
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,439
right I get to talk about the concepts

581
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:51,570
but I don't get to touch anything so

582
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,639
that's just the route I've chosen I've

583
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:55,799
chosen become more of a governance type

584
00:21:53,639 --> 00:21:58,229
of C so as opposed to the technical so

585
00:21:55,799 --> 00:22:00,389
try to think of that if you can now like

586
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:02,220
if you truly enjoy the technology part

587
00:22:00,389 --> 00:22:04,110
make sure that the roles you're taking

588
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:07,490
we'll help you get to that technical

589
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:09,360
Cecil role but if not it's okay right so

590
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:11,159
that'll change how you look at things

591
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,799
whether you go and you know take unix

592
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:16,500
classes or firewall classes or if you go

593
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:18,480
take communications classes and the one

594
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:21,750
thing I always recommend to anybody that

595
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,460
I mentor is that you know the technical

596
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:25,379
stuff your company will pay for that

597
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:27,090
right and it's easier for me to train

598
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:29,639
someone technically than communication

599
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:31,740
wise right so I always tell people read

600
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:33,418
marketing books read sales books Seth

601
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,940
Godin by the way is one of my favorite

602
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:37,769
authors he talks about marketing very

603
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,750
simple to use it's very simple to

604
00:22:37,769 --> 00:22:41,340
understand and he actually changed my

605
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:43,710
life by thinking about things

606
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:45,330
differently but we're all in sales and

607
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:47,370
we're all in communications and if you

608
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:49,168
have that skill that you're gonna get

609
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:50,699
hired at a lot more jobs because you

610
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:52,470
have to open that door by having that

611
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:55,500
communication because I typically talk

612
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:57,960
like military person you know like yes

613
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,970
sir well we're gonna you know I throw

614
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,409
every acronym at the book right I'd be

615
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:03,779
like well we're gonna have DLP and we're

616
00:23:01,409 --> 00:23:04,830
gonna do X and y and my management will

617
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:06,629
look at me like what are you talking

618
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:08,100
about so I've learned to communicate to

619
00:23:06,629 --> 00:23:10,289
say well we're gonna have a program that

620
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:12,990
watches for privacy our private

621
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:14,580
information right so you know try to try

622
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:16,590
to really work on your communications

623
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:19,139
but also try to read sales and marketing

624
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:21,480
books it's incredibly amazing how much

625
00:23:19,139 --> 00:23:23,428
you can learn from salespeople cuz we're

626
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,960
again I'm in sales every single day I'm

627
00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:27,179
selling to the people who work for me

628
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,700
I'm selling to my management I'm selling

629
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:32,279
to our customers I have to sell my ideas

630
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:36,230
to them too in order to get what I want

631
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:36,230
done yeah

632
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:57,710
yeah

633
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:09,908
you can it's very easy to take no risk

634
00:24:07,299 --> 00:24:11,500
but you won't proceed right and I when I

635
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:13,120
interviewed at my last company I said I

636
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,009
can secure this company out of them I

637
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,870
can secure this company out of business

638
00:24:15,009 --> 00:24:18,399
very easily right I just turned all the

639
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:20,199
computers off not allow anyone to do

640
00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:22,508
business but that's not really how

641
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,750
business operates so I've actually just

642
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:27,370
shifted how I think about security

643
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:29,529
security for most companies is not the

644
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:30,939
reason why you buy a product but it's

645
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:32,350
definitely a reason why you would not

646
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,940
buy the product so I always use the

647
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:36,580
analogy and I use a lot of analogies

648
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:38,590
that you know you know it's like a car

649
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:40,210
right you don't go buy a BMW because it

650
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:41,769
has amazing seatbelts like man those

651
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:43,179
seatbelts are awesome right you don't go

652
00:24:41,769 --> 00:24:45,129
and buy it because of that but if it

653
00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:46,720
didn't have seatbelts you probably

654
00:24:45,129 --> 00:24:48,340
wouldn't buy it if you have a family so

655
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,870
if you change your perspective about

656
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:52,750
security that you're there to help

657
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:53,949
management and to help articulate risk

658
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:56,409
to management and what's an acceptable

659
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:58,960
level of risk that kind of changes your

660
00:24:56,409 --> 00:25:00,669
mentality and that you're not you know

661
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,139
you're not responsible for all of it but

662
00:25:00,669 --> 00:25:04,720
you are responsible for ensuring that

663
00:25:02,139 --> 00:25:07,658
people are aware so it's mainly about

664
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,549
communications but again I didn't have

665
00:25:07,659 --> 00:25:11,620
gray hair probably four years ago right

666
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:13,750
and I became a see so about three years

667
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:15,309
ago and all the gray so it is a very

668
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:19,120
very stressful job but you have to go

669
00:25:15,309 --> 00:25:21,100
into it knowing that you know if I the

670
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,689
culture is wide that that's why the

671
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,699
culture is so important excuse me is

672
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:26,919
that I know that my company won't fire

673
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:28,539
me because of that that they would

674
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:30,519
support me but if you work at a company

675
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:31,419
that would fire you over that well you

676
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:33,970
may want to look at a different

677
00:25:31,419 --> 00:25:36,159
organization so I think that's all the

678
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:37,990
time I have again fine feel free to find

679
