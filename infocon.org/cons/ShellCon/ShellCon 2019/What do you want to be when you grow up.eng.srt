job I think in the world because this is

18
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:09,840

our community so thank you for NCC group

22
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,210

00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,179
she goes through all my decks takes out

24
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,520
the corny dad jokes and then I put them

25

29
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:42,509

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,219
because you you put a deck together and

31
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,409
you think man is anyone gonna show up

32
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:48,030

again this is a part of my job so quick

38
00:01:57,749 --> 00:02:01,710
commercial about my employer in thehe

39
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:03,060
group it's a security consultancy that I

40
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,729
work for were based in the United

41
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:09,090
Kingdom but we have eight offices in

42
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:10,710
North America including Canada and so

43
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,170
come check out our booth or a sponsor

45
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,100
about ourselves

46
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,290
so that's ncc group oh they have

47
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,810
security consultancy we're short on time

48
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,120
so let's let's talk about me for a

49
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:26,490
minute just to give you an idea of who I

50
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,670
am Technical Director for NCC group

51
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:31,740
North America I've been in IT since 1995

52
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,059
and started specializing in InfoSec in

53
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,190
2001

54
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,740
that's when the.com bubble burst

55
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:41,420
so that was a really good time to kind

56
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:44,160
of change gears I studied music at a

57
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:47,630
Louisiana State probably not a whole lot

58
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,190
of Tiger fans in here in California but

59
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:52,829
go Tigers and then I went to grad school

60
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:55,500
in 2005 got a Master of Science and

61
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,690
information assurance so that context

62
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,550
will be important in a minute currently

63
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,740
or the first half of my career I did a

64
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:04,680
lot of blue team info sex on the

65
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:06,540
defensive side in Houston Texas where

66
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,510
I've lived that whole time

67
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,700
health care is really big oil and gas is

68
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:14,370
really big but I've also done a little

69
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:17,399
bit of DoD work and aerospace at Johnson

70
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:19,260
Space Center so now you know about me

71
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,450
here's what we're gonna talk about that

72
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,489
I have several goals that hopefully you

73
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:27,299
will find useful we're going to talk

74
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:29,130
about InfoSec where i'm gonna tell my

75
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,690
story a little bit and then we're gonna

76
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:32,400
talk about some of my friends and

77
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,570
colleagues the case studies that i've

78
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,860
put together and these are people that

79
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:37,680
I've worked with and have a great deal

80
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:41,459
of respect for and kind of the goal here

81
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,550
is as as an industry how did we get here

82
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:50,090
where are we going and how will we get

83
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:53,970
to that eventual destination so goals

84
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:55,050
those are some goals thank you yeah see

85
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:59,130
that's one of the jokes you said I

86
00:03:55,050 --> 00:04:00,810
should so the goals are this is not me

87
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:03,060
standing up here saying I've been in

88
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,320
industry for 23 years and you should

89
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,260
listen to me because I have a great

90
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:09,150
beard this is about talking and if you

91
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,609
read my abstract there's lots of points

92
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,739
of entry into various industries and

93
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,780
predictors of success but there's not

94
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,820
very well defying the points of entry

95
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,000
and predictors of success for

96
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,560
information security and I started you

97
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,240
know several years ago thinking about

98
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,950
you know how have my friends and

99
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,250
colleagues gotten into this industry and

100
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:31,229
they have they take taking a similarly

101
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:33,360
unusual path and and as it turns out

102
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:35,850
they have so that's kind of the goal of

103
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:41,669
this as far us to kind of help each

104
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:45,210
other realize that there is

105
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:46,620
all right so that one worked I learned

106
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,969
these things the hard way a lot of the

107
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,830
lessons I'm going to share with you I

108
00:04:47,969 --> 00:04:51,449
was a very successful systems

109
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,669
administrator because I had learned

110
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:56,009
every possible way to screw up a Windows

111
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:59,870
server that exists and then I had to fix

112
00:04:56,009 --> 00:05:02,340
it so you know let me be your warning

113
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:03,569
has I go through some of this stuff so

114
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,279
let's start talking about our industry

115
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:07,259
first of all the history of information

116
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,389
security if you've been in the industry

117
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:11,849
long enough InfoSec was kind of

118
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:14,159
ancillary to whatever your day job was

119
00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:16,830
right there was no formal information

120
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:18,419
security team or if there was it might

121
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:22,318
have been focused on access and

122
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:24,330
authorization for example updating

123
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,189
software was primitive especially in the

124
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,318
windows world you would patch a server

125
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:30,330
when you built it and then you would

126
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,969
patch it again when you rebuilt it three

127
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:35,099
years later there was no Windows Update

128
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:37,259
you had to download each patch

129
00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:39,569
individually and who's got time for that

130
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:41,999
so as I will tell you as a systems

131
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:45,270
person I never patched my boxes back in

132
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:48,120
the 90s so when did our industry start

133
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,529
as we understand it today I mean there's

134
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,180
been people that have been working in

135
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:52,800
security for a long time so I started

136
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,409
looking at some interesting dates I

137
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,710
selfishly put in CC Group first we were

138
00:05:55,409 --> 00:06:00,569
founded in 1999 excuse me we came out of

139
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:03,770
the Ministry of Defense in the United

140
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:08,669
Kingdom but became a private company and

141
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:10,710
99 DEFCON started in 1993 any of you

142
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:13,258
that used to be scanner junkies like me

143
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:15,870
you remember when the scanner Satan came

144
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:18,029
out does anyone remember that one that

145
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:21,710
was in 95 and then the kind of

146
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:23,699
commercial version of that was Saint in

147
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:25,529
1998 by the way I always thought the

148
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:27,180
folks that wrote Satan they were clearly

149
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:30,149
not marketing people right because

150
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,379
that's not probably a good acronym to

151
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:33,449
name you're you know not a good

152
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:35,969
affiliation to have with your software

153
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:39,060
product ioactive he's also a sponsor

154
00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:42,180
here is founded in 1998 white hat and

155
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:45,089
Metasploit lares trusted SEC all of

156
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:48,029
those firms were in the in the 2000 so

157
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:51,029
in my mind I think of our industry as it

158
00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:53,159
exists today is basically being a couple

159
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:55,050
of decades old and that's up for debate

160
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:57,419
some people say no it's been around

161
00:06:55,050 --> 00:07:00,449
longer than that but four in my mind I

162
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:04,500
think of us as an industry is being you

163
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:07,620
know in our twenties so we're kind of

164
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:12,500
you know we're young adults as an

165
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:14,580
industry so with that having been said

166
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,560
let me keep an eye on the time there

167
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,419
okay the history of Damon I already said

168
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,650
this is an older version of my slide

169
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:26,008
deck you can see the beard is much

170
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:28,530
shorter back then so I started you know

171
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:30,780
studying music and as it turns out

172
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:33,378
there's a lot of really good drummers

173
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:36,599
out there in the world and and you know

174
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:38,430
1% of the people make 99% of money and

175
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:40,378
that isn't really consistent with the

176
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:42,960
lifestyle I wanted and so I became a

177
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:45,870
computer nerd quite by accident I worked

178
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,909
in the LSU recording studio and thought

179
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:49,469
the technology with the digital editing

180
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:51,870
was more interesting than the things

181
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,520
that I was recording so I found the

182
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:55,169
technology more interesting and as I

183
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,349
learned more and more about managing

184
00:07:55,169 --> 00:08:02,219
systems I fell into a systems

185
00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:07,229
administrator when you know the dot-com

186
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:10,349
thing was still fast and furious so I

187
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:12,270
very much kind of got my start by

188
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:14,310
accident and I kind of carried that

189
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:17,698
guilt around for a long time thinking

190
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:19,830
now I'm not a real InfoSec pro you know

191
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:24,449
I wanted to be a drummer and I this is

192
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:26,190
just what you know I can do and and I

193
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:28,469
mentioned the music thing I'll call that

194
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:32,820
out do you remember so I studied music

195
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:35,279
do you remember this incident I felt so

196
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,860
bad for her because every Twitter went

197
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:40,469
crazy and said she's got music degrees

198
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:43,579
oh wait a minute I have a music degree

199
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:46,470
so obviously you know and fortunately

200
00:08:43,578 --> 00:08:48,149
Twitter came back to its senses and

201
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,770
people said wait a minute it has nothing

202
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:52,079
to do with the sea so there were

203
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:54,449
systemic problems in this organization

204
00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:56,760
and her education had nothing to do with

205
00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:59,729
that and I still believe that to be true

206
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:02,189
and we'll talk more about that later so

207
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:05,010
my path into this industry was you know

208
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:07,869
as in music I got a job recording studio

209
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:10,749
and then I got into high tech

210
00:09:07,869 --> 00:09:13,359
so I kind of the path was I had some

211
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:15,429
experience that I got and then I started

212
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:17,769
doing formal training after I already

213
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:21,429
had the job and then I mentioned I went

214
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:25,179
back to school in the 2000s and and got

215
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:27,189
a master's degree when my son was a

216
00:09:25,179 --> 00:09:33,429
newborn by the way don't that's the

217
00:09:27,189 --> 00:09:35,949
worst time to go to grad but so speaking

218
00:09:33,429 --> 00:09:38,348
of those things education training and

219
00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:40,718
experience you know I apologize it's a

220
00:09:38,349 --> 00:09:43,149
little dark up there isn't so I made

221
00:09:40,719 --> 00:09:44,889
this Venn diagram because every slide

222
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:47,229
that has two haven't been diagram and

223
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:48,819
I'm not so I believe that education

224
00:09:47,229 --> 00:09:51,249
training and experience are the three

225
00:09:48,819 --> 00:09:53,919
big blocks that you need to have in some

226
00:09:51,249 --> 00:09:57,299
combination and I'm not in love with the

227
00:09:53,919 --> 00:10:01,959
text that we're where it overlaps these

228
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:03,489
could be representative and I think if

229
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:05,949
you know you're focused on training and

230
00:10:03,489 --> 00:10:10,269
education maybe you're gonna work in an

231
00:10:05,949 --> 00:10:12,399
academic sort of career if you're heavy

232
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:14,919
on education and experience you might be

233
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,929
a really good generalist and that's not

234
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:19,779
a bad thing I mean we you know being a

235
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:21,339
generalist is good and if you're heavy

236
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:22,989
on experience and training maybe you're

237
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:25,569
some sort of specialist subject matter

238
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:27,099
expert and in the middle of all that I

239
00:10:25,569 --> 00:10:28,569
suggest that you know to be a

240
00:10:27,099 --> 00:10:30,249
well-rounded professional you have to

241
00:10:28,569 --> 00:10:32,889
have some amount of all of these things

242
00:10:30,249 --> 00:10:34,419
but I'm not gonna say that you have to

243
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:35,919
have all of those things so I don't want

244
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:37,629
to get hate mail people saying oh I

245
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:39,269
don't have a degree so you're telling me

246
00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:43,029
I can't be a well-rounded professional

247
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:44,919
absolutely not true but just again in

248
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:46,869
terms of framing the conversation when I

249
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:49,239
talk about education experience and

250
00:10:46,869 --> 00:10:51,339
training these means this is the picture

251
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:52,329
I see in my head if you disagree that

252
00:10:51,339 --> 00:10:54,999
that's awesome

253
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:57,628
tell me about it because I want to be

254
00:10:54,999 --> 00:11:01,329
smarter when I'm done with this as well

255
00:10:57,629 --> 00:11:04,089
so experience let's talk about that for

256
00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:06,459
a minute well what is experience well if

257
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:09,099
you've seen this movie experience is not

258
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:11,679
doing the same thing every single day

259
00:11:09,099 --> 00:11:14,139
for a really really long time experience

260
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:16,569
needs to be an iterative process we're

261
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:19,779
doing different things over a period of

262
00:11:16,569 --> 00:11:20,880
time so if you find yourself you know in

263
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:23,290
somewhat of a

264
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:27,460
professionally where you feel like

265
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:30,040
you're in Groundhog Day keep an eye on

266
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:33,010
that because eventually you could get

267
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:35,110
pigeonholed into you know a role that

268
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:37,720
you can't get out of so if I'm giving

269
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:39,460
advice to people I'd say you know I'm

270
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,010
not saying you have to change jobs every

271
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:44,530
year but always be cognizant of the fact

272
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:48,700
that you make sure you're not living in

273
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:52,750
Groundhog Day and that will include

274
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:54,400
leaving your comfort zone and making

275
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:57,790
sure you have a good support network

276
00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:00,880
including mentors and just a quick word

277
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:03,010
about mentors I've had I can't count the

278
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,850
number of people that have helped me in

279
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:08,470
my career when they didn't have to and a

280
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,840
mentor doesn't have to be someone that's

281
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:13,300
older than you are I have two guys that

282
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:15,310
I work with several years ago and I'm

283
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:18,520
still friends with them both that are

284
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:21,699
closer to major sons age than they are

285
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:25,060
to mine but they had experience and

286
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:27,250
skills that I didn't have and so even

287
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:29,890
though they were younger they had

288
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:31,690
something to offer to me so I think we

289
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:33,880
all agree you have to have mentors but

290
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:35,380
don't limit yourself you can get great

291
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:42,340
mentorship from unexpected places

292
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:48,610
sometimes so that's that Alright

293
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:49,840
training so all these QR codes I promise

294
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:51,760
they're not malicious links I just

295
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,710
wanted to give credit to all the photos

296
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:58,120
I stole off of Google so this is from

297
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:59,890
someone's blog Chris Inge who loves to

298
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:05,350
talk about the fact that he's not a CIA

299
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:08,110
SSP I am but you know see a training can

300
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:10,980
solve it is one predictor of success of

301
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:13,120
many so don't immediately dismiss

302
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,010
training if it involves a certification

303
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,200
when you get to the case studies part

304
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:20,380
I'll talk about the different people

305
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,220
that I know who have that had who place

306
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:28,860
different values on on on training

307
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:28,860
specifically and education of course

308
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:36,160
it is also important but like I said my

309
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:38,140
first degree was in music so you know

310
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,040
did my music degree help me get that

311
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:44,770
first systems job probably not although

312
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,719
my first boss was also a percussionist

313
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:49,360
coincidentally so maybe that did help

314
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,580
out but I didn't you know finish the

315
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,770
music degree because I knew it was going

316
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:57,460
to you know further my high tech career

317
00:13:53,770 --> 00:14:00,850
I think I'm a big believer in education

318
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:02,740
for education sake and here's my example

319
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:06,010
if you live in Houston you you're

320
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,480
automatically a fan of Johnson Space

321
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,580
Center in the space program and if

322
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:13,600
you're not then they politely ask you to

323
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:16,600
move to Oklahoma story Musgrave is my

324
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,700
favorite astronaut because he is a big

325
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,680
believer in education for education sake

326
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,510
so he's the guy that put the glasses on

327
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,160
the Hubble Space Telescope

328
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:26,230
so as the he did the extra vehicular

329
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,760
activity where they fixed the Hubble and

330
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,870
when you're training for a mission it

331
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,750
can take years and years and years and

332
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:33,640
years so story living down south of

333
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:36,820
Houston near University Houston Clear

334
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:39,520
Lake would collect degrees he's got

335
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:42,700
seven degrees he is a flight surgeon so

336
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:47,230
he's a medical doctor but he also has

337
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:52,089
degrees in aerospace in literature and I

338
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:56,140
can't remember the others his it was

339
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:57,970
already there there it is okay there's a

340
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,410
really interesting wiki article about

341
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:02,110
him put it there for this all of his

342
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:04,329
degrees but you know does does his

343
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:06,490
literature degree help him be a better

344
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:08,320
astronaut well probably not maybe when

345
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:10,360
he's doing those days and he gets bored

346
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,339
he can go through you know his catalogue

347
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:15,910
of you know stories he's read or

348
00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:18,490
whatever but he just enjoyed education

349
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:20,469
so if you don't have a degree it's not

350
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:22,209
going to mean that you're not you can't

351
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:24,370
be successful but at the same time if

352
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:26,699
you want education just because learning

353
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:30,220
can be fun then that's okay too

354
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:31,779
and so I think of story Musgrave when I

355
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,820
think of you know when people ask me oh

356
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:36,010
do you regret having you know got in the

357
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:37,510
music degree well no of course not I

358
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:40,930
mean my career didn't go the way I

359
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:43,209
thought it was going to but that that's

360
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:45,279
how life works sometimes so the case

361
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:48,099
studies here this is a consult

362
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,779
it was very early in his career he kind

363
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:53,199
of went a traditional route and got a

364
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:54,879
four-year degree deciding he decided

365
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,910
that hacking was cool when he was still

366
00:15:54,879 --> 00:16:00,189
an undergrad but he assumed that the

367
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:03,519
only way to get into InfoSec was by

368
00:16:00,189 --> 00:16:04,899
going through IT and he and he didn't

369
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,249
want to be a developer so he thought

370
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:08,649
well if I'm going to get into hacking I

371
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:10,449
first have to go into IT by the time he

372
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:13,990
graduated in 2014

373
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:16,508
InfoSec jobs were becoming more and more

374
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:18,970
common and bypassing IT and going

375
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:22,059
straight into InfoSec by that point was

376
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:24,309
not surprising like it once was

377
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:26,680
everybody that's of my age are similar

378
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:28,269
we all came through the systems world

379
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,489
yet just because that's how the world

380
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:31,569
worked at the time he had some

381
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,339
interesting quotes when I was

382
00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:35,769
interviewing him he said he wish he had

383
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:38,139
done defense first and as a former Blue

384
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:40,120
Team guy I was thrilled to hear this

385
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:42,129
because I told my clients you know I've

386
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:45,610
worked for a consultancy defense is

387
00:16:42,129 --> 00:16:48,100
harder than offense full-stop and it

388
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:50,439
always will be I bring in the team of

389
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:52,870
red teamers you hack all the things we

390
00:16:50,439 --> 00:16:54,399
drop off the link to report give you the

391
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:56,319
invoice and then just out of it

392
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,329
meanwhile you've got to fix all the

393
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:00,670
problems and also defending your

394
00:16:58,329 --> 00:17:04,240
organization day in and day out it's a

395
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:08,530
lot easier to be offensive and I don't

396
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:11,189
mean on offense then it is defense and

397
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:13,480
to hear him say that I think that's true

398
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:15,189
he fought he says he gets better at

399
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,839
application assessments by actually

400
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:18,610
building software so even though he said

401
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:21,849
that he didn't want to be a developer as

402
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:23,948
he became an information Pro security

403
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:25,389
Pro he started building software and

404
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:28,690
that made him better at breaking

405
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:30,909
software and he kind of had a cynical

406
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:33,610
view on training you know I talked about

407
00:17:30,909 --> 00:17:35,559
training and and all that he thinks

408
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:36,879
experience is the most useful thing and

409
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:38,440
I'm not saying he's wrong but you know

410
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,360
every time he would take the class he

411
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,460
couldn't get more turned off on training

412
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,689
I think you know that might speak to

413
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:48,690
your invasion

414
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:51,789
important than the concept of training

415
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:56,460
but that was his point of view he took

416
00:17:51,789 --> 00:17:56,460
the traditional use

417
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:06,750
[Music]

418
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,919
[Music]

419
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:32,049
[Music]

420
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:46,459
there was a lot of people that left ie

421
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:49,940
all together

422
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:51,530
I suppose the Jews the state he had to

423
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:57,100
kind of reinvent ourselves

424
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:57,100
so why what is happening now as a result

425
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:03,590
he still says the English degree is a

426
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:07,070
great degree necessity to consulting to

427
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:10,570
doing a lot of work and as it turns out

428
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:13,010
in a clear concise manner as his party

429
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:15,110
creative people to do and so a new post

430
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:17,540
a high degree them completely every

431
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:25,300
security company I work for has enough

432
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:28,580
musicians to start working folks and

433
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:32,060
reading he major points into difference

434
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:37,000
between credential training life stream

435
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:37,000
so his security crime does a lot of

436
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:44,630
testing so hemming that Peninsula cissp

437
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,820
is actually very important because many

438
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:51,590
of those claims will I see that there's

439
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:53,540
some formal credential so based on two

440
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,970
different problems you know taking

441
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:58,730
trainings and get some letter them is

442
00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:00,940
not a bad thing just understand their

443
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,940
solve

444
00:20:43,090 --> 00:21:34,490
so see it inspires me to improve even

445
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:36,980
the expert team means opportunity this

446
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:39,070
the smartest people I know are some of

447
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:41,870
the people men say oh I don't know

448
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:49,120
remotes because you can't know

449
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:49,120
everything don't be insecure none of us

450
00:21:53,620 --> 00:22:03,409
I think that's a pretty safe device so

451
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:05,330
it isn't even not so have you ever seen

452
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:08,290
this picture I love this picture of it

453
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:10,699
and that's where I'm stolen from then

454
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:13,428
this is the perfect example

455
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:16,870
what impostor syndrome feels like for me

456
00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:16,870
it feels like

457
00:22:23,260 --> 00:23:45,680
but it's earlier this is question here's

458
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:51,500
why he said I can't fix on a printer

459
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:53,960
that can fly but there's no support can

460
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:56,540
something exposed in the oil and gas and

461
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:58,340
that gave them deeper experience to know

462
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:03,020
how to run a helicopter company even

463
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:05,000
though self so you know I've run an

464
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:06,770
airline to get this around my people who

465
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,170
understand those things so I got into

466
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:11,170
management a number of years ago I can't

467
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:18,800
but I'm able to help me and blind the

468
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:20,860
business because I make sure they

469
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:23,629
surround myself by people

470
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:26,750
so I can focus on doing the business

471
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:32,240
sorts of things and then I have smart

472
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:34,280
people around there actually so

473
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,080
sometimes it's better to not be a

474
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,760
subject matter expert to run the company

475
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,649
because we tend to call them welcome to

476
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,960
technology so if you find yourself

477
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:44,390
pulling down the pounds are getting into

478
00:24:41,960 --> 00:25:25,040
veneers in polar regions men just know

479
00:24:44,390 --> 00:25:26,870
their technical skills and so learning

480
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:33,190
opportunities and the last three I'm

481
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:38,510
sure with you check out this this story

482
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:40,400
but basically it says the new being a

483
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:42,110
chauffeur once upon a time was the best

484
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,670
job to have because automobiles were

485
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:46,459
expensive they were difficult to

486
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:48,470
maintain and so commercial verb you

487
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:50,090
learn very much a position of power you

488
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:55,640
got to drive somebody else's expensive

489
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:58,370
vehicle and maintain it and get them

490
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:00,380
around and the technology advanced and

491
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:01,129
honorable able to a chamber easier to

492
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,230
operate

493
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:07,310
metal being a chauffeur is not the

494
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:10,970
powerful and new position once was so

495
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:11,540
the lessons are costs when the best boat

496
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:13,070
is here

497
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:15,470
knowledge is power long life is

498
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:19,600
temporary power from outlets close what

499
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:23,720
one person knows another can also go in

500
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:25,520
or the common it was very easy

501
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,400
persistence people become very very

502
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:31,430
arrogant because we bring the gas yo

503
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,490
business without us you don't exist in

504
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:35,640
that every

505
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:38,040
finis on the backside and all those

506
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,990
businesses go away so prepare we need to

507
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:43,200
prepare Arsenal's InfoSec that's not

508
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:45,510
obviously mean like it is today it is

509
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,070
going to change and we need to stay

510
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:49,950
ahead of that curve to make sure we're

511
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:53,580
still valuable to market organizations

512
00:26:49,950 --> 00:27:01,530
and that change happens so symptoms for

513
00:26:53,580 --> 00:27:03,689
yourself as for setting goals for

514
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:05,580
yourself though be patient with this

515
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:07,950
video business is not the same as the

516
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:11,100
speed of light some life businesses take

517
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:13,260
a long time to affect change how be

518
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:15,389
self-aware I went through kind of a

519
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:18,270
professional purgatory at some point in

520
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:20,700
my career and jump the jumping job and

521
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:23,700
they were all terrible and I thought man

522
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:25,770
how talk about having bad luck I kept

523
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,900
having these picking with bad warriors

524
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:29,760
what are the chances of that happening

525
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,080
and then one day it hit me like a ton of

526
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,460
bricks the only thing that does the

527
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:39,470
physicians had in common was me know

528
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:43,410
will make me that sure enough I had some

529
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:44,910
successful career and then that's that

530
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:51,960
was not fun figuring that out

531
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:54,720
but I realize so concluding remarks this

532
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:57,059
moral of this story there's no right way

533
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,309
to get in this industry no wrong way

534
00:27:57,059 --> 00:28:01,139
how many Pro seconds of life in business

535
00:27:59,309 --> 00:28:04,530
got a continue to change and a

536
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:09,179
department so we prepared for that it's

537
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:13,070
not gonna be a wild west so we have to

538
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:16,980
adapt some totally requires that regular

539
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:19,260
valuation probably in mind once it's not

540
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,490
gonna be our need every single day

541
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:25,940
that's why they call my work and they

542
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:28,620
give us money to do it so that's them

543
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:30,300
through my story I I found the story

544
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:32,159
about the bus but I don't have time sort

545
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:34,230
of cuts me afterwards and happy it's

546
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:37,280
only the bus story I think it's relevant

547
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:37,280
without all the clothes

548
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,099
[Music]

549
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,960
