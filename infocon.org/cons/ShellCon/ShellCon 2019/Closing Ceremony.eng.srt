1
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:13,230
[Applause]

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:14,490
everybody itself that was great

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,740
I really have to travel for like 10

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,060
minutes anybody pays attention so yeah

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,339
if you're standing out mahallae

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,840
if you can come in

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:39,019
important stuff to say everybody today

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:43,100
so first of all but the fun doesn't stop

9
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:45,050
here so I wanted to look at some stuff

10
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:49,129
that we were really proud of this year

11
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:51,949
so some statistics from wrench so we had

12
00:00:49,129 --> 00:01:06,710
203 Sadie's attending tickets that's a

13
00:00:51,949 --> 00:01:11,330
65 percent increase from last year we

14
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:12,979
had a 176 tickets between the speaker

15
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:17,440
your sponsors are going to be tables

16
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:19,880
workshop presenters and raised me so

17
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,408
that's basically the number of people

18
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:25,880
that it took to pull this off over the

19
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:29,090
weekend so because the bank so that

20
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,530
brings us up to a total of 22 and that

21
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:38,270
doesn't count all the people that count

22
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:42,049
fitted their badges so I want to thank

23
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:44,929
our sponsors so this complex would be

24
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:46,640
horrible without them and we've had a

25
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:48,740
really good relationship with several

26
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,920
responses from the beginning and she'll

27
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:54,759
come they supported us they put time and

28
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:59,990
energy into finding ways that they can

29
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:03,890
inject an energy into the community they

30
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:05,719
sponsor specific events they work with

31
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:08,360
me to figure out how best we can use

32
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:10,869
their resources so let's give all the

33
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,869
sponsors at

34
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:24,440
a bead said did you and your company

35
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:26,690
think that there's a spot for you at

36
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:31,490
Showtime we love to talk to you so come

37
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:44,810
up with find me afterwards okay

38
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:47,870
so if I could have you come up third

39
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:52,220
year at UC 5 6 q is there with a bar

40
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:53,660
seen from the CTF competition I think it

41
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,950
was a pretty good year overall every

42
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,560
year we have something else we have to

43
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:58,940
do this year as well but I think in the

44
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,310
end it was pretty enjoyable for

45
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:04,100
everybody so first place aside because

46
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:05,900
the prices that we have somewhere up

47
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,140
here awesome

48
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:11,650
so first place we have them at the peep

49
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,649
you're gonna get the

50
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:46,980
because as a an original MFP I was very

51
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:50,130
proud of my team but also I wanted to

52
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,780
heckle I was kind of torn on this was

53
00:03:50,130 --> 00:04:06,329
the closest here I think we've ever had

54
00:03:51,780 --> 00:04:09,770
I think the first place they're going to

55
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,770
get the raspberry pie

56
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:43,180
at least we had in third yeah awesome so

57
00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:44,859
thank you for everyone who competed we

58
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:49,300
hopefully will be back again next year

59
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:50,590
from Chelsea and event is something that

60
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,449
where you are we learn from every year

61
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,909
as well so we hopefully configure better

62
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:56,889
here if you are interested in helping us

63
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,530
we are always open to challenge creation

64
00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:01,539
this up and if you're in the LA area be

65
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,888
sure to check out our partners RC they

66
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:05,580
do a lot of local community work and

67
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:05,580
efforts

68
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,979
[Applause]

69
00:05:15,059 --> 00:05:20,770
so next contest we have is ET skier

70
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:22,930
every day period so the cannibal will go

71
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:26,650
ahead come on up this is a brand new

72
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:28,809
contest for this year it has never been

73
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:32,099
done anywhere else so I won't give him a

74
00:05:28,809 --> 00:05:32,099
chance to talk a little bit about it

75
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:45,039
so you see engineer is when we were

76
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:49,300
carrying all these tools and not using

77
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:51,339
any of this gave us a chance to you know

78
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:54,339
come up with different ideas on how to

79
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:57,460
get past certain challenges so it's the

80
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:59,080
challenges are points and then you take

81
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:03,549
the points and you subtract the weight

82
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:07,029
of the tools and that's so a lot of

83
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,710
people that and it was a lot of fun and

84
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:12,939
I got a lot of really good feedback on

85
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:17,039
how next time so first place and the

86
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:17,039

93
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,940

94
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:07,800
[Applause]

95
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:39,130
a pair of scissors he went to the gift

96
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:41,979
shop and got a pair of scissors and did

97
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:48,089
so many things and still managed to get

98
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:48,089
about 113 points with a pair of scissors

99
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:54,300
like what was the maximum points maximum

100
00:08:51,520 --> 00:09:06,520
point use about a hundred pieces

101
00:08:54,300 --> 00:09:09,130
included like and that was he also did

102
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,870
amazing and really analyzed the tools

103
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:12,790
and the puzzles and came up with this

104
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:14,980
entire strategy when it was her turn to

105
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:18,579
do the puzzle to do the challenges

106
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:20,860

throw this in here it's a little bit of

115
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:23,660
a shape for closing remarks but I heard

116
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:28,160
some rumors that we might have some

117
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:30,110
people from rather far away so I want to

118

I have an incredible team because they

141
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:52,699

143
00:12:52,699 --> 00:12:56,978

Athena's here and for anybody goes on

147
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:05,809
the CFP review order if you have never

148
00:13:03,859 --> 00:13:08,239
done a CFP review it's a lot of work

149
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:11,929
it's extraordinarily difficult to pick

150
00:13:08,239 --> 00:13:14,239
between really good presentations and we

151
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:15,919
ended up having a huge number of

152
00:13:14,239 --> 00:13:18,019
submission sister which is awesome I

153
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:19,939
love that but it came with the negative

154
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:22,099
of having to reject some people and that

155
00:13:19,939 --> 00:13:24,259
was really hard it was incredibly

156
00:13:22,099 --> 00:13:26,839
challenging to figure out we wanted to

157
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:29,839
see it all we just we can't do it so

158
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:32,299
thank you for submitting thank you for

159
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,849
and then thank you for the review we're

160
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:36,589
also on top of that that's not like so

161
00:13:34,849 --> 00:13:39,529
that's that's good stuff the Jared takes

162
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:42,070
character here and then at calm the poor

163
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:45,880
man wrangle speaker speakers

164
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:47,649
and I don't know if you guys but the the

165
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:55,389
speakers are hard to track down and

166
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:57,790
they're sober okay so either really

167
00:13:55,389 --> 00:13:59,920
crucial thing that we had that's been

168
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:01,209
going on all year is get to the crown

169
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:17,019
process what did you guys think of the

170
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:20,790
Crown Plaza so we really like the Crown

171
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:24,220
Plaza I think we may end up here again

172
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:26,349
so I'm glad to hear that you guys liked

173
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:28,089
it if you have any suggestions for us on

174
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:31,060
anything please let me know send us an

175
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:32,649
email but also if you have a suggestion

176
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,149
specifically for how you'd like to see

177
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:35,800
book then you can figure a little bit

178
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:39,550
differently maybe soft pain point with

179
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:43,300
proudful let us know I was pretty busy

180
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:45,279
putting my hair out whole weekend so one

181
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,079
of the ways that the primary reason that

182
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:50,439
the crown has been such a great venue is

183
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:54,430
because you have Sonia and Marie who

184
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:57,250
have spent countless hours negotiating

185
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:58,719
with the hotel organizing things about a

186
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,670
month ago there was a change of

187
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,410
leadership and so even though the

188
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:04,930
overall contract was in place all of the

189
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:06,939
details and all of the fine precision

190
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:09,399
work was just gone and we started over

191
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:11,470
from scratch to the fact that things

192
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:12,940
went as smoothly as they did is a

193
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:16,380
tribute to how hard they work so

194
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:16,380
laureen's I mean who is me stand up

195
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,939
[Applause]

196
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:40,259
[Applause]

197
00:15:41,499 --> 00:15:56,539
there's tusky so you're pushing stuff to

198
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:59,509
essentially what we consider our

199
00:15:56,539 --> 00:16:01,729
production website and normally and that

200
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:03,589
goes through some sort of middle the

201
00:16:01,729 --> 00:16:05,749
process but II switch that happen you

202
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:12,129
switch over to telepathy so I would

203
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:12,129
think about a change and I would log in

204
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:15,669
there already

205
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:35,829
so for all of the purchase signage and

206
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:38,319
the t-shirts around the conference our

207
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:41,709
lovely back designer Barbie clips in an

208
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:43,059
enormous amount of time and we often

209
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,709
said that she's the soul of conference

210
00:16:43,059 --> 00:16:48,309
because it's the image that everybody

211
00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:51,758
sees so we did some incredibly cool art

212
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:55,659
this year she also got this cool so they

213
00:16:51,759 --> 00:17:00,099
made a photo photo closer and abouts

214
00:16:55,659 --> 00:17:02,699
been more fun than it was pathetic cost

215
00:17:00,099 --> 00:17:02,699
so it was

216
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:31,600
okay so police is our lead and this year

217
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:33,370
we normally we rent the equipment this

218
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,649
year we decided that we wanted to focus

219
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:38,260
on some of the expansion it's we ended

220
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:40,270
up purchasing some portion of our

221
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:43,480
audio-visual equipment which meant that

222
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:45,670
lease had to end it with partially

223
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,010
rented systems and partially own systems

224
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:50,800
and somehow make that work he did an

225
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:53,470
amazing job with very little help

226
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:58,260
and basically no health before calm it

227
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:58,260
was all Elise so thanks to Lisa

228
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:13,970
and then the team team they are high

229
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:16,040
school students that are affiliates of

230
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:18,230
the table and they monitored their time

231
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:20,540
today and yesterday become health and so

232
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:23,600
not only are they incredibly

233
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:24,649
hard-working and fun to hang out with by

234
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,629
hopefully they're getting some

235
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:40,760
real-world skills that they can apply so

236
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:43,340
the chopped and I'm totally springing

237
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:46,450
this honor but does Gloria want to come

238
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:46,449
up and say a couple of words about

239
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:25,319
[Music]

240
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:53,820
okay Hector is our veteran or salute

241
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:56,580
keenly he is he's a better service and

242
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:59,490
he's also a wonderful guy so he

243
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:00,810
organized so we were able to sponsor

244
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,640
tender business you're actually I'm

245
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:06,419
sorry girls sponsored photo evidence

246
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,280
this year because we had the sponsor who

247
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:11,100
was able to purchase two tickets for

248
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:14,460
veterans so that's really awesome we

249
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:16,320
were able to have basically in the final

250
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,740
race be there was a track that talks all

251
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:22,620
salute where it focused on our service

252
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:26,970
members were moving to the extra duty as

253
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:29,070
well yes okay so it's exactly to the

254
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:32,630
Emperor service but it focuses primarily

255
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:35,399
on transmission in the civilian tech so

256
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:37,380
that's that's not something that I see

257
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,980
at any other conference and I think

258
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,840
that's amazing

259
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:42,320
so thank you so much detector for

260
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,320
putting that together

261
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:57,408
okay so first security physical security

262
00:20:53,809 --> 00:21:01,928
and the code of conduct Brett or static

263
00:20:57,409 --> 00:21:04,639
was amazing this year super helpful and

264
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:07,609
very guy came in he meant somewhat

265
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:10,488
last-minute because because we asked him

266
00:21:07,609 --> 00:21:19,210
to please and and he saved us from the

267
00:21:10,489 --> 00:21:19,210
vine so thank you so much

268
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:36,159
okay so for your leads in amongst those

269
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:38,350
made about 65 to 70 toll volunteers

270
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,960
between raisiny hacker village and

271
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:43,570
general volunteers and the people

272
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:46,510
leading those were ana Ana and Victor so

273
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:49,600
they put an enormous amount of effort in

274
00:21:46,510 --> 00:22:22,450
and dealt with the hundreds of emails

275
00:21:49,600 --> 00:22:23,919
that I didn't want to do so we've got we

276
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:25,450
had a big party last night out of the

277
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,880
pool and we're gonna have another big

278
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:28,660

we'll see you there

280
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:33,070
the only reason that that happened is

281
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:36,460
because Sonia came in she told me and

282
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:38,919
she said I'm organizing these events and

283
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:42,280
I said okay and she's done an amazing

284
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:45,820
job she has pulled together on a

285
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:49,000
shoestring budget beautiful decorations

286
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:50,830

someone randomly assigned to a

00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:34,709
lock-picking village I needed some extra

387
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:37,560

388
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:39,690
people will rapidly learn how a lockpick

389
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:42,090
and they both already had instructed a

390
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:44,900
topic abilities so I can't make that up

391
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:44,899
folks that's awesome

392
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:58,230

00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:03,330
worked really closely with

395
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:06,150

398
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:16,199
the centerpieces on the tables I thought

399
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:19,350
that that really brightened up a

400
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:22,350
privilege and it was amazing so that was

401
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:24,060

our community tables we had a bunch of

439
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:05,840
local groups come in and we really

440
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,370

445

446
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:20,390
doesn't matter what comp you go to as

447

449
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:26,539

[Applause]

451
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:44,459
[Applause]

452
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:13,889
the final link that I have is I just

453
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:17,819
want to thank all the attendees came out

454
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:20,220
and made this time possible you know if

455
00:34:17,819 --> 00:34:21,509
if nobody came to the Crom it wouldn't

456
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:23,668
be any fun right I got stuck here in the

457
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:25,109
empty halls with all the cool toys and

458
00:34:23,668 --> 00:34:28,549
all the cool stuff and I would be bored

459
00:34:25,109 --> 00:34:31,230
silly so thank you for being a part of

460
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:32,970
our wonderful community and for making

461
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:35,300
it a great place I really had fun this

462
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:35,299
weekend

463
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:58,740
you are like glazed over

464
00:34:49,109 --> 00:35:00,420
or maybe hungover so just if you want to

465
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:03,720
stay in contact with us follow us on

466
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:05,369
Instagram or Twitter isn't this a

467
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,080
wonderful photo the whole reason for

468
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:12,330
this 5 is so that I can put this photo

469
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:17,069
it ok so what are we doing for the

470
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:20,130
bottom fire into the deep set so the

471
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:22,560
place that we go is 302 beach bonfire

472
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:24,450
pits and it is just down the street

473
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,089
according to this highly effective a map

474
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:28,230
screenshot it's nine minutes away so you

475
00:35:27,089 --> 00:35:31,109
have no excuses

476
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:33,410
7 minutes if you take the weird bendy

477
00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:33,410
place

478
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,239
[Applause]

479
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:59,050
the parking is where you pull in and

480
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:32,500
then you can walk a really short

481
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:35,530
distance and that is for some reason

482
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:37,450
forget all the things that I just said

483
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:39,400
mr. hungover or bored of you talking

484
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:39,790
it's all on the website there's a button

485
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,100
called

486
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:46,120
bonfire babies probably not gonna get

487
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:47,230
now and then it's already up so you

488
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:51,609
don't have to worry about it makes you

489
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:54,400
changing one final note the parking lot

490
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:56,290
is locked at 10:00 so you probably want

491
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:08,410
to enter vehicle how does the parking

492
00:36:56,290 --> 00:37:10,750
lot before that occurs so in the

493
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:13,480
background this year again some pretty

494
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:17,460
major organizational changes Shawn who

495
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:20,320
was a co-founder with Laurie and I moved

496
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:22,300
and he still really wanted to be

497
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,740
involved but light kinda got away and so

498
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,660
it wasn't able to be as heavily involved

499
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:27,459
this year and I needed help so I reached

500
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,799
out to Steve whose birth the courts did

501
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:32,320
last year primarily in an operational

502
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:35,860
role and asked them you willing to come

503
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,920
be my co-director so he's been pretty

504
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:47,320
much documenting all of our processes

505
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:50,320
which had been a nightmare he's slowly

506
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:53,680
ramping up and stepping up in his role

507
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:56,060
at shell pop so I just want to both of

508
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:58,310
him and let you guys know that

509
00:37:56,060 --> 00:38:00,259
any questions that you would direct to

510
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:04,250
me that now you can direct them to speak

511
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:05,540
no wait that that Stephen are people

512
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:08,570
working together to make sure that this

513
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:10,160
table continues to grow and continues to

514
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:31,610
have a level of quality to be sought

515
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:34,129
this year thanks everyone core team feel

516
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:35,510
welcome as one of the team members I

517
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:36,950
just wanted to make kind of a pre

518
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:38,510
comment on the stack of dead so I've

519
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:41,299
been an entrepreneur and a project

520
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:42,950
manager my entire life and so I go team

521
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:46,130
like I it's what I love to do I enjoy it

522
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:48,740
and to this I believe giving the most of

523
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:52,460
the AZT I've ever seen in my entire life

524
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:54,439
like I cannot get over how it's just I

525
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:56,510
mean each individual piece of this

526
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,970
puzzle the person who's running it is

527
00:38:56,510 --> 00:39:02,330
perfect is perfect for their position so

528
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:04,220
I didn't want to be a part of this and I

529
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:05,390
don't know I mean you guys are more

530
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:09,439
perfect community I've got an actual

531
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:12,109
part of the other now this but this

532
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,210
seems and feels a lot different than a

533
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:16,700
lot of other cons and conferences I've

534
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:18,500
been to in other realms and I think what

535
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:21,259
we're building here is really really

536
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:24,250
special and really really important so

537
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:26,630
thank you all thank you all who attend

538
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:29,090

00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:32,260

540
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:32,260
