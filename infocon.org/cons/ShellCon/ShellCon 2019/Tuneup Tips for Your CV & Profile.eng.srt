1
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,450
luckily I gave this in a couple other

2
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:34,599
cons so it's around online if people

3
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:34,599
watch it yeah it's nap time

4
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:45,520
all right so I'll just kick it off so if

5
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,600
anyone wants to like ask questions

6
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,989
there's only a couple of us so you go

7
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,070
for it and my mouse is emerging so I'm

8
00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:55,280
just gonna go this way

9
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:59,390
all right so we're gonna start with the

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,250
intentions you're here you're building

11
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:03,829
your network networking does not need to

12
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,059
be scary a lot of people forget that you

13
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:07,790
actually make friends with some

14
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:11,420
recruiters not all recruiters are

15
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:12,680
terrible and they will move from company

16
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,950
to company and they'll help you find

17
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:18,170
jobs you can use social media you can

18
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:22,250
establish what you know using get lab

19
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:25,250
github blogs and anything that you can

20
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:29,720
do in order to know when jobs become

21
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:31,490
available or when somebody says we're

22
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,780
going to be opening a position the

23
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,250
earlier you can get in the more people

24
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,960
you can talk to in a company the more

25
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:40,430
chance you have of actually getting a

26
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:42,229
role now the resume this is probably

27
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:44,119
actually you care about a lot of people

28
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:45,380
just have one and they send it around

29
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:47,600
everyone and that's usually not

30
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,000
effective what you want to do is have a

31
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,589
master resume that has all your job

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,150
experience everything you've ever done

33
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,439
especially if you're ever gonna apply

34
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,000
government because they're like we need

35
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:57,229
this many years experience and we need

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,080
you to document every single thing you

37
00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:02,630
did in that time period in a specific

38
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,189
format as well then what you can do is

39
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,929
you can take that master one make a copy

40
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:08,750
of it and trim it down for each one of

41
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:10,130
the jobs use their own terms back at

42
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:13,010
them especially important if you're

43
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:15,470
doing government jobs otherwise if they

44
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:17,420
say we want a security analyst or a

45
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,940
threat researcher and your title was

46
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:22,220
analyst 1 or analyst 2 you can kind of

47
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,900
shift that around you can say I was a

48
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,359
analyst 1 performing the

49
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:30,140
responsibilities of a threat researcher

50
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:32,090
if that's legitimate do not lie cover

51
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,529
letters kind of debatable some hiring

52
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,600
managers I talked to you're like I

53
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,130
always read them

54
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,440
the ones who like guys pretty much don't

55
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:40,240
read them work by ATS or applicant

56
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,150
tracking system strips them off which is

57
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:45,010
unfortunate but in my opinion go for it

58
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,990
right them they don't have to be long

59
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,429
they do have to be precise than the job

60
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,990
though and it's a really great

61
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:52,750
opportunity if you have anything weird

62
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:55,450
like I'm shifting positions I took a

63
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,520
year off you can take a chance to say

64
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,140
you know in the past year instead of

65
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,840
working full-time I was taking the

66
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,579
opportunity to work on my home lab and

67
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,110
learn these particular skills so you can

68
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,240
kind of spin it around anything that

69
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:09,850
they might look on the resume like I

70
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,320
wonder what happened here or I wonder

71
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:13,450
why this person news and that psych

72
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:18,600
admin is applying for this position it

73
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:21,489
gives you a chance to kind of spin it so

74
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,049
bottom line up front especially if

75
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:26,110
you're doing career shifting or took a

76
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:28,480
break try to say what it is that you

77
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:30,550
want to be doing so that they're not

78
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,679
trying to guess because sometimes I am

79
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:34,000
hiring for two three four different

80
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,520
positions and I'm scanning through the

81
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,290
resume so when I see at the top I'm a

82
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,120
network engineer and I really want to

83
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,950
have the position on your sock team

84
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,570
because I will be able to analyze all of

85
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,829
your traffic I'm like okay so I'm

86
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:48,100
looking for that role let me look

87
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:50,650
through for those keywords whitespace is

88
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,420
amazing please don't have teeny tiny

89
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,550
eight-point fonts and all scrunched

90
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:57,369
together and use every square inch of

91
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:58,690
the page if you're reading hundreds of

92
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:01,240
resumes a day that was just kind of get

93
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:03,400
overwhelming the one thing I always hear

94
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,260
a lot is it's got to be one page I don't

95
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,940
believe that and a lot of people I talk

96
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,000
to you don't believe it but also don't

97
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:11,710
go crazy if it's over two pages I'm

98
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,810
hoping that somewhere on there is like I

99
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:16,420
worked on putting a rover on the moon

100
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:19,030
and I'm amazing check me out or I've

101
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:22,060
been in this industry for 40 years and I

102
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:23,979
have all of these skills so two pages to

103
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,750
me is perfectly reasonable especially if

104
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:28,090
you aren't giving me good descriptive

105
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:31,350
bullet points let's say what you were

106
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:33,849
responsible for and the scope of it and

107
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,590
daxing yourself a lot of people put

108
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,970
their entire home address personal use

109
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:39,549
until then post it publicly on the

110
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:42,010
internet I don't understand that you

111
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:43,930
don't need to do that if you want put a

112
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,010
city in state but most the time you'll

113
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,380
have to do that when you're applying to

114
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,630
the job anyway so why put your whole

115
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,430
street address

116
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:54,190
the basics these ones you probably

117
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:56,260
already know chronological job history

118
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:59,800
don't make me figure out why everything

119
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:02,920
is not in the same order education

120
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:05,830
there's a cheat for this one do they

121
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:08,560
want college but you didn't finish did

122
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:13,599
you take some college you can actually

123
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:15,190
put in hiatus uh if you know I'm a if it

124
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,980
is a strict requirement that you have to

125
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,760
have completed and degree then that's

126
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,220
not gonna work

127
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,510
but if my company like prefers people

128
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,890
that have gone to college which I've

129
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,630
worked in some places like that and

130
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:27,969
maybe will actually help you pay to

131
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:30,190
finish school and you can't become maybe

132
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:32,080
a certain level within the company

133
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:33,580
without that and you're willing to

134
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,490
finish it you can always just put on

135
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:38,740
hiatus the other trick about education

136
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,120
is if you are at any company and they

137
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,100
will pay for you to get an education

138
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,540
even if you're not like yeah I really

139
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,550
want a bachelor's for no particular

140
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:47,350
reason start taking classes anyway

141
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,690
honestly especially if it's on their

142
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:51,700
dime just one a semester or whatever

143
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:54,640
because having that in case that company

144
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:56,170
folds can be a really amazing trick

145
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,390
don't do it if it's on your own money

146
00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:00,250
but if you can get that for free and it

147
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:02,919
is something relevant to you it's fun to

148
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:05,730
learn and it might save you when you

149
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:08,920
potentially need to look for another job

150
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:11,470
certifications I don't believe that they

151
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:14,290
make you more amazing than another

152
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:17,140
person but it will help you get past the

153
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:20,860
ATS or applicant tracking system it will

154
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:22,690
also help some people say well I know

155
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,820
that you have least heard base

156
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:27,250
terminology you have these particular

157
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:29,110
degrees I know that there's a starting

158
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,270
point at which I don't need to train you

159
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:34,360
whereas somebody else I'm like I don't

160
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:35,650
know what they did at their company and

161
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,660
how much they really let them do or

162
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:39,520
learn so if you can't get a

163
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:42,100
certification especially paid for by

164
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,120
your school or your furn employer go for

165
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,420
it

166
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,370
if you can't get a certificate here's

167
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:54,900
another trick same as education if you

168
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:58,210
can take a study program for PMP cissp

169
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:00,039
ethical hacker whatever it is you can

170
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,568
just put like have done all the study

171
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:08,610
courses for

172
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:11,139
the hacker willing to take the exam if

173
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:13,270
you are actually willing to take the

174
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:15,429
exam because some companies I've had

175
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:17,020
friends get hired and they're like okay

176
00:07:15,429 --> 00:07:19,808
we need you to pass it within six months

177
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,998
to work like terminating like you during

178
00:07:19,809 --> 00:07:23,409
your probationary period if you really

179
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:25,119
have taken all this study and you really

180
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:27,759
are willing to take it but the test is

181
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:30,249
ridiculously expensive why not do that

182
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:35,589
and then when I search your resume for

183
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:39,189
ethical hacker cissp comes up you aren't

184
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:41,110
filtered out for technical skills on

185
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:42,819
that master resume it was referencing

186
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:46,809
earlier that has like all your things

187
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:49,240
put in everything but couple things with

188
00:07:46,809 --> 00:07:52,719
this you want to list which ones that

189
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:55,659
you have used and which ones you're

190
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:57,939
proficient at because maybe you can do

191
00:07:55,659 --> 00:08:00,819
some Python scripting but you're not

192
00:07:57,939 --> 00:08:03,159
gonna be a Python developer make it

193
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:07,149
clear to me so that I know if this stub

194
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:09,639
is super heavy in scene and you're like

195
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:11,649
ah I can sorta mess around the see it's

196
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:13,599
like alright this is not the job for you

197
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:17,979
and at least we're not gonna waste both

198
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:19,329
each other's time on that area that's

199
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:21,128
where you're gonna do a ton of your

200
00:08:19,329 --> 00:08:23,409
trimming if there's not a skill set

201
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:25,509
listed for that job in the job posting

202
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:27,099
feel free to digit but there are some

203
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:29,409
weird jobs that are like yeah we need

204
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:31,719
you know have you used burp suite and

205
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:34,149
Metasploit and you're like okay I can

206
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:35,860
say like have cake classes in or have

207
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:37,360
used in home lab or whatever maybe

208
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,949
haven't used it professionally but at

209
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:46,209
least you can put it there so that it

210
00:08:38,948 --> 00:08:47,229
matches for the job posting all right so

211
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:50,369
here's a couple things that you

212
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:53,529
sometimes forget if you volunteered

213
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:56,920
voluntary choke on voluntary your local

214
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:59,560
meetup group for security people that

215
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:02,219
counts that skills you might need to be

216
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:06,459
a manager have you done volunteer

217
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:07,990
coordination that's managing people now

218
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:09,880
don't say like you did it professionally

219
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:12,490
you can say in a volunteer capability

220
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,139
for six months out of the year depending

221
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,970
on your organization it depends how long

222
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:17,250
the volunteer

223
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:19,800
laughs I do Diana and that one's

224
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:23,190
actually 11 out of 12 months so like I

225
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:26,000
manage you know 100 volunteers or I do

226
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:28,380
project management for this particular

227
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,520
organization or for the local meetup

228
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:34,260
group I do budgeting that's a legitimate

229
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,060
thing if it is a real organization you

230
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,439
really did it you can put down that kind

231
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,900
of stuff and that can help show

232
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,490
especially resumes aren't just gifting

233
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,870
you a new job you can move within the

234
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,940
company you can be like I want to be a

235
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,020
manager of a team of people I want to

236
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,720
show that I know how to be fiscally

237
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:51,600
responsible manage people handle like

238
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,070
sourcing hiring firing volunteer

239
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,450
opportunities are a great way to get

240
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,770
that exposure if your company's not

241
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,000
giving it to you and then you've got to

242
00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:01,020
leverage yourself into a better paying

243
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,770
job competitions and awards and you want

244
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,090
to say to you

245
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:05,010
that's actually pretty amazing

246
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:06,600
especially if you're new in the field it

247
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:08,280
shows that you have a passion for it and

248
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,640
you've got enough skills to win

249
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:14,579
somewhere so list them and then last one

250
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:17,580
is key words whatever manual words show

251
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:20,550
up in the job posting work into your

252
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:24,000
resume because again applicant tracking

253
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:25,439
system I as the first level person who

254
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,690
maybe doesn't actually know the position

255
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,700
very well I'm looking for a threat

256
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:31,500
researcher I'm going to look for the

257
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,020
word threat researcher if you were a

258
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,300
security analyst one you're not gonna

259
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:38,640
show up in my search so say again

260
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:44,180
security analyst one doing threat

261
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:48,390
research again no lying

262
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:50,849
so extras you can do PDF some people are

263
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:53,760
like Rondo do BDS most systems will

264
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:56,370
handle a PDF it's okay on the other hand

265
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,689
watch out for like Microsoft Word if

266
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:00,630
their system doesn't explicitly say

267
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:02,220
we're happy with doc or docx you're

268
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,720
actually probably better off doing a PDF

269
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,950
because if you get mangled and I'm

270
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,640
trying to read you and everything is all

271
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:09,089
over the place

272
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:12,990
I may just honestly move on to the next

273
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:15,150
resume open this to real oh if the job

274
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:17,430
specifically says something about you

275
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:19,829
have to work in the office or we're not

276
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:21,839
gonna pay real oh you could always in

277
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:23,700
your cover letter not the resume say

278
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,710
that you're open to relocation or open

279
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,110
that you're open to travel which could

280
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,800
differentiate you or that you're open to

281
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:31,259
self reload

282
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,628
if you're in the financial ability to do

283
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:35,279
that and so in the cover letter that

284
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:37,199
could give you a heads up because if I'm

285
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,449
looking at someone who's like I want new

286
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:41,729
travel and you know I said it was 20%

287
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:43,679
travel and you're like you know I love

288
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:45,540
traveling and totally willing to do that

289
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:46,799
for your company it's like okay well

290
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:50,040
this person is actually gonna enjoy it

291
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:53,369
so let me get for that all right here's

292
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:55,529
one that I need

293
00:11:53,369 --> 00:11:57,689
honestly I'm terrible at this I hate

294
00:11:55,529 --> 00:12:00,360
self-promoting cuz I'm like okay well I

295
00:11:57,689 --> 00:12:03,089
did this project you and my friends are

296
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,610
like there's nothing of detail and value

297
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,929
in this statement about this project but

298
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:09,389
I don't want to like you know my team

299
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:10,889
did it it's like no you need to take

300
00:12:09,389 --> 00:12:12,179
credit for it so having friend go

301
00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:13,739
through and have them grill you your

302
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:15,629
friends are gonna be better at helping

303
00:12:13,739 --> 00:12:17,999
you in your resume than you are and then

304
00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:19,110
turn it around and help them to because

305
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:21,329
your friends here you bitch about your

306
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:22,949
job right they probably actually can say

307
00:12:21,329 --> 00:12:25,138
like what about that really big thing

308
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:27,449
where you helped with that incident oh I

309
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:28,649
was just you know like helping document

310
00:12:27,449 --> 00:12:32,040
everything whatever you know that's the

311
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:34,799
thing you actually did some work so have

312
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,748
your friends help you um and then

313
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:40,170
something I meant to put on here but I

314
00:12:36,749 --> 00:12:42,029
didn't again a sense of scale I don't

315
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:43,679
know you I don't know your company I

316
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:46,019
don't know what you were doing so if you

317
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:49,160
just tell me I managed to the land

318
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:52,049
sweeper installation at my work

319
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:54,540
hey how many of the installation was

320
00:12:52,049 --> 00:12:57,569
that did you inherit it or did you start

321
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:59,399
that project what was the outcome were

322
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:00,540
you able to identify anything help

323
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:04,639
anything improve anything

324
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:10,790
so anything that you're doing action

325
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:12,839
scale outcome does that make sense

326
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:15,059
there's like otherwise that sentence

327
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:16,499
Alejo and I find everybody can turn on

328
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:18,929
Lansky sweeper for like a hundred

329
00:13:16,499 --> 00:13:21,660
computers oh you did it for like ten

330
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:26,639
thousand computers Wow okay nevermind

331
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:28,829
then uh here's a woodsy one I can't ask

332
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:32,069
you of your US citizen I can't ask you

333
00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:35,099
if you can get a clearance you can hint

334
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:37,559
to me that your clearable or you can get

335
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:41,160
a clearance by saying have had a

336
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:42,689
clearance in the past or you know I'm

337
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,540
ready to get a clearance

338
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:47,640
if having read all the requirements for

339
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:50,160
various levels of clearances you've that

340
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:52,199
is legitimate and you could so you can

341
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,910
hint to me that you are clear Bowl and

342
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,100
this will accelerate you in some

343
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:58,260
consulting organizations and jobs

344
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:00,510
because if they have a lot of federal

345
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:03,510
government agencies that they work for

346
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:05,160
then the consultant that they hire or

347
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,540
the people that they hire to consult for

348
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,439
the government will have to be Clarabel

349
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:11,189
but they can't come out and ask you and

350
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,230
government applications I've actually

351
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:15,690
gotten rejected from a few jobs even

352
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:18,830
though I knew hiring but I do it in the

353
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:21,800
public sector not private there are very

354
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:23,790
precise formats you need to follow and

355
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,069
actually the government requirements

356
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:29,370
that they list them on the job site so

357
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:33,450
for example you're applying to 18f or

358
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:34,920
you're applying to Tech Congress which

359
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:36,750
I've nobody's heard of Tech Congress

360
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:40,290
like they actually hire people for I

361
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:42,630
think it's $80,000 a year for a one-year

362
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:46,199
stint to come advise Congress on not

363
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:48,330
doing dumbass so if that is a thing

364
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:51,180
you're interested in every year they

365
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:52,800
start in January I think this year's

366
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:55,680
already been selective it may be next

367
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,170
year but they will actually have example

368
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,540
resume formats for you to follow so

369
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:02,339
follow those precisely and they really

370
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:06,930
mean it don't get cute

371
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:11,310
alright so LinkedIn I use this very very

372
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:13,859
heavily yes it's spammy yes you get tons

373
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:15,689
of junk mail that you don't want but

374
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:18,570
honestly if you are looking for a job

375
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:21,360
even passively I'm gonna recommend you

376
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:24,030
have LinkedIn I have a specific email

377
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,270
address for it if you want keep it and

378
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:30,089
vagrants you know detailed as you want

379
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:32,100
but as a passive method of getting

380
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:33,930
people to reach out you will get

381
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,910
information you can ignore most of them

382
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:37,469
like I honestly don't take it personally

383
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:40,020
people ignore my messages especially

384
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:42,089
like that I'm assuming they're getting

385
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:44,579
you know ten twenty a day kind of like I

386
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:47,339
do please have your face and a very

387
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:49,650
boring photo I don't want to see you

388
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:51,180
partying I don't want to see like three

389
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:54,140
people all in the picture together and

390
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,880
have to guess who you are

391
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,689
just

392
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,389
if you can't afford a professional

393
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:01,970
headshot like find a blank wall get a

394
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:04,250
friend follow all the tips online of

395
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:07,750
like look slightly past the camera smile

396
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:11,509
so that doesn't mean to be glamorous

397
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:13,759
perfect so yeah get one here include all

398
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:15,350
of your jobs certifications volunteers

399
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,089
board think of this only grow this thing

400
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:19,399
had that master resume have the master

401
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:22,910
resume LinkedIn and then choose how much

402
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:24,709
in detail you want to put in there so if

403
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:27,589
you want to just toss only the buzzwords

404
00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:29,149
and LinkedIn cool that's fine if you can

405
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:33,500
actually put the whole thing that's also

406
00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:35,269
fine um one thing about this is the next

407
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:38,810
screen I think has it

408
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:41,509
oh it's loading all right let me see if

409
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:42,709
I've actually got it on my local drive I

410
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:45,680
don't know how many people have actually

411
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:59,959
seen LinkedIn recruiter from a recruiter

412
00:16:45,680 --> 00:17:01,790
point of view okay so this is why I keep

413
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:03,979
saying the word buzzword over and over

414
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:04,970
and over again when I'm trying to find

415
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,870
you to hire you

416
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:10,760
this is actually what I look at and here

417
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:13,329
I can put in whatever I want for job

418
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:17,209
titles whatever I want for location

419
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:19,099
skills what companies you've worked at i

420
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:23,270
can actually target poaching particular

421
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:25,030
people year of graduation what schools

422
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:27,770
you attended if i wanna go after certain

423
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:29,600
industries I can put keywords in this

424
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:31,340
case I put security analysts what

425
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,590
industry you identify is putting

426
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:36,639
yourself in whether you recently joined

427
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:41,899
LinkedIn what spoken languages you have

428
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:43,370
I mean all sorts of things in fact I can

429
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,530
even put in first name a lot of things

430
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:48,918
which I personally a little bit creepy

431
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:50,750
um like I don't know why I want to

432
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:53,390
target all the bombs in the world but I

433
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:55,880
guess I could if I really wanted to I

434
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:58,010
can look for military veterans

435
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:01,490
I can look current company past company

436
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:03,650
and then somewhere down here that got

437
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:05,360
cut off I can actually indicate whether

438
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:07,340
you say that you're looking for a

439
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,320
full-time job a part-time job or

440
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,730
consulting job so

441
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,490
I'm generally looking for people who are

442
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:16,549
looking for full time but this is

443
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:18,080
exactly why when I search each one of

444
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:20,658
these fields it's only going to look in

445
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,399
that field so when you have skills yes

446
00:18:20,659 --> 00:18:26,799
people sometimes they're like I'm gonna

447
00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:28,969
certify you for Lama or turtles or

448
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,320
whatever so your friends are gonna put

449
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:32,480
in goofy ones in there I don't actually

450
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,889
look at them but some of the other

451
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,899
people on my team are actually gonna put

452
00:18:33,889 --> 00:18:37,279
things in there so do try and have some

453
00:18:35,899 --> 00:18:40,580
of the key terms but you want to be

454
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:41,809
identified in there and like I said you

455
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,610
don't have to put the whole lovey

456
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:45,049
sentences that are in your resume that

457
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,668
you probably rewrite like every six

458
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:48,860
months peak when you apply for a new job

459
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:50,570
just have all the buzz words and then

460
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,979
I'll find you see your picture message

461
00:18:50,570 --> 00:19:05,928
you I won't actually dig through all the

462
00:18:51,980 --> 00:19:09,200
stuff but here alright so if you're

463
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:13,960
actually searching oh I told you have a

464
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:16,070
network Twitter get home get live blog

465
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,350
whatever it is you're gonna go to local

466
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:22,129
meetups reach out to that network and

467
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:24,139
tell them I'm sort of looking you know

468
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:25,908
I'm open to new opportunities you don't

469
00:19:24,139 --> 00:19:29,090
have to be actively looking you could

470
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:31,129
just be interested agencies and

471
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:33,049
headhunters they're not a whole terrible

472
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:36,469
I promise you there are some lovely ones

473
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:39,950
but please only pick one so here's what

474
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:41,960
happens every time somebody comes in

475
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:43,730
from a source sure to me we're paying

476
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,580
anywhere from like ten thousand to like

477
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:51,019
forty thousand dollars potentially for

478
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:52,879
that resume if I interview you and then

479
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:56,000
if I hire you a percentage of your

480
00:19:52,879 --> 00:19:59,990
annual salary for the first year goes to

481
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,029
them don't pay them if they ask you to

482
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:04,220
pay them you don't want to deal with

483
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:05,750
them they are making money from me they

484
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:08,539
should not also be double dipping and

485
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,980
making money from you they should

486
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:11,960
actually want to talk to you and find

487
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,029
out what kind of jobs you want and you

488
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,370
should be working with one particular

489
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:18,529
person if you work with multiple and I

490
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:20,029
see that I have paid money and gotten

491
00:20:18,529 --> 00:20:22,490
your resume twice I'm gonna be pissed

492
00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:23,370
I'm not going to interview you because

493
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,960
you are just

494
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:26,909
scattered shouting it you don't actually

495
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:32,309
want this job and everyone's just

496
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:34,290
throwing this resume happy so it you can

497
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:36,450
like they literally have phone calls

498
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:38,550
with you if they're good they will want

499
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:40,530
to know what your skills are what your

500
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:42,540
experience is they'll help you improve

501
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:44,100
your resume don't let them lie on your

502
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:46,440
resume that they can bulk it up and make

503
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,879
it actually like salesy and and lovely

504
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,590
and then they will try and hunt down

505
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,809
opportunities for you because again if

506
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:55,709
you get hired a percentage of your first

507
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:57,270
year salary goes to that so events

508
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:59,190
there's things like this

509
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:02,720
there's job fairs there's job fairs

510
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:02,720
speed dating which is kind of creepy

511
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:31,380
representing here when I looked for jobs

512
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,670
I picked a agency now there's lots of

513
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:36,480
people in that agency but I pick

514
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:38,460
literally one agency and I talk with

515
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,440
that agency and then I pick one

516
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,720
headhunting group and I work with that

517
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,580
headhunting group but I don't go to two

518
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,950
different agencies and two different

519
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:58,620
headhunting groups and it has worked out

520
00:21:46,950 --> 00:22:00,570
for me so I actually uh if they're

521
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,459
pretty decent you can say hey I'm

522
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:04,350
interested in having a conversation with

523
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,970
you I don't want to send over my full

524
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:07,649
resume I will send them a scaled-down

525
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:11,070

526
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:14,400
minimal eyes CV that would not get you a

527
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:15,899
job anywhere take that middle of my CV

528
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,730

529
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:20,190

00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:29,428

537
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,770
partial remote work how successful have

538
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,820
you been with that they should be

539
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:39,158
willing to have like a 1520 maybe

540
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:42,549
30 minute call free with you for free

541
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:44,200

have done and what you're looking for

543
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,139
and if they're not willing to have a

544
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,610
conversation with you

545
00:22:47,139 --> 00:22:49,990
that's your first indicator that they

546
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,490
suck if they're willing down there

547
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:53,620
conversation with you and you send over

548
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:55,720
the resume and they're willing to kind

549
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,918
of talk through it again with you or at

550
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,990
least go back and forth and email

551
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:00,549
they're probably pretty decent if they

552
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:02,289
answered all those questions like hey

553
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:04,240
how many people do you tend to place on

554
00:23:02,289 --> 00:23:07,480
average what average salary for my role

555
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:10,750
do you tend to place I would roll with

556
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,759
them and give them a timeframe say I'm

557
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:15,519
gonna work with you for the next six

558
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:17,320
months nine months and then he like you

559
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:19,059
didn't find me anything I you are no

560
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:21,610
longer representing me please do not and

561
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:23,110
like put it in writing please don't send

562
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:26,500
my resume on anymore you're not

563
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:29,590
representing me anymore and then if they

564
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:32,169
do do that and you catch them you can

565
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:33,340
actually get them for that because you

566
00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:36,490
have specifically told them you do not

567
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:38,470
the right to my data anyone but so you

568
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:40,149
can have a head honey agency that has

569
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:41,860
multiple humans in it and you can talk

570
00:23:40,149 --> 00:23:45,070
to lots of people about agency you can

571
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:47,408
have a recruiting agency and talk to

572
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:50,110
them you can dunk as many sources as you

573
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:52,000
want sorcerers are kind of they only

574
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:53,830
make money if you're paid they don't

575
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,940
make money when they send a qualified

576
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:58,840
resume that's kind of the difference and

577
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:01,059
I know that's kind of weird

578
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:03,129
sorcerers don't get paid to hand me a

579
00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:05,620
resume they'll hand me a ton of resumes

580
00:24:03,129 --> 00:24:07,570
and hope that one works out whereas like

581
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:10,449
headhunters if I'm looking for a c-level

582
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:13,389
or a director or VP may literally get

583
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:20,379
paid to hand me a resume whether or not

584
00:24:13,389 --> 00:24:22,209
I hire you oh yeah sorcerer's work with

585
00:24:20,379 --> 00:24:24,129
as many sources as you want till the

586
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:26,620
cows come home all of them because

587
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:32,080
they're just handing them out to anyone

588
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:33,908
they think might hire you they will

589
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,860
literally they sound exactly like an

590
00:24:33,909 --> 00:24:39,190
agency but they tend to work for C

591
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:41,559
levels and so how ahead and you can like

592
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:43,750
ask them like hey what companies you

593
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:47,428
work with and how do you work and when

594
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:50,110
they say companies come to us to fill a

595
00:24:47,429 --> 00:24:53,040
Pacific position that's more

596
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:55,928
a headhunting agency than a regular

597
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:57,790
agency regular agencies work with a

598
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:59,110
variety of companies on all of their

599
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,940
roles so you can be like you know what

600
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,809
type of roles you fill and if they're

601
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:03,370
like oh we fill

602
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:05,860
regular engineers all the way up through

603
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:08,770
the c-level it's an agency if they're

604
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:10,149
like oh we tend to fill VP director C so

605
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:13,150
that's gonna be more of a headhunter

606
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:16,650
group because I literally go to them and

607
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:18,820
I'm like I need you to find me a C so go

608
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:21,190
and they'll dude like speed-date

609
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:34,570
swarming and then hunt down people and

610
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:37,540
bring them in a headhunter would not go

611
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:39,610
for level ones that would be your

612
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:43,780
agency's might and your sorcerer's

613
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:47,469
definitely will so but yeah so

614
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:49,000
sorcerer's and many dime-a-dozen fire

615
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:54,340
out your resume dog as many of them as

616
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,080
you please so but yeah speed dating is

617
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:58,780
kind of awkward but it can be super

618
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:03,399
effective hiring happy hours and that's

619
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:08,160
like that and I think I'm now over time

620
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:08,160
is the next speaker here oh I will stop

621
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:13,240
so the everybody probably knows all of

622
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,559
these except for possibly states are

623
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,080
required to have an employment list

624
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,850
where all agencies within the state have

625
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,470
to list you may want to take advantage

626
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:25,209
of that in addition to the regular

627
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:27,400
listing boards and then kind of my last

628
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:31,990
point is you're allowed to follow up on

629
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:33,870
people so if you put it in a resume

630
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:37,030
somewhere and you haven't heard anything

631
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:39,040
start using your OSN skills go on

632
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:42,190
LinkedIn go on Twitter go everywhere and

633
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:44,470
be like you know hey and not I feel like

634
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:46,330
one week like wait two weeks be like hey

635
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:48,280
you know two weeks ago a plot I applied

636
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:49,809
I haven't heard anything at all could

637
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,610
you check you know that I'm in the

638
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:53,399
system or could you tell me if that

639
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:55,479
positions been filled

640
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,770
that person may not be able to get you

641
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,820
the answer but they should try and at

642
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:59,230
least get you the answer if I get

643
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,730
reached out to on LinkedIn even if it's

644
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:04,780
not my department I'll go find out that

645
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:06,340
answer for someone so it's not now if

646
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:08,440
you keep asking them over and over again

647
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:11,168
then you're creepy but if you just go

648
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:15,370
through maybe find the email of you know

649
00:27:11,169 --> 00:27:17,530
their HR people internally or LinkedIn

650
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:18,879
or you use social media or your own

651
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:21,129
personal network to find out if the

652
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:24,520
roles been filled that's totally fine

653
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:27,010
ask once via one method if not trying to
