00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:19,859
hi thank you so much for shake up

2
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:25,109
hangover II coming out a little bit

3
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:29,609
earlier so I'm super excited or burning

4
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:32,340
you know so several months ago when we

5
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:39,180
were first under CFP standing that sends

6
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:40,970
in his proposal and be portrayed like I

7
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,260
was like okay this sounds like a regular

8
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:45,260
[Music]

00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,260
description

10
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:55,460
what's that

11
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,849
so without further ado sandy camp

12
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,849
everyone

13
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:19,369
and I watch your project I've been

14
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:22,130
working on so this is the first time

15
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:25,760
I'll be talking about opens great

16
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:29,270
instance that are supposed to be fun so

17
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:36,470
this is called NASA tank and it's a it's

18
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:39,080
a update from earlier urgent from 2002

19
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:40,789
written proof of concept effective first

20
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,369
let's just talk about that in general

21
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:45,590
that is network address translation

22
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:47,990
so we're old when most of us are gonna

23
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:51,020
be familiar with that we have a router

24
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:53,300
at home that is on a network that can to

25
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:59,509
multiple devices come around your

26
00:01:53,300 --> 00:02:07,520
network to Letarte like this now what is

27
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:08,929
the neck so an app is a device so when

28
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,959
that's basically device that allows to

29
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:13,940
have multiple devices on network use a

30
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:15,080
single public IP drums so you may have

31
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:26,720
heard that we're running out of ipv4

32
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:28,519
space and that I totally but until then

33
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,950
we used to have all of our devices

34
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:32,390
public IP address space so when you

35
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:34,488
would connect your DSL or cable modem

36
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:36,470
really that's just a public IP address

37
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:38,720
that is accessible from anyone else

38
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:40,100
across the internet then router

39
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,690
manufacturers basic

40
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,609
progress came out when they had network

41
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:45,709
address translation firewalls have just

42
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:48,230
above where they will have eternal

43
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:50,720
subnet so even have a devices on top and

44
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:53,359
those elect me from IDs like ten dogs

45
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,859
you're about 0.1 or 190 ones it's a

46
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,090
viewer done whatever and those are only

47
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:00,620
accessible within your and then they'll

48
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:04,570
need your router and your router will

49
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,570
then translate that to the public IP

50
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,739
that's the router and in many cases a

51
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:11,420
router will also beautifier wall so in

52
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:14,239
reality the rat watching protects you

53
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,599
from hook ingress so if someone is

54
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,180
trying to

55
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,040
- device under machine they will be able

56
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,930
to be survivors and walk it unless we

57
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:26,760
explicitly set up port forwarding DMC

58
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:28,709
etc and another thing - uh what know

59
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,749
what that thing is the goal of Nappanee

60
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:32,459
is to bypass your net

61
00:03:30,749 --> 00:03:35,040
so as an attacker I've moved higher

62
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:38,040
English it's a lot of fun people to

63
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,810
attack things and I want to bypass

64
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,010
someone else's net so you haven't had an

65
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,579
open you have some devices on your

66
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,689
network

67
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:44,849
why can't you be able to access through

68
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:47,310
devices as if they want behind a

69
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,790
networking party and why is this

70
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,069
interesting

71
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:53,638
well this is a fella so a valve above my

72
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:55,099
computer I have something like 28 or 30

73
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:57,180
services they're just listening and

74
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:58,980
anything most of these are actually on

75
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,599
the public in space so that means if

76
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,578
you're on the same network as me

77
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:04,918
you can talk to all these device oldest

78
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:07,199
obligation so some of us I'm going to

79
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:09,150
eat your sucks I don't even have Soto's

80
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:09,989
but I have a son was happily 18 that's

81
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,000
running on my computer

82
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:14,189
24/7 I didn't even know that until I did

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,320
this until I reported this Cosmo output

84
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:18,509
I hit like fun bunch of random note

85
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,759
clients these aren't no J's things right

86
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:23,449
running parallels parallels is just

87
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:26,009
listening or whatever because the

88
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:27,780
Spotify so you to Spotify but that means

89
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:29,520
it's listening public so anyone can even

90
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,409
connect to Spotify on two different

91
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,750
words it's listening so who knows what

92
00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:35,280
those are that breaks there are going to

93
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,500
be so many vulnerabilities there are

94
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,198
action over both execution stuff that

95
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:43,710
key not just this year now normally you

96
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:45,949
are protected from the public by your

97
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,948
neck

98
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,260
but we nothing works this they also make

99
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,760
gold if we want the victim let's say you

100
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:57,090
picked a machine to visit a website

101
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:59,070
because that's pretty easy to do and

102
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:00,570
that's maybe it looks like that maybe

103
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,760
not malicious website but we have

104
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:04,650
malicious Allen right you just

105
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:07,560
facebooking and get some JavaScript

106
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:09,690
running that is just as good as getting

107
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,880
them to if it was malicious website so

108
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:13,500
let's see how we can do that but let's

109
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,930
understand let's learn a little bit more

110
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:19,290
about that and how it actually tracks

111
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:21,420
connections so that Excel will look at

112
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:23,070
this is an IP header in the TCP header

113
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,840
of a TCP back let's say you're

114
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,969
connecting to a web server on port or

115
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,710
4-3 or maybe you're going to send these

116
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,120
IP packets out and you're gonna have a

117
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,830
source address which will be your

118
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,080
internal IP address like and not fear of

119
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:37,289
drug to a destination which is where the

120
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,000
Google comm that have the source and

121
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,260
destination party and those will be

122
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,650
tracked by the net

123
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:45,780
let's see the video here you might it

124
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:47,729
might be difficult to see food I eat but

125
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,320
essentially on the top I'm sticking from

126
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:51,750
my local machine and from the bottom I'm

127
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,790
sipping from the remote machine and here

128
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:57,500
basically we can see that my internal IP

129
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:59,550
and off by about what's up my name is

130
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,640
connecting out if you are one of four

131
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:05,010
public I repeat but on the blog machine

132
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,140
it doesn't see the ten dot it's either

133
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:09,390
207 not which is a public enemy so

134
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:11,789
that's the conversion of the current now

135
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:13,409
if there's something in that that we see

136
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,850
that's pretty interesting as the

137
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:17,100
progress came out we started to do

138
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:19,950
things like which I could use things

139
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:22,050
like that Kiki and FTP to stop working

140
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:23,789
as those people install it in that and

141
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,740
the reason is FTP

142
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,300
uses multiple reports so if you're

143
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,860
having some where you'll connect of

144
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:33,170
course when you want hopefully your on

145
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:35,730
everything but if you were if you were

146
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:38,040
you connected a 20-watt

147
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:41,280
on some machine and you would say this

148
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:44,190
is a real example something like that

149
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,869
and you say important you said important

150
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:48,540
command and the port command says eight

151
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:50,640
connect back to me on this IP important

152
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,950
and we are empty be client opens the

153
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,570
second important and it's now waiting

154
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:56,130
for a connection to come back so when

155
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:57,870
you say a list I want to list all the

156
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,889
files that's on happening over that

157
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:02,289
she's over that it can be special

158
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:04,719
second connection and what's really cool

159
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:05,469
is that this is a non-conventional not

160
00:07:04,719 --> 00:07:07,900
out of contention

161
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:09,550
so your computer your machine is now

162
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,799
hoping they'll to support once you agree

163
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:13,449
and it says hey if you P server just

164
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,430
back back to one two three

165
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:18,219
now as soon as you're going to nap that

166
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,900
phrase just software so what didn't that

167
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:20,740
vendors do it without our vendors do is

168
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,628
they invented something called

169
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:25,689
application level gateway for Al cheeks

170
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:28,300
and what these do is they write

171
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:29,860
basically inspection so they were

172
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,469
actually now looking at maybe oh you

173
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:34,449
know what I know were 21 TCP is actually

174
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:36,969
typically used for FTP so if I'm going

175
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:39,099
to watch the commands and I scale or

176
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:41,139
command gets sent out and it says hey

177
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:43,449
like that mean on or what you read I

178
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:45,939
think owes report forward one two three

179
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:48,969
back to this person when I see that

180
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:52,750
circumvent so we can use this to

181
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:54,939
actually to actually connect through

182
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:57,490
someone's land even if they're not maybe

183
00:07:54,939 --> 00:08:00,819
doing enough to be now what I'm trying

184
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:02,169
to learn I mean a lot of this stuff may

185
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:04,000
be basically to some people but I'm just

186
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:05,740
going to go over something that I used

187
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,810
to learn so time with reading guard sees

188
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,759
our how something works if it's a

189
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:11,379
protocol well-defined protocol that

190
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,000
nobody in part C on it so you can always

191
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:19,839
to check those out you can see how the

192
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:21,009
port command up to P for example now you

193
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:24,520
know the 10 I started playing with this

194
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:26,259
idea I found that they sort of groups of

195
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,089
restricting points I basically had a

196
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:29,439
curtain thank you for deep and then

197
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:31,810
there was an update to do like these

198
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:33,729
Firefox or Chrome ladies but the editor

199
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,899
for the description list because I was

200
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:38,740
thinking of getting you get to use the

201
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:41,198
web browser to do an HTTP POST and send

202
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:42,810
FTP commands on quickly we want and

203
00:08:41,198 --> 00:08:45,760
until those commands being the positive

204
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:47,380
the problem was the browser's then

205
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,880
started walking port so here's actually

206
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:52,180
source code from prom who needs to dip

207
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:55,899
watch important anyone around that time

208
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:57,969
isn't playing around and listen thinking

209
00:08:55,899 --> 00:08:59,560
okay we'll see some keyboards or sixteen

210
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,480
minutes so this is a five thousand five

211
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,829
ninety different possibilities what is

212
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,850
gonna give important that is larger than

213
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:06,250
sixteen minutes

214
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:10,310
what'll happen and essentially what will

215
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:13,880
happen is in many cases it will overflow

216
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:17,209
we only 11 16 bits so what if you create

217
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:19,400
a form an HTTP form and you send it to

218
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:22,310
not a 16-bit address but a 17th of

219
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:24,020
engines and that 17 bits is the port you

220
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:28,729
want in this example six six six seven

221
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:32,569
which is IRC +65536 which is just a one

222
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:34,580
date in the 17th well what happens is

223
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:37,190
that you're going to see example like if

224
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:39,680
we take port in step 2 6 5 5 3 6 + 137

225
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:41,060
and then we printed we did 1 through 7

226
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,449
and assuming we only have 16 bits of

227
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:46,910
space so that extra bit of data gets

228
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:49,160
dropped so when the here browser is

229
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:51,650
looking at the screen in your form and

230
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,420
says oh this huge about her large and 16

231
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:55,459
bits isn't in my restricted port list

232
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:58,099
and then this says it'll block the TCP

233
00:09:55,460 --> 00:10:00,050
stack which is in live scene and not

234
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,060
only has 16 bits of space he now drops

235
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,800
that extra bit and you just bypass the

236
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:08,529
restriction within the browser now I'm

237
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,529
connected so that's pretty cool

238
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:19,760
here's an example of IRC I received she

239
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:22,729
what I ended up using really like I

240
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,740
receive so here is I just selected any

241
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:26,570
green what I will send to an IRC server

242
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,490
of our connect name you have your

243
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:29,810
username you have your nickname I said

244
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:32,630
my dick name and I said they're quite a

245
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:34,849
message not a big deal now what's

246
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:37,010
interesting about I receive my selected

247
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,870
IRC as an example is because it's very

248
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:41,330
similar to HTTP when the fact that it's

249
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:43,850
a new line are mutable right many

250
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:47,690
protocols are binary but HTTP is

251
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:52,130
coordinating oculus an IRC of a new line

252
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:53,240
based text based protocols so when

253
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:55,010
you're making committee should be

254
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,589
serving for 80 and you say you can get

255
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:59,810
/h would be 1.0 of us whatever that will

256
00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:01,130
give every command phone me long and

257
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:04,219
what's cool about that is a new book

258
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:06,350
post you say post and then some headers

259
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:09,470
and then you can scroll the content of

260
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:11,930
that David so if your application level

261
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:14,089
gateway is now looking at this and says

262
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:17,300
oh I hear there's your mail guitars and

263
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:20,660
I see ok I see oh I get the great a

264
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:23,670
forum we can create a forum in

265
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:26,930
JavaScript generated added

266
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:28,199
Paige lue Linden and that to our report

267
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:30,060
7203

268
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,190
which again is overflowed by our IP

269
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:34,739
staff in terms of two six six and seven

270
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:36,870
this is one ecstasy to the seventh your

271
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,270
ALG on your router to the season higher

272
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:42,180
state measures even though your browser

273
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:44,069
is so now you confuse the router

274
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,229
but isn't no there's no idea that your

275
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:48,600
browsers to be getting x86 and so in

276
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:51,720
this instance IRC and you now control

277
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,400
this post either within the content of

278
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,150
the track which is really gold or

279
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,880
whatever you want

280
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:58,980
and please looking why my line and your

281
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,270
brother's like okay po / I don't want

282
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,860
that means I don't know that my reseach

283
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:04,260
remember thinking I'm going to ignore it

284
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,490
post post polling whatever

285
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,470
I don't know that line I'm going to

286
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:09,630
ignore it and then it gets to go to the

287
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:11,670
content and it's like okay I have this

288
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:13,770
post effects data that's like IRC

289
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:17,880
driving little cool thing about IRC is

290
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:19,740
using the DCC chat or a t65 and TCC

291
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,960
words just like community where you're

292
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:25,470
opening a port on your computer and

293
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:27,000
you're really great power is very

294
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:29,180
beneficial and very helpful in here it

295
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,710
says oh they're trying to open port 22

296
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:35,099
and therefore that back to the user

297
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:36,990
now I was trying to do this the only

298
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,000
thing is the very first line you'll see

299
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:42,960
the way DCC works as you see by a

300
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,750
message you turn a DCC chat my name I

301
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,980
addressed before now what what's goals

302
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,510
we've defined important which means we

303
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,240
can select any port we want a corkboard

304
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:52,439
but we had to know by now when I was

305
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,940
writing this I was just using that users

306
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:57,630
public ID trips because I can get that

307
00:12:53,940 --> 00:13:00,300
problem but that wasn't working and

308
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:02,040
that's I realize because the routers

309
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,650
doesn't be looking from an internal Anki

310
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:07,439
so how did the each my IP address from a

311
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:08,310
browser in 2010 there was something

312
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:14,880
called my limits

313
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:15,689
is anyone heard of body connected in

314
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,000
JavaScript

315
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:19,440
well this it was in Firefox for like two

316
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:25,080
months before they realized this was a

317
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:27,260
good idea but during that time I got to

318
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,260
use it

319
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,370
so here's my deck code so essentially

320
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:34,250
direct people to actually use Java

321
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:38,450
classes factories whatever they are and

322
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:40,550
then to get them blind leads because

323
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:42,530
then you can pull you can actually get a

324
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:44,449
local address you can find the socket

325
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:46,730
and then ask there's two table factory

326
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:48,290
using my little eye business you now

327
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:50,330
have the internal IP address of the user

328
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:52,550
right browsers normally don't reveal

329
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:55,790
that information now you can take that

330
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:58,849
and you know you can take that update

331
00:13:55,790 --> 00:14:00,500
the five FS of the GCC chat and now the

332
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:03,560
rounds like oh this is a totally

333
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:06,080
legitimate DCC chat I better put forward

334
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,550
reports me to or whatever another port

335
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,380
and in your post day that you don't need

336
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:11,209
to do one courtly and inside multiple

337
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:13,310
VCC chimes because then sixty five

338
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:14,780
thousand fifty CC times if you want will

339
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:17,410
be every single quarter back to the

340
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:20,930
victim just by them visiting a website

341
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:23,990
now unfortunately no that was 2010 so

342
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:28,459
life connection no longer exists it was

343
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:30,860
with their God and they fix the overflow

344
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:32,690
teaching guide to me whoever loathing so

345
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,320
I was kind of playing with this recently

346
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:35,030
Montgomery

347
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,040
are there other other look mechanisms

348
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:39,620
that we need use so I went through the

349
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,270
clinic's netfilter infiltrated Linux is

350
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:44,110
my key snack and it was great because

351
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:46,880
the open source you can see politics

352
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:48,800
and the first thing I did doesn't I made

353
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,240
it to this spreadsheet and this protein

354
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:54,550
is all the application of gateways

355
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:57,140
including supports so it has sip FTP IRC

356
00:14:54,550 --> 00:15:00,829
so stuff I never heard of like sustain I

357
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:03,260
think it's a backup service Amanda and

358
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:05,720
some other white stuff like HTTP three

359
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:07,250
and then I went to to chrome source code

360
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,900
and I saw okay what are those reports

361
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:11,630
that our students you can't get out port

362
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:14,569
evasion technique there are many ones

363
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:17,570
that aren't blocked we're saying again

364
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:22,730
never the ER that sit which is to be

365
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:24,790
tzitzit and BabyTV only one of these

366
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:27,680
three three recall such as voice over IP

367
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:29,569
so we're looking at what rome doesn't

368
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,130
block so and thats it was pretty good to

369
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:33,140
this if it isn't pretty common that's a

370
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:37,280
voice over IP protocol virtually every

371
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:39,610
IP Constance it and sieve is they say

372
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:42,620
like FTP

373
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:44,900
so it would sit a nice thing about SIF

374
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:47,810
and Doris pendant to st. is because the

375
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:49,760
SIP is also a B you like basic vertical

376
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:51,500
the benefit here is that the router can

377
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,569
ignore the life of you don't know and

378
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:56,780
we'll look at the line that doesn't for

379
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:59,420
example in the middle of your post so I

380
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:02,300
attempted to do the same thing I ran

381
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:04,880
into decision and the zip also be nine

382
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:08,569
pages you need to include your ideas so

383
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,980
this wasn't working so late okay maybe

384
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:11,120
we can use them they a night to

385
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,370
discovery some other way

386
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,010
I started looking at little features in

387
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:18,500
the browser we'll go over some of that

388
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:19,939
in a bit but basically I'm going in

389
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,340
chrome either like prone colon slash

390
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:25,160
slash actually learn whole instrumental

391
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:26,390
features although the w3 use website and

392
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,100
look into some new standard they're

393
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:30,530
coming out rather simpler the words and

394
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:33,980
do things that are available and I'm on

395
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:36,589
web RTC are these pretty cool sort of

396
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,790
peer-to-peer audio and video and in

397
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:40,160
order to do peers of your audio and

398
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:42,380
video is pretty easy it's over we've

399
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,880
been participating some public IP but if

400
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,250
you're doing Intermountain Atlantic we

401
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:49,310
need to know the IP address the internal

402
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:52,550
business so for that mechanism

403
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:54,829
they'd introduce ice and I support stun

404
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:57,170
and turn and technically it support some

405
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:59,030
other stuff but some intern is actually

406
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:01,400
determine what type of NAT you're behind

407
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:03,350
so you will your browser can now has

408
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,270
stability with WebRTC to connect to

409
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:07,370
acidotic turn server and it says hey

410
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:11,270
you're on this type of event and also

411
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:12,829
here is your public IP address to me to

412
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,970
make one versus work in Charlie on the

413
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:16,550
network you will actually connect

414
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:18,980
directly to look like idiots so the

415
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:21,109
browser now gives you a local IP address

416
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,520
so this is pretty exciting that

417
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:23,599
basically makes its attack work all over

418
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,609
it

419
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:28,490
this was super exciting until I was

420
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:32,030
making a presentation last night and it

421
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:33,670
was working that's why I refreshed and

422
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:38,990
I'm like I took a screenshot and

423
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:40,610
apparently they just fixed this so now

424
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:42,620
the browsers don't give you an internal

425
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:44,479
IP address instead they use font or a

426
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:46,699
DNS and they generate they've got a

427
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,500
local address which only works on your

428
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,730
network so why don't you don't know the

429
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,500
looks like your dress anymore

430
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:55,490
it's tell you goodness like weird

431
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:57,500
hex hexadecimal but if you uie legate

432
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:58,539
they docto and that's only accessible

433
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:28,880
within your network

434
00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:30,799
this sucks so here something on the top

435
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,860
I am just doing a speed up of two

436
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:35,389
different ways why he wants to take

437
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:38,030
throughout two and yet it's not like you

438
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:41,840
creepy doc to exists dollars you free

439
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:43,850
does not exist and I couldn't happen so

440
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,370
I do netcat I'm got to to a word that

441
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:48,439
isn't open and that's 79 and immediately

442
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:50,059
it says connection with the way the

443
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:53,270
ability connection is refused is that

444
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:55,428
TCP lets you have all the artists to go

445
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:56,960
reset and that's how I can connect

446
00:18:55,429 --> 00:18:59,030
somewhere and sent immediately know

447
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,669
there's nothing open Thomas however what

448
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:02,809
that means is they were supposed to do

449
00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:04,820
now what the court is hoping like on

450
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:07,220
port 80 which I also did then you get

451
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:09,230
into guitars team gets in that and that

452
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:12,260
is to start this up to a three week

453
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:14,780
engine what is interesting about those

454
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:16,730
two is that they reach my feet but when

455
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,960
you hit a dog one two three what was

456
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,940
happening is you send a bunch of our

457
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,429
requests for a host and nothing gets

458
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:24,950
responded so isn't times I've heard

459
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:27,140
whatever your local fine artists so what

460
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:30,289
I'm going to get abused that from the

461
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:32,659
browser what if we create an image and

462
00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:37,010
we sent an image to just a random IP

463
00:19:32,659 --> 00:19:40,190
address for now exists let's say fine

464
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:43,010
your network it will return essentially

465
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:45,380
and you add event handlers all on air

466
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:47,240
and on success it will either area

467
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:49,429
because that where it's not okay but the

468
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,590
height she teams up or it will succeed

469
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:55,070
because or is open from the machine is

470
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:57,230
up or it won't air until and seconds

471
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:59,330
later but to garrison heatedly that

472
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:02,419
means it exists so literally just take

473
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:04,480
the top one the top most common gateway

474
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:07,360
of IP addresses like kind of zeros

475
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,880
Monty was about block and then do that

476
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:13,030
for the there is a 256 movies that are

477
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:14,500
common there for everyone and he's say

478
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:16,660
in this code right here we generate an

479
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,160
image of dog script it's just plain HTTP

480
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:20,650
colon slash slash in this case when I to

481
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,000
ones dignity requirements and then

482
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,110
extend it to a kitten kitten so you

483
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,720
don't see this image it's not a real

484
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:28,299
good and we have too many others on air

485
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:30,460
and unload and all those do if they time

486
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:32,650
they say how long did it take to either

487
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:36,130
succeed or every it's less than one

488
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:39,549
second you know this post exists so it

489
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:41,620
wants for 250 and 300 coasts and in one

490
00:20:39,549 --> 00:20:43,710
second you now know oh this kid wait

491
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:46,750
exists why not to wants figure out one

492
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:47,710
10.00 I want does noises so now I know

493
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,650
what the Kingman's

494
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:53,830
didn't repeat this for all 250 States

495
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:55,540
biotic ease on that something and you're

496
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:57,189
gonna get a bunch of posts but was

497
00:20:55,540 --> 00:21:00,129
really nice if you have microsecond

498
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:02,710
precision in JavaScript you see what

499
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:05,169
what respond communities that's going to

500
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:17,169
be your computer your computer is really

501
00:21:05,169 --> 00:21:20,650
fast so here's the example where it was

502
00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:23,740
trying to create web RTC which fails and

503
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:26,890
then I have the local subnet code and

504
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:33,750
basically it's easy thought 107 as a

505
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:37,179
spawn of the fastest and now you see

506
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:39,940
seven is my goodness so we now have

507
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:41,380
modern so here's the actual sit back and

508
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,970
updated right so we kind of go through

509
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:44,230
that you determine the local I hid right

510
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,090
and now you did some the correct IP

511
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:48,640
address a little I take you to the syn

512
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:49,090
packet and let the router alg to all

513
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,110
runs

514
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:53,709
said it's not working and okay I don't

515
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:58,510
know why

516
00:21:53,710 --> 00:22:00,669
so next was a figure out well daily I

517
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:03,460
would switch back to IRC which is

518
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:05,500
succeeded for me ten years ago long as

519
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:07,419
higher states block right we need to

520
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:10,840
find something that from and Firefox and

521
00:22:07,419 --> 00:22:11,890
Safari ie met lump and 5060 was

522
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,379
basically what we wanted a little

523
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:17,669
further impossible so how do we

524
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,669
understand our router works

525
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:26,590
or unless you're not really actually

526
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:27,580
works so we'll go quickly I'm just going

527
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:29,500
to go through some of those tools that

528
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:32,110
they like to use there's lots of other

529
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:36,010
talks and you know we only have so much

530
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:38,469
time so one thing I use a lot is it

531
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:40,360
actually my phone and so the nice thing

532
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:42,100
about the phone is it allows you to see

533
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,479
things really well because you can soon

534
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,980
bring in the nightmare time and that

535
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,940
this is super useful especially when

536
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,920
you're trying to look in circuits

537
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:50,890
nothing is super useful like your phone

538
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:52,540
is that it has a light so if you would

539
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:54,100
enable your flashlight include a very

540
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:56,260
start recording you can then see traces

541
00:22:54,100 --> 00:23:00,520
it's very useful for seeing where traces

542
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:02,890
go and when you look at a piece to eat

543
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,480
if you know nothing if I need enough

544
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:06,310
about circuits or electronics couple

545
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,960
years ago so it's just just by like

546
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:09,310
opening things up and starting to look

547
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,270
at them today learning more and more

548
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:14,440
because they're trying to understand how

549
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:15,940
and when you start looking at chips than

550
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,380
you look at the names you can google

551
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,210
those names and often with my

552
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:21,670
motivations so you can download all the

553
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:22,120
data changes and legend works micro

554
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,650
roads

555
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,270
these are super useful so these are the

556
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:27,850
little tiny probes that you grab onto a

557
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:30,370
million tiny hitch and on chips

558
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:32,350
this is usable for kind of primary and

559
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:37,149
wanting grab on to a couple of minutes

560
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:41,050
on some ships this should be vehicles

561
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:43,860
five images so this watch you can change

562
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:46,570
the firmware for a router for example

563
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:49,000
logic analyzer LEDs use a logic analyzer

564
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:51,639
just I want to give you guys the basic

565
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,190
tools that I use that will allow you to

566
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:57,940
extract your America from devices like

567
00:23:54,190 --> 00:24:00,490
products and for glitching I will be

568
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:03,640
doing the talking a month or two on

569
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:06,190
glitching using really low cost FPGA so

570
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,750
that's pretty cool but there is another

571
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:10,300
fool called a chick whisperer which is

572
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:11,800
meeting an amazing device you can

573
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:14,610
project is the second source working

574
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:16,960
hardware device for

575
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:19,179
glitching attacks you can do all sorts

576
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:23,290
and click extract ideas these devices by

577
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:25,840
doing some color analysis protection so

578
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:26,960
there's a really cool stuff when you

579
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,279
have a you have

580
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,950
microcontroller and it's booting up

581
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:32,630
often vendors will enable to deserve

582
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:34,610
protection or debug protection that

583
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:36,679
prevents some people like us from going

584
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:40,129
in saying hey I want to enable to bugger

585
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:42,710
and access to expect reverse engineer so

586
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:44,000
they and when in development they don't

587
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:46,940
have that name let me go to production

588
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,980
maintain well the way that works is when

589
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:50,750
the chip is booting up a bootloader runs

590
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:52,279
and says okay I'm gonna execute this

591
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:55,940
instruction and check the value of this

592
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:57,740
use is this fuse set it says don't a lot

593
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:59,080
of debugger now the thing is all these

594
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,409
instructions that are running on the

595
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,210
microcontroller

596
00:25:00,409 --> 00:25:04,549
they take time right it takes some time

597
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:07,130
to do that and time it's a controlled by

598
00:25:04,549 --> 00:25:08,779
a clock so if you can do take something

599
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:11,450
like the clock even glitch it you can

600
00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:13,370
say okay it takes 10 nanoseconds to run

601
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:15,169
this command so normally the clock

602
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:17,270
query you say you know what normally

603
00:25:15,169 --> 00:25:18,770
takes 10 nanoseconds but for this one

604
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:20,658
cycle we're gonna make that one annual

605
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:22,970
cycle so the transistors don't even have

606
00:25:20,659 --> 00:25:25,100
enough time to check and it gets to the

607
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:27,020
next segment you just skip that check

608
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:28,668
before that no computer the bug means

609
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:30,799
because we're not gonna we're not gonna

610
00:25:28,669 --> 00:25:31,940
lose clock cycle it is use the bottom

611
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,799
and it seems they don't get virtually

612
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,480
from the clock cycle English and then

613
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:37,610
that doesn't I'll have to be voter

614
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,830
protection we can choose five seconds

615
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:42,830
automated leaves it there half an hour

616
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:44,928
later get full access code ship that

617
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:48,230
memory and then you can dump a bunch and

618
00:25:44,929 --> 00:25:49,720
now you can find another way to get

619
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:53,000
drivers depending on the type of router

620
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:55,520
right in many cases mind reserved and

621
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,270
permits go home on many kinds of

622
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,220
encrypted

623
00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:02,059
correctly problema Jenny was that mean

624
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:04,070
cryptid but here's the example I found I

625
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:06,980
got the zip file online and downloaded

626
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:09,320
it unzipped it makes big wok which

627
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:13,279
wasn't littler than count Mac OS like or

628
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:15,439
did just imported some stuff made didn't

629
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:18,679
watch extract this type of file this was

630
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,690
a squash a test pilot and I just watched

631
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:23,059
a pheasant pulse wouldn't work my Mac so

632
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:23,899
I never get hype and I put links in all

633
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:26,570
of us so I'll make these slides

634
00:26:23,899 --> 00:26:28,668
available so I need a quarter of the

635
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:31,668
siwash FS cool so you can run on that it

636
00:26:28,669 --> 00:26:34,789
runs fine on those and this will unpack

637
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:37,510
the firmware for this rally monkey

638
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:37,510
starting

639
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:46,229
so cool but which is and that gives us a

640
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,660
reasonable inclination that there are

641
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:51,330
other functions right if we really want

642
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:53,549
to Center why using the SIP had a pretty

643
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:55,350
and it looks a further and going to eat

644
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:57,840
here so specific encode function alright

645
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:59,340
cool so if we look further in city code

646
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,600
and you're looking breath and graphic

647
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:02,820
you there's something interesting here

648
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,949
I'm loading this screen called invite

649
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:06,090
invite is a Pacific Command so the

650
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,650
registers and other stuff commands

651
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:10,918
justice if commands that are at the

652
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:12,570
beginning of only sipping and we're

653
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:15,840
doing this sprinkling case compare and

654
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:18,870
we're company to somewhere if it's zero

655
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:21,090
and not an otherwise daily you did not

656
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:23,219
that's what I'm saying is is the

657
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:25,918
beginning of this packet start with

658
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:28,290
register for a bike and if it doesn't a

659
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:34,140
big morning it's the entire packet which

660
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:36,928
normally even our b2b example is HTTP is

661
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:38,970
post right but news on HP both the first

662
00:28:36,929 --> 00:28:41,610
word in the teeth in the data portion of

663
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:43,260
your packet is the post and of course we

664
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:45,510
don't control out or every casual post

665
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,390
we can make it and get we might be a

666
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:48,550
little trigger

667
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:51,040
your offense but we can't just

668
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:52,810
arbitrarily control the data attention

669
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:55,270
in fact we can only arbitrarily to

670
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:58,030
control the middle burning in the most

671
00:28:55,270 --> 00:29:00,070
content so the problem is mongers and

672
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:01,780
routers look pathetic

673
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:04,570
thus if command they don't just ignore

674
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:06,220
line by line like these they're actually

675
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:09,490
looking at the very beginning of impact

676
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:11,680
so this is kind of a problem if I can't

677
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:13,180
I don't control that coordinator so as I

678
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,770
was saying like there's some other

679
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:16,450
techniques that we can use maybe there's

680
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:18,790
other verticals I can use other than a

681
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:21,570
sneaky to try to find out to this so I

682
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:25,090
started looking through chrome Flags

683
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:27,850
features go to the cross for us to start

684
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:29,350
different sockets there I started going

685
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:32,919
to get w3.org and looking through their

686
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:35,290
standards in this protocol I think I

687
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:37,870
could protocol and everybody just like

688
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:39,909
was hopping explained the explanation is

689
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:42,669
what I said and there's like what does

690
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:44,530
Apogee support explanation probably what

691
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:48,040
it says on the website but there's

692
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:50,889
excellence in transport natural the RFC

693
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:53,680
well document so I started going through

694
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:56,050
thanks to the HTTP HTTP FTP WebSocket

695
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:59,130
EMS some of the things that modern

696
00:29:56,050 --> 00:30:01,750
browsers support and I was looking at

697
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:04,780
now stun is something we solved with

698
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:09,040
what you see earlier yeah it sounds

699
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:10,300
pretty cool because it is I started

700
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,540
playing around with it seeing what we

701
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:14,830
could do in stock is already and as I

702
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:17,080
was playing with some of the that you

703
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:19,240
can click the user name and the username

704
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,870
is in plain text though Scott's Elvis on

705
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,810
Krypton

706
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:26,159
there is term and there's a return there

707
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:29,050
actually is encrypted stuff but it's not

708
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:31,360
so some it's always pop encrypted and

709
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:34,060
you can set a user and that user name I

710
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:36,250
just like playing around and accept the

711
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:38,560
user mainly to hello is it me you're

712
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:40,720
looking for I can see it in your eyes I

713
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:43,570
can see in your file with new lines and

714
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,250
we just included everything so there's

715
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:48,610
actually a character limit to use

716
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:53,550
maintenance on it so I was wondering

717
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:57,030
what they might send a lot more tape at

718
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:59,149
some point something's gonna break or

719
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:01,340
overflow or something

720
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:02,989
unfortunately the penny buffer overflows

721
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:05,090
but the packets didn't have to break

722
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:06,919
that this long because your Ethernet

723
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:11,720
controller your Wi-Fi can only have a

724
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:13,519
maximum transmission its IP so IP is

725
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,350
unplayable pregnant you will get back

726
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,419
your fabulous kitchen now singing well

727
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:19,719
is there a way that it may be tackling

728
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:22,789
that and figure out where doesn't play

729
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:24,769
if I send this really long use me right

730
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:26,419
you have this stone packet it's all the

731
00:31:24,769 --> 00:31:28,909
snot you can be stuff and then the

732
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:30,320
username and then it overflows well you

733
00:31:28,909 --> 00:31:32,389
can over closed well that's have another

734
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,428
packet and this is the beginning of a

735
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:36,678
packet that I potentially have purpose

736
00:31:34,429 --> 00:31:38,929
very controllable so if I can measure it

737
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:41,570
where it's going to fragment they can't

738
00:31:38,929 --> 00:31:43,159
buy just intentionally insert something

739
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:45,918
doesn't have a beginning of a secondary

740
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:56,330
package and I have arbitrary beauty

741
00:31:45,919 --> 00:32:03,769
medium so the answer is yes what but

742
00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:05,928
I've got a general stun stun server

743
00:32:03,769 --> 00:32:07,309
that's listening on my server and it

744
00:32:05,929 --> 00:32:09,769
says okay at what point does this

745
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:11,690
private and at that point I didn't send

746
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:13,369
back to the user basically the client

747
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:15,110
has a lot of talking open to me as well

748
00:32:13,369 --> 00:32:16,820
secondarily and through that website if

749
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:18,559
we step back to gate this is the size or

750
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:20,480
an IP packet this is the size of your

751
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:22,309
banking options to the size of your UK

752
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,249
packet this is the total size of a

753
00:32:22,309 --> 00:32:26,809
packet before a river flow and so now

754
00:32:25,249 --> 00:32:29,240
what you want to do is you want to send

755
00:32:26,809 --> 00:32:31,100
a single arbitrary packet would be using

756
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,740
long enough that Duke is exactly to this

757
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:35,449
single byte that then overflows and then

758
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:38,629
you said you're still packing

759
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:42,429
now that is pretty cool and what that

760
00:32:38,629 --> 00:32:45,709
allows you to do is open any UVB work up

761
00:32:42,429 --> 00:32:47,659
all your DB ports and then port or the

762
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:49,940
with the victim may be nothing but

763
00:32:47,659 --> 00:32:53,119
visiting website now this was pretty

764
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:55,789
cool except that that's PGP and TVs

765
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:58,039
pretty boring we want to see his all the

766
00:32:55,789 --> 00:33:02,600
rules whoever service authorities rates

767
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:05,419
I think so TCP can we do the same thing

768
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:07,490
what if we send our post and we just

769
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:08,970
send in that post data there's a ton of

770
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:16,769
stuff

771
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:19,979
there's some dead pixels on my screen so

772
00:33:16,769 --> 00:33:23,899
if we sent a bunch of TCP post data we

773
00:33:19,979 --> 00:33:23,899
only control that that bottom portion

774
00:33:24,259 --> 00:33:30,690
and enemy send our synthetic can we do

775
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:33,509
this again you can have any TCP server

776
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:34,830
listening on TCP 5060 and that's a nice

777
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:37,999
thing about said is that it works for

778
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:41,489
both TCP a so that you send an HTTP POST

779
00:33:37,999 --> 00:33:44,759
massively large you can also get a

780
00:33:41,489 --> 00:33:54,479
little bit of control by by massaging

781
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:56,039
the TCP message sides essentially when

782
00:33:54,479 --> 00:33:57,899
you connect to something the server can

783
00:33:56,039 --> 00:34:00,090
say it makes that packet whistle of size

784
00:33:57,899 --> 00:34:02,248
so that makes it even easier so you can

785
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:04,289
you can have a good connection connect

786
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:06,149
to you you then respond hey I only

787
00:34:04,289 --> 00:34:09,149
accept packets of this size and then you

788
00:34:06,149 --> 00:34:11,368
already know where it's been pretty at

789
00:34:09,149 --> 00:34:14,489
that point you then you get these

790
00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:15,750
perfect precision controllable in the

791
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:17,428
second packet the second type of the

792
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:19,980
beginning of the post well if on the

793
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:21,690
third packet where it's hard to see but

794
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:23,609
you have a man and that was our original

795
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:25,260
system and we met in college he address

796
00:34:23,609 --> 00:34:26,909
including the port number that you want

797
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:29,399
to open and you can perform this in a

798
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:31,889
loop and do this for 65,000 ports you

799
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:34,279
literally just enable DMZ got some up

800
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:37,440
router just by them visiting a website

801
00:34:34,279 --> 00:34:39,119
this is named this is essentially what

802
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,500
happens right victim this is a website

803
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,419
Rudy and then through the router through

804
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,219
the internet is the Muslim web site

805
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:45,779
could just load your JavaScript with

806
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:47,399
your evil doctrine so it can be a normal

807
00:34:45,779 --> 00:34:48,260
site and you can be a malicious

808
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:50,578
advertiser

809
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:51,869
then it sends this data back in your

810
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:53,579
browser does all this automatically

811
00:34:51,869 --> 00:34:56,069
doesn't request anything for you

812
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:58,470
and you get a laboratory this defective

813
00:34:56,069 --> 00:35:00,839
injection through their theology just

814
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:02,759
which is pretty cool this is a simple

815
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:04,319
example it's gonna be hard to see any of

816
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:06,390
this stuff but essentially it because

817
00:35:04,319 --> 00:35:07,980
begins running first to determine what

818
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:09,868
every five men and then on that some

819
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:12,349
that determines what is whether it be

820
00:35:09,869 --> 00:35:12,349
upwards

821
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:25,399
he'd send a bunch of large packets it

822
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:27,470
measures the size of the packet that

823
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,780
returns though those sizes are then in

824
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:32,598
generates a post on the back on the back

825
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:35,480
the background began it generate the SIP

826
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:37,400
packet example is a packet and we go in

827
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,200
malady on the server side that this is a

828
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,180
packet with receipt probably we fizzle

829
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,310
what happens is the router will change

830
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,810
occasional on key Dresden of guidance so

831
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:47,328
they can validate new Christmas Eve did

832
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:50,690
properly and the cipa server the server

833
00:35:47,329 --> 00:35:52,430
that's running response in both HTTP and

834
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:54,380
sent back to the clients of the browser

835
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:56,118
actually closes the connection properly

836
00:35:54,380 --> 00:36:00,380
and of the system and then the router

837
00:35:56,119 --> 00:36:02,680
thinks it's totally legit and we're to

838
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,680
network

839
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:19,570
[Applause]

840
00:37:45,309 --> 00:38:06,609
also I saw your clothes so the second is

841
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:09,910
107 and 16 is my way you write to five

842
00:38:06,609 --> 00:38:12,130
is broadcast so that is myself so we're

843
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:13,740
going to milliseconds but you get

844
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:21,420
microseconds

845
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:22,770
yeah my god oh I will imagine that I

846
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:25,050
think I probably just make that a

847
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:25,860
separate project it's a useful caustic

848
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:27,570
library

849
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:29,670
I don't looking everything's happening

850
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:33,570
so I do do inverse so I could fly by

851
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:35,100
piece of the time you don't have your

852
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:37,290
browser do too much if they might

853
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:48,690
actually exist I found that when I try

854
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:53,580
to hold them you know they could web RTC

855
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:55,619
change but it wasn't a process I am

856
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:59,819
Brian made up like I want to beat it

857
00:38:55,619 --> 00:39:16,020
wrong so I don't know and Safari doesn't

858
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:24,810
do it at all yes it is started yeah at

859
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:26,009
some point they did that and actually I

860
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:41,570
do be curious

861
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:41,570
I came a little late but I noticed a lot

862
00:39:42,619 --> 00:39:47,760
perfect so a lot of the exploits

863
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:49,350
regarding ship and so forth so if you're

864
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,090
on the other side of the of the offense

865
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:54,960
there you're trying to keep trying to

866
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:57,000
make ship defensible in a in a company

867
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,060
or whatever yeah that's a good question

868
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,790
so about not looking sick or really

869
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:03,720
exploiting the router potentially in

870
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:06,810
maybe the browser

871
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:08,700
oh I mean what I was suggesting in this

872
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:11,580
scenario is disable sit a little cheap

873
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:14,310
so your router allows you to do that

874
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:16,560
definitely commercial stuff will do that

875
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:19,109
okay not all the consumer surplus can do

876
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:21,810
that however that means it will stop

877
00:40:19,109 --> 00:40:24,600
working so it also he became as quiz

878
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:26,400
right people unless you then

879
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:35,910
attention important forward but then you

880
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:37,650
can only have like a single voice or you

881
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:39,930
could make the next part and you could

882
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:44,160
say you know what let me not leagues but

883
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:46,609
that this was like the TCP segment but

884
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,990
that's not guaranteed because you can

885
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:51,060
like it's eating with IP fragmentation

886
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:56,879
is from this is the records that I that

887
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:58,950
I don't think but there's some other

888
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,510
cool stuff so for exactly press mention

889
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:01,560
that in the turn stuff I was doing when

890
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:06,450
I was trying to be political in these

891
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:10,140
other sock these other all those reports

892
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:12,330
those who only apply to PhDs making your

893
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:14,700
accent right so kind of in stores or

894
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:17,549
something is you need to go to turn or

895
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:22,560
cidade they don't do not have access to

896
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:28,710
all because their only motivation so you

897
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:31,020
can actually buy cash anyways I also

898
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:32,400
know that Firefox actually made this is

899
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:34,860
a little bit more challenging using

900
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:38,220
Firefox when you have your HTTP POST

901
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:41,780
this is a kid content why that is the

902
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:41,779
essentially the delimiter for your post

903
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:48,089
but basically the fun is that string

904
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:50,459
will change lengths so even though if I

905
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:51,810
use the link for the first post as soon

906
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:53,430
as I determine what the length of it

907
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:56,279
would then change fortunately it was

908
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:57,960
only in a few fights so they just if it

909
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,490
detects Firefox and it seemed that thing

910
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,190
this changes it just has it a couple

911
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:07,319
more times and after about four bus it

912
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:09,030
will Instagram her for a router

913
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:14,760
obviously this for one specific router

914
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:16,860
do you find me I saw absolutely

915
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:18,960
impossible routers so I was coming back

916
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:22,080
something Robert so it's exactly pine

917
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:25,890
trees from other others definitely

918
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:28,819
hiring some others so it smells a nice

919
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:28,819
about it that's pretty

920
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:48,799
great idea probably you'll probably just

921
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:50,830
hit the children by and then it doesn't

922
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,960
response that you know you're not on

923
00:42:50,830 --> 00:43:00,020
slash 24 right and then the next week we

924
00:42:53,960 --> 00:43:01,190
technically not just needs but I suppose

925
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:04,640
that you can do is actually you could

926
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:08,890
just keep keep doing this until you hit

927
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:11,480
something that it's similar Chris this

928
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:13,819
gateway voice Aria broadcast books

929
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:15,560
similar become faster and your own IP

930
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:17,960
address changes little minute maybe

931
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:19,340
that's group and then after that if you

932
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:21,130
get no responses than you know that your

933
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:23,990
mother you know that's yours right

934
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:27,140
master and then you know your net mask

935
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:28,850
but I never played without W cool I mean

936
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:34,100
there should be we should definitely

937
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:36,130
iterator off this is a hello lose in

938
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:39,650
court for date

939
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:41,030
that's a big question I don't know I

940
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:45,110
don't think it's a long time though

941
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:47,360
there's those hand I don't need to long

942
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:49,940
time but you know what's happening

943
00:43:47,360 --> 00:44:14,150
because they get your server right baby

944
00:43:49,940 --> 00:44:16,310
asleep your server and then you can

945
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:19,940
probably do it over WebSockets like

946
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:23,240
technically about is a drug

947
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:25,640
companies do you end up having HT socket

948
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:27,439
and you can generate and then you send I

949
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,060
think is a great request an upgrade

950
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,070
request that says they upgraded

951
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:35,560
WebSockets

952
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:39,150
and then they'd arrive like I don't know

953
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:39,150
if I don't know
