to tell you a story

17
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,519
and the story i will tell you is about

18
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,439
the good the bad and the ugly of

19
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,239
starting a security company and i'm

20
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,879
going to give you the inside of the

21
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,200
experience from starting a security

22
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,599
company through the successful selling

23
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,680
of that security company for over 60

24
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,560
million dollars to prove point

25
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,759
uh the journey was a four-year journey

26
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,639
and

27
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,440
uh

28
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,320
along that journey there were a lot of

29
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,800
learning experiences and hopefully

30
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,479
they will be of some

31
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,400
value to you so uh assuming my audio is

32
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,720
working and you're ready to take that

33
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,560
journey with me and join me on this

34
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,720
story i'm gonna dive in

35
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,040
um

36
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,479
all right

37
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,720
with no further ado

38
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,080
uh

39
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,600
i'm going to go through a little bit

40
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,600
about the company and the experience but

41
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,680
mostly focus on the moments of truth the

42
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,680
the moments where we really had to

43
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,800
change adapt pivot

44
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,440
to find our way as a company to survive

45
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,919
to make it to that point where a public

46
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,000
company proof point decided we were

47
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,039
worth

48
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,479
over 60 million dollars

49
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,360
so

50
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,600
as far as the company starting i was uh

51
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,479
a reasonably happy partner at deloitte

52
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,240
national security

53
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,960
privacy or cyber partner who was also

54
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,759
running their privacy practice and

55
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,960
at the time in 2013

56
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,600
symantec was selling its global dlp

57
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,600
licenses

58
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,479
and

59
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,800
there was an interesting dilemma

60
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,000
developing between privacy law and

61
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
privacy requirements

62
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,160
and the competing needs to achieve

63
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,039
security and what i mean is

64
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,479
dop was monitoring employees at a level

65
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,479
we hadn't seen before

66
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,440
so we were we were getting uh

67
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,440
intelligence uh some people were

68
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,919
monitoring literally keyboard

69
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,600
activity uh and user activity at a level

70
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,199
that was uh some people considered too

71
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,720
much and

72
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,639
my idea

73
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,160
started as a balancing of privacy and

74
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,000
security using a remote browser at the

75
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,960
time

76
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,639
it was going to be based on oracle

77
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,360
virtualbox a client-side technology to

78
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,919
containerize and to

79
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,720
provide make private the user's browsing

80
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,400
experience from

81
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,240
the monitoring of a corporate

82
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,360
environment

83
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,680
balancing security by saying hey since

84
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,600
we're in this oracle virtualbox

85
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,960
container

86
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,120
we're not going to get any malware into

87
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,520
the company we're not going to cause any

88
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,800
problems

89
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,840
and so

90
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,639
allowing the employee to privately

91
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,199
browse the internet to do their personal

92
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,440
email and other activities

93
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,240
would be of relatively low risk

94
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,720
so the idea really came up while i was

95
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,360
in a meeting with the chief information

96
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,520
security officer of a public company

97
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,720
named amgen a

98
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,759
biopharmaceutical company

99
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,680
and we were sitting there i was the

100
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,199
partner he was the ciso and we were just

101
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,360
talking about the dilemmas and the

102
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,680
european regulatory problems he had with

103
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,080
deploying dlp

104
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,840
and this idea came up that while

105
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,120
wouldn't it be great if we could

106
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,599
maintain privacy while also maintaining

107
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,080
security and he thought it was a great

108
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,280
idea

109
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,680
and he said if you build something like

110
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,680
that i would buy it

111
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,199
and so based on that conversation

112
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,560
i resigned a perfectly good partnership

113
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,080
at deloitte

114
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,199
i was

115
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,879
it was viewed as an act of insanity and

116
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:45,840
uh

117
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,720
the resulting company that was created

118
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,400
uh ended up

119
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,199
in that after that leap at

120
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,520
the time of our acquisition four years

121
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,000
later as a company with 22 employees

122
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,240
we had raised

123
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,759
capital from

124
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,400
various sources including a tier one

125
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,160
venture firm we had raised three and a

126
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,560
half million dollars in capital we had

127
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,840
18 customers a few million dollars in

128
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,280
revenue

129
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,400
and

130
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,759
we were by all measures a

131
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,919
great exciting early stage company

132
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,039
but the story beneath this sort of

133
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,360
profile that we had at the time of

134
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,919
acquisition with big customer names on

135
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,479
the right you could see amgen and eli

136
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,599
lilly

137
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,080
kaiser permanente at a large

138
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,599
healthcare company

139
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,080
the story beneath that was

140
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,360
a little more interesting um just on the

141
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,920
flavor of the company

142
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,360
i had really

143
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,760
two key founding partners and i can't

144
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,160
emphasize enough how important it was to

145
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,880
get people on that journey with me i had

146
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,680
a wonderful chief technology officer who

147
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,640
was innovative i had a chief product

148
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,080
officer who adapted and was great

149
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,440
but my core development team was really

150
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,200
three russians

151
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,920
you know an amazing you know the the

152
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,519
power of one amazing developer is really

153
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,200
unbelievable and

154
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,760
you know i've since i've run manage

155
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,640
development teams with dozens and dozens

156
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,360
of engineers at the same time and

157
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,600
you know having just

158
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,680
several innovative

159
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,240
you know one core team but my product

160
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,360
was really

161
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,000
created brought to life and you know it

162
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,880
was those three russians and one

163
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,120
guy from belarus that were really at the

164
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,920
core of my development team

165
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,640
all my sales were contracted you know

166
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,560
mercenary type

167
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,760
sales folks i had a virtual

168
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,760
finance team in fact

169
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,760
all of my employees were virtual

170
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,200
employees we were 100 remote which is

171
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,560
increasingly common now but at the time

172
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,920
was a wild risk and

173
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,200
frankly

174
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,760
it was a real complication when we tried

175
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,519
to sell the company to convince

176
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,920
proofpoint that we were worth the kind

177
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,160
of money they were spending because the

178
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,480
idea of a virtual company didn't really

179
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,839
seem like a real company

180
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,440
so let me just

181
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,160
take a second on the journey we took at

182
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,399
a very high level right in 2013

183
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,200
we i started this company i resigned my

184
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,920
partnership i took

185
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,320
all the money i could get my hands on it

186
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,640
was around a quarter of a million

187
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,720
dollars 250 000

188
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,920
and i spent that first year

189
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,680
building a product

190
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,560
and

191
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,480
it really wasn't much of a product when

192
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,440
i look back taking an open source

193
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,640
platform like oracle virtualbox

194
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,519
and trying to make it into

195
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,880
a product

196
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,680
was

197
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,160
incredible trying to lock it down and

198
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,240
make it so employees couldn't mess with

199
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,480
their image so that it looked like

200
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,160
commercial grade software so that would

201
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,600
be installed this is a very heavy client

202
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,480
to put onto someone's desk

203
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,640
but after about a year

204
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,120
we had built a product we had tested it

205
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,560
with amgen

206
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,720
that ciso had made good on his

207
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,320
commitment he was the one person that

208
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,519
key one relationship and in june of 2014

209
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,240
we signed the contract with amgen

210
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,040
it was a big contract for us hundreds of

211
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,800
thousands of dollars that contract i

212
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,959
think was a 350 000 or more first-year

213
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,560
contract

214
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,040
and in that moment we had

215
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,920
created revenue and we had a client i

216
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,440
had 350 000 in the bank

217
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,480
and i thought we were done we were we

218
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,240
were on our way

219
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,360
right we

220
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,440
we had some money and we went out trying

221
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,760
to sell this product that we

222
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,600
packaged up by november as silo

223
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,160
it went to public release if you build

224
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,010
it and

225
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,160
[Music]

226
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,399
nobody really came i mean i'll tell you

227
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,360
the hard knock story to to present the

228
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,320
marketing story by june of 2015 a year

229
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,399
later we finally closed a second

230
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,720
customer and again a lot of this was

231
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,360
personal relationships i went out on the

232
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,560
road and

233
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,760
sold to every ciso i knew

234
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,760
by october of 2015 we had pivoted to a

235
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,240
client-less version of this

236
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,240
i don't i won't take you down the

237
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,800
journey of how hard a client is but let

238
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,680
me just as one example we tried to

239
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,720
deploy

240
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,800
virtualbox to

241
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,040
various countries for amgen

242
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,200
they tried to move it to france and they

243
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,880
tried to push through

244
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,920
thousands of deployments as separate

245
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,279
packages and took france offline for the

246
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,639
company

247
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,720
so a heavy client

248
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,720
terrible most companies wouldn't even

249
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,279
look at a heavy client as a deployment

250
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,519
because it's too much trouble but by

251
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,800
october of 2015 we had a clientless

252
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,480
cloud product

253
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,399
by

254
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:26,720
2016 we had 25 000

255
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,440
users on the product we had citibank

256
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,880
talking to us

257
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,639
and in november of 2016 we finally

258
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,000
closed a vc round of funding

259
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,800
we must have met with every tier one

260
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,839
silicon valley investor

261
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,399
who basically turned us away we thought

262
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,079
on the strength of having a public

263
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,120
company client we would be there but

264
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,959
no

265
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:53,920
by

266
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,720
january of 17 we were globally deployed

267
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,199
in 40 countries

268
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,720
in may after rsa we closed eli lilly

269
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,560
another 60 000 user deal

270
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,360
and from there things took off

271
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,320
and

272
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,480
by the end of 2017 just four years later

273
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,560
proof point announced our acquisition

274
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,279
for 60 million dollars

275
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,600
today proofpoint has integrated our

276
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,240
technology into their core platforms we

277
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,120
have millions and millions of users

278
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,639
around the world

279
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,440
and a revenue run rate that has gone up

280
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,959
to approximately 100 million dollars so

281
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,800
there are companies all over the world

282
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,600
major brands now using our technology

283
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,079
for remote browsing um in various forms

284
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,199
so

285
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,760
we've become the engine of proof points

286
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,240
remote browsing capability that is built

287
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,399
into their their core technology

288
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,920
but let me back up and talk more about

289
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,959
the moments of truth in starting and

290
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,199
running a company um

291
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,160
the

292
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,959
the first one i want to talk about is

293
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,880
are just complete and total failure

294
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,639
to go to market

295
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,320
you know layered against the same

296
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,680
timeline

297
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,639
i'll just highlight that basically

298
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,320
short of sony from

299
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,360
the

300
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,279
starting of the company and closing of

301
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,000
amgen in 2014 which we thought would

302
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,800
then

303
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,560
open the floodgates

304
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,320
we really just had two customers sony

305
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,160
and eli lilly

306
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,120
and you could argue those were lucky in

307
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,519
the way they came together i mean eli

308
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,399
lilly i can't underestimate the power of

309
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,440
industry you know eli lilly trusted that

310
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,199
if amgen did it

311
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,519
it would make sense for them

312
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,199
so eli lilly took a leap because of that

313
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,959
but more importantly

314
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,680
eli lilly had a progressive ciso who had

315
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,079
never worked in security

316
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,360
any security person who we went to and

317
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,639
said let's give your employees a right

318
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,600
to privacy in the workplace

319
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,399
said

320
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,320
why would i want to do that

321
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,720
you know i want telemetry on everything

322
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,759
they do

323
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,240
i don't want to give them privacy

324
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,079
the whole idea

325
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,959
of granting employees a right to privacy

326
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,880
for personal browsing

327
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,160
even in a contained secure space

328
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,440
seemed like a stupid idea to them

329
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,440
so we really failed on our whole story

330
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,560
of

331
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,240
balancing privacy and security creating

332
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,639
you know a kinder gentler world by

333
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,720
giving employees a right to privacy

334
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,120
while still maintaining security

335
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,600
that whole story just failed

336
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,360
and it took me way too long to realize

337
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,279
that that story wasn't going to work i

338
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,680
kept pitching that story

339
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,440
long after every ciso had told me it

340
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,039
didn't work

341
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,319
and that was one of my big failures and

342
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,039
challenges was not pivoting

343
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,280
earlier on that

344
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,760
i'll tell you my next failure

345
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,679
other than a complete failure in my

346
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,039
go-to-market

347
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,480
cash

348
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,079
oh my god

349
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,839
you know it turns out

350
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,319
that the wisdom i got from one of my

351
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,359
mentors

352
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,120
was if you just don't run out of money

353
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,799
you win

354
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,880
that the trick really along the same

355
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,080
timeline is one if you run out of cash

356
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,320
the story ends right

357
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,480
that is the only key measure of your

358
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,320
success if you

359
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,200
maintain enough cash to keep operating

360
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,960
you ultimately will succeed in some form

361
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,720
in my journey

362
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
i thought i was putting a fortune into

363
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,000
this company my savings everything i had

364
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,679
that 250 thousand dollars

365
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,880
i spent it at a pace thinking

366
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,360
this would all happen really easily

367
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,919
right it was gonna work i burned through

368
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,400
that money with consultants and building

369
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,600
a product i built a failed product kept

370
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,600
building

371
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,559
and

372
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,960
if i hadn't closed amgen oh there was

373
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,520
wasn't 350 it was 450. if i had not

374
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,919
closed amgen which gave us an infusion

375
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,480
of 450 000 of cash

376
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,720
we would have we would have failed

377
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,400
and in fact

378
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,000
when i got to

379
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,280
the end of 2015 we were about out of

380
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,360
money again i'll give you the specifics

381
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,440
of how close we came

382
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,160
but at the end of 2015

383
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,400
we had started to build a client-less

384
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,120
version to get off oracle virtualbox and

385
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,720
we were close

386
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,280
but i had decided to shut down the

387
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,559
company i just didn't see a way to fund

388
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,360
it

389
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,280
i i couldn't think of any way to come up

390
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,960
with the money

391
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,000
and

392
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,799
my

393
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,360
one of my teachers from school was

394
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,919
having lunch with me a little old lady

395
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,720
with barely any retirement

396
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,440
and she believed in me so much she said

397
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,480
i'll write you a check for 25 000 you

398
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,320
you i believe in you

399
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,240
more than i believed in myself at the

400
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,120
time i was beaten down

401
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,280
and at that point i decided to try and

402
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,600
go to everybody i knew

403
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,840
i went to my rich uncle

404
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,440
and he said

405
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,080
no i don't think so david i just don't

406
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,480
believe this is gonna work

407
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,320
i had to raise money from people i

408
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,559
thought i would never take money from my

409
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,799
parents cut into their savings and

410
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,320
retirement money

411
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,360
and came up with money i went to my my

412
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,000
wife's my step parents and asked them

413
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,799
for money it was an incredibly humbling

414
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,360
event i went to every friend i had

415
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,760
scraping up 10 000 here

416
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,000
25 000 there

417
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,039
and by the time i was done

418
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,360
i had raised about five hundred thousand

419
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,520
dollars and now

420
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,960
i was for the first time really scared

421
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,000
because if i lost my parents retirement

422
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,120
money

423
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,919
for the first time i i was like this is

424
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,640
going to be awful right what am i doing

425
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,960
am i insane

426
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,480
and sure enough

427
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,240
less than a year later

428
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,159
i was out of money again

429
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,000
i was at the edge

430
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,720
and now i was really panicked

431
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,960
and one of the most creative things we

432
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,400
did in the company

433
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,520
was i didn't realize the power of having

434
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,080
that single client amgen

435
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,159
and i went to them and i said

436
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,039
i got a great deal for you because i

437
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,039
love you so much as one of my key

438
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,159
clients

439
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,080
one of my only clients

440
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,640
i'll give you a great deal if you

441
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,320
pre-pay

442
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,880
three years in advance i'll give you an

443
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,600
incredible discount and it's really a

444
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,600
gift to you to know that i'm not going

445
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,360
to raise my rates because things are

446
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,120
blowing up for us

447
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,600
and i was able to get amgen to do a

448
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,039
three-year continuation deal

449
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,120
and raise 900 000

450
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,720
from them

451
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,600
i think a lot of people don't realize

452
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,039
that a customer

453
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,720
that you can use a customer to

454
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,559
capitalize a company

455
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,480
when i couldn't raise money i was

456
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,559
failing i had met with

457
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,960
every tier one vc i could get an

458
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,840
introduction to in silicon valley and

459
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,159
they had all said i don't think this

460
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,200
privacy idea is such a great idea

461
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,159
and

462
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,000
i managed to raise that from amgen

463
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,440
at that point

464
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,159
and i'll talk about this in a second we

465
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,360
had pivoted our story a little bit and

466
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,039
we finally found a single vc

467
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,240
it was not a silicon valley vc we found

468
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,679
a vc

469
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,760
in denmark

470
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,400
that was trying to sell a story that

471
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,679
they were

472
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,280
also working in silicon valley so they

473
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,440
had opened a little office there

474
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,559
and

475
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,520
they

476
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,600
believed in the privacy story because

477
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,360
they were a european country and they

478
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,320
understood gdpr and some of the privacy

479
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,520
requirements

480
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,799
and we raised three million dollars in

481
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,960
vc funding

482
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,000
at a decent valuation so we had a

483
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,159
roughly 10 million dollar post money

484
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,720
valuation so a company now that's got

485
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,520
like

486
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,600
three clients right

487
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,080
um that was pretty good but some of that

488
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,039
is

489
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,919
because valuations are often done by

490
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,559
whatever you raise whatever the amount

491
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:45,280
is

492
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,480
is going to be

493
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,280
about 25 to 30 percent

494
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,200
of the equity of the company right so

495
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,120
there's just a rule of thumb that if you

496
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,679
raise three million then you're probably

497
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,159
a nine or ten million dollar company so

498
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,000
if you can get somebody to put in that

499
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,159
money if it's a million then you're

500
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,919
worth three or four million if it's

501
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,679
three million then you're worth about 10

502
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,159
million and we got them to raise 3

503
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,240
million at a 10 million post money

504
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,520
valuation

505
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,280
and from there

506
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,200
things started to click into place

507
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,840
eli lilly came soon after

508
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,960
and

509
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,280
the story in

510
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,520
2017's really a fun story

511
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,520
but before i get there i'll just

512
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,400
highlight how desperate things were on

513
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,640
the financial side

514
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,799
we had gotten to a point

515
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,720
when i closed that friends and family

516
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,760
round

517
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,240
i had literally five thousand dollars in

518
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,559
the bank and i had a 20 000 a month burn

519
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,520
with my contract employees

520
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,559
and

521
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,880
if people would have probably known how

522
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,640
close things were

523
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,320
i think everybody would have just

524
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,799
abandoned ship

525
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,880
again by the time i closed that

526
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,720
series a

527
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,039
i had 20 000

528
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,960
left in the bank and i was burning

529
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,640
probably 80 000 a month at that point we

530
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,000
had ramped up

531
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,640
and i was just lucky that that venture

532
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,679
capital firm was somewhat inexperienced

533
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:18,880
frankly

534
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,919
and

535
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,039
didn't really recheck the books because

536
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,960
if they would have fully known how close

537
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,880
to the edge i was they probably would

538
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,440
have renegotiated the deal or run away

539
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,360
by the time i got to july 2017 when

540
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,159
things were really starting to look good

541
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,279
i had

542
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,400
again down to 22 000 in the bank and now

543
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,400
i was probably burning 150 000 a month

544
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,480
at this point

545
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,640
i had an option so that

546
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,200
three million dollars of venture capital

547
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,400
it was

548
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,039
really not three million it was two

549
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,320
point

550
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,559
like 1.75 million of cash up front with

551
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,279
an option at the venture capital firm's

552
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,039
discretion to put in another 1.25

553
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,520
so i had to convince them that things

554
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,720
were looking so great that they should

555
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,640
definitely take that option and give me

556
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,480
the additional money so that they could

557
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,720
have more equity in what was going to be

558
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,039
an amazing story

559
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,039
and it turned out to be an amazing story

560
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,520
for them that vc firm that put in three

561
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,120
million dollars

562
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,240
cleared

563
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,400
about six months later

564
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,960
about 20 million dollars so if you think

565
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,720
about it the return on investment for

566
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,200
that 1.25 they put in

567
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,000
they did okay

568
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,559
but where i want to go now and i really

569
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:45,760
am going to

570
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,520
wrap up pretty soon and see if there's

571
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,279
any questions pretty soon but where i

572
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,880
want to go now is

573
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,600
the key pivot points in the company

574
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,039
because i think

575
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,760
sometimes you get so caught up in the

576
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,320
things you've built or the stories

577
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,919
you've created

578
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,000
that you're not willing to

579
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,400
adapt or pivot

580
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,720
and abandon those stories

581
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,159
and i would say to you that

582
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,120
any

583
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,360
entrepreneur that is successful goes

584
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,640
through at least two or three pivots at

585
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,440
a very fundamental level

586
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,559
for me

587
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,919
the first pivot was when i had abandoned

588
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,559
the client-side technology the oracle

589
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,679
virtualbox platform we had spent

590
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,039
at the time

591
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:37,440
years right two years almost building

592
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,400
and

593
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,279
we had to recognize that

594
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,520
no one was going to buy this that the

595
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,360
amount of intellectual property created

596
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,440
in adapting open source like oracle

597
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,440
virtualbox and trying to lock down an

598
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,720
image

599
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,080
it was a pain in the butt to deploy

600
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,640
and not valued

601
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,039
and it just wasn't working

602
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,880
and around this time

603
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,440
you know for those of you technically no

604
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,919
docker and some platforms were blowing

605
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,480
up that created the possibility that we

606
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,000
could move

607
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,679
this idea off-prem and virtualize

608
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,000
browsing technology

609
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,640
with completely

610
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,919
cloud-based sort of implementations that

611
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,159
essentially were mapping a user's

612
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,679
browser experience

613
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,600
without any plug-in without anything

614
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,000
that we could take a browsing experience

615
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,320
and essentially man in the middle of the

616
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,440
browser

617
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,480
and transform and so

618
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,520
browser agnostic you know my client-side

619
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,240
container was adapting and

620
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,760
pre-processing

621
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,919
cleansing any script executing any

622
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,399
script in a virtual container and then

623
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,279
delivering down just good old-fashioned

624
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:55,440
html to the client side with our script

625
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,080
to manage any change events and to

626
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,240
mirror change events up to our

627
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,520
cloud-based

628
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,080
man in the middle to replay those

629
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,880
against the server to react to any

630
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,279
events that were serviced as well as any

631
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,080
changes and mirror goes back down

632
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,200
that change in technology approach

633
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,039
set the stage for

634
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,799
all of our success

635
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,159
that adaptation on technology

636
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,720
but the second and maybe most painful

637
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,840
pivot came really later when we gave up

638
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,200
the privacy story now

639
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,360
my dirty little secret is

640
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,279
that those

641
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,440
millions and millions of users out there

642
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,679
now that hundred million dollar product

643
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,559
line that i have going at fortune 500

644
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,520
companies all around the planet

645
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,960
that still

646
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,360
grants the end user

647
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,360
a limited right to privacy in the

648
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,880
workplace

649
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,159
it still achieves the privacy story

650
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,120
but i couldn't sell the privacy story

651
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,559
i had to sell a security story

652
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,200
security officers who were my buyers

653
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,520
weren't going to pay for privacy

654
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,399
if it was a byproduct use case

655
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:11,600
maybe

656
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,240
but they weren't buying privacy they

657
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,840
were buying security they were buying

658
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,240
that we were preventing malware from

659
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,480
getting onto the endpoint right that was

660
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,080
what they were buying

661
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,039
right

662
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,520
so we had to completely refocus the way

663
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,279
we told the story

664
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,919
and it was heartbreaking for me because

665
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,080
i wanted to change the world and grant

666
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,679
users a right to privacy in the

667
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,520
workplace i wanted to deal with big

668
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,480
brother and rebalance

669
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,600
the security story to create a fine a

670
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,399
kinder gentler sort of approach but i

671
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,520
had to let all that go

672
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,039
finally

673
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,919
we cultivated you know our story in the

674
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,799
end as browser isolation a remote

675
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:59,039
browser story we embraced where gartner

676
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,559
had gone with it

677
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:01,600
and

678
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,919
that became our final story the story

679
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,320
that proof point purchased the story

680
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,360
that took us to success

681
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,320
but some stories are subtler when we

682
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,760
were acquired

683
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,360
proofpoint said

684
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,840
i i can't have russian developers

685
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,080
building our security software

686
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,200
the optics don't work so we actually

687
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,240
ended up having to relocate

688
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,200
our software developers from russia i

689
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,960
had to convince them

690
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,600
to sign on board and move to

691
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,200
one of the other countries in this case

692
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,600
they took they chose the uk

693
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,480
in order to close that deal and i can

694
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,760
talk more about the difficulties of m a

695
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,840
and all of the amazing i could have done

696
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,360
this whole talk

697
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,240
just on the story of going through the

698
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,360
merger and acquisition process of just

699
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,200
going through proof point there were

700
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,360
moments when that deal fell apart and

701
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,559
came back

702
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,720
the ability to do that deal that could

703
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,880
be my whole story and i'd be happy to

704
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,760
talk more about the experience of trying

705
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,039
to pitch

706
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,279
and sell your company and how that

707
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:10,320
happened

708
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,640
and it was an incredible story

709
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,399
and it's one thing when you're doing it

710
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,120
as an outsider but if the result of that

711
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,480
story is

712
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,120
my life's gonna change right i now don't

713
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,200
have to work anymore i now have millions

714
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,679
of dollars right if the deal goes

715
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,679
through i win if the deal doesn't go

716
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,240
through the company might collapse

717
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,760
that that part's a whole different story

718
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,360
so i'll just sort of

719
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,679
wrap up with kind of the changed company

720
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,200
we became

721
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,679
you know i'd say you know from an

722
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,919
external perspective

723
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,760
and a lot of these changes we had to

724
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,799
deal with

725
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,440
didn't start from inside they were

726
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,559
external factors that shifted our story

727
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,960
and this is the luck part of a startup

728
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,360
you know is your company the right

729
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,200
company at the right time for the

730
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,039
marketplace

731
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,600
and in the beginning we weren't

732
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,000
right there was a product bromium out

733
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,240
there there was a product that had

734
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,559
splashed the market with isolation and

735
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,799
had ruined everyone's perception of it

736
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,399
had made it seem like

737
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,720
it was a terrible idea we had to

738
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,320
overcome that

739
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,559
gartner started to embrace isolation and

740
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,640
that was our first pivot point of

741
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,519
external story

742
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:26,880
the other one

743
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,880
which had been 15 years in the making

744
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,519
you know was the gdpr

745
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,559
guidance

746
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,480
that gave a real

747
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,200
exciting punch in the arm to our privacy

748
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,320
story

749
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,880
it was powerful it helped us close eli

750
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,000
lilly but it wasn't enough to prevent me

751
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,159
from pivoting

752
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:47,440
the final

753
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,320
and probably the biggest story

754
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,799
was really when symantec

755
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,360
decided to spend

756
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,600
roughly

757
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,640
240 million dollars to buy

758
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,399
a little-known

759
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,120
remote browsing company called fire

760
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,640
glass

761
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,840
and when that event

762
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,399
happened

763
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,399
everything changed

764
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,240
and i couldn't have anticipated that

765
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,120
event

766
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,279
it's still in hindsight looks like a

767
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,760
terrible mistake for symantec

768
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,000
a terrible overpayment

769
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,640
but the moment they did that

770
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,480
every competitor to symantec said i have

771
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,880
to have a position in remote browsing to

772
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,360
compete with the fire glass platform

773
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,600
that symantec is integrating

774
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,519
it made us real

775
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,880
all of the competitors menlo security

776
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,600
authenticate other players in the remote

777
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,679
browsing experience

778
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,200
they were really all small companies

779
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,480
menlo had raised a fair amount of

780
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,799
capital but we were all small

781
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,880
but when semantic did that

782
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,919
and bought fire goss all of a sudden

783
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,320
we had a buyer universe that you see at

784
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,240
the bottom of the page

785
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,919
that was incredible

786
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,519
we brought in a boutique m a firm

787
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,079
and we had them package us up

788
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,879
and take us out to all of the potential

789
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,719
buyers out there

790
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,440
to see if we could capitalize on

791
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,000
the excitement around remote browsing

792
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,079
that was taking browser isolation that

793
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,119
was happening because of symantec's

794
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,560
meeting now the interesting story is

795
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,320
every one of those companies wanted to

796
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,599
take a meeting

797
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,119
right we had

798
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,000
more than a dozen pitches to corp

799
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,359
development teams at these big companies

800
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,040
and all of them were curious they were

801
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,679
all trying to learn what was happening

802
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,440
try to make sense of the fire goss

803
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,639
acquisition

804
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,119
but none of them bit

805
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,280
the only company

806
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,599
that really went

807
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,760
to acquisition with us

808
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,359
was a company that we had been

809
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:00,160
introduced to six months earlier

810
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,480
and this made all the difference

811
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,520
one of my mentors and advisors

812
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,760
knowing that if you want to exit a

813
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,119
company

814
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,359
a year from now that you have to build

815
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,680
trust and relationship with potential

816
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,800
acquirers early start strategic

817
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,280
conversations with them

818
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,520
go to market conversations

819
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,839
partnership conversations

820
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,079
and we had done that with proofpoint i

821
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,720
had gotten an introduction to the ceo

822
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,320
we had started to talk about the

823
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,359
technology at a deep level inside their

824
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,359
advanced technology group

825
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,680
and they were a good company

826
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,520
we got very lucky

827
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,320
they

828
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,800
made and kept the promises they had to

829
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,520
us and when we

830
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,880
had this fire glass event take place

831
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,960
they were the one

832
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,000
that were

833
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,960
serious that took it all the way we had

834
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,040
some other people in the hunt

835
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,200
but they were the ones

836
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,240
that

837
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,800
did it not just because they saw remote

838
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,640
browsing as important

839
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,400
but because

840
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,720
they had had a trust level with us from

841
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,800
six months of due diligence

842
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,960
of conversations

843
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,960
and that made the difference

844
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,599
there's a lot more to that story of how

845
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,000
we close that deal

846
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,440
but

847
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,520
that's sort of the outline

848
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,400
and

849
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,720
i'll kind of stop

850
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,890
there and

851
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:29,280
[Music]

852
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,680
shift gears to see if there's

853
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,480
any questions worth talking about

854
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,760
thank you very much for your time

855
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,440
thanks to you

856
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,560
david

857
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,200
first question um what kind of browser

858
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,280
do you prefer

859
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,960
what kind of browser yeah

860
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,119
it was interesting because

861
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,560
you know i don't prefer any browser but

862
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,040
i live in a world where

863
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,520
you know what the deployments are at the

864
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,839
customers that you work with so

865
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,760
we lived in a world where

866
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,240
most of our customers had very small mac

867
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,720
deployments and they had very large pc

868
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,079
deployments and so ie was the dominant

869
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,920
browser when we started

870
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,880
edge

871
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,760
later

872
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,240
still ie because they're all behind on

873
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,200
technology at the big companies that

874
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,960
changed over the years while we were

875
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,720
there and google

876
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,680
started to become the most dominantly

877
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,280
used browser

878
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,040
on mac deployments of course it was

879
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,079
safari for me what was important was i

880
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,720
had to do translation in the cloud

881
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,960
because we had a

882
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,920
chromium instance in the cloud so all of

883
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,560
the browsing we ran and i guess that

884
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,240
would be my preference from a technical

885
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,119
perspective ultimately headless chromium

886
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,000
we were using chromium to do all of the

887
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,640
browsing from our point of interception

888
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,200
to the end websites but we had to then

889
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,359
convert it into a format

890
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,040
and essentially

891
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,240
change some of the html and change what

892
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,520
we sent back

893
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,119
uh spoofing effectively the browsers

894
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,920
that were all on the endpoints so we

895
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,200
were spoofing to accommodate ie

896
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,359
and chrome and

897
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,359
safari i don't know if that answers the

898
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,119
question but

899
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,640
okay

900
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,760
what is the best moment to start looking

901
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,200
for investors in an end in a very little

902
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,040
enterprise what is the worst moment to

903
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,560
the enterprise

904
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,280
so

905
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,359
it's interesting because i would say

906
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,400
that a ceo's job is

907
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,400
a hundred percent of the time to be

908
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,040
always raising money right you are

909
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,680
always hunting for cash from the moment

910
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,880
you start

911
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,599
till the day you exit you are in a

912
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,599
constant search for money

913
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:54,640
and so

914
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,640
on a practical level

915
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,599
you know

916
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,280
the money is different when you are

917
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,960
pre-product

918
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,880
the money is different when you have a

919
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,280
product but your pre-market and the

920
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,520
money is different when you are in

921
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,160
market right you when you are when you

922
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,480
have a half-dozen customers and you have

923
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,119
proved out the product then the kind of

924
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,599
money you're raising is money

925
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,920
to ramp the business up and go to market

926
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,240
right so that's a bigger raise

927
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,040
but

928
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,640
you're looking for money early and the

929
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,680
money rounds have changed when i started

930
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,320
a series a round right you would have a

931
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,880
pre-seed maybe a seed round and then a

932
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,359
series a and a series a was three to

933
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,440
five million dollars and then once you

934
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,680
were and that was i have a product but

935
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,359
i'm just testing the market i haven't

936
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,280
got my pitch yet

937
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,440
and then when you a series b would be

938
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,160
going to market right i am now ready i

939
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,920
need to ramp up sales and marketing and

940
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,520
that might be a 20 million round but

941
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,880
today

942
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,000
today

943
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,320
a seed or pre-seed round can be three to

944
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,760
five million dollars the money has

945
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,240
gotten bigger so i would say from day

946
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,240
one you are looking to capital the

947
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,920
question is where are you looking to

948
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,079
capital day one you might not be looking

949
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,240
for a tier one vc

950
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,000
right you you're looking for angel

951
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,400
investors you're looking to do instead

952
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,440
of an equity-based round a note a

953
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,440
convertible capped note uh or safe note

954
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,359
right i'll pause there because that's

955
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:23,359
probably more than you i want to get

956
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:26,400
more questions than if there are

957
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,680
the last one

958
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,440
what is the key to dealing with the

959
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,200
rapid advancement of technology

960
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,680
so that's interesting because

961
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,560
you know you the we as you saw in some

962
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,280
of our pivots right the technology was

963
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,440
changing on us fast and it was so

964
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,359
fundamental to us

965
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,760
because when i started

966
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,240
we didn't have the docker and management

967
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,680
platforms available on aws that made

968
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,720
possible what our product actually was

969
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,319
right we could not have done what we did

970
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:02,720
when we started right when we started

971
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,560
the technology wasn't there

972
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,119
and if we weren't paying attention if we

973
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,359
weren't looking at the advances in the

974
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:12,000
kubernetes platform aws began offering

975
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,760
in the docker capability and what it

976
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,800
could do

977
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,960
so that it became possible to do a

978
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,920
completely cloud-based remote browser on

979
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,359
the fly dynamically provisioned right

980
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:24,960
that so

981
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,119
staying on the edge of technology was

982
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,200
absolutely essential for us because it

983
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,160
led us

984
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,000
to pivot our product into something

985
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,560
brand new but it it was hard to do

986
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,200
because you get invested in your product

987
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,359
right you've i've spent a million

988
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,440
dollars and two years of my life

989
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,160
building something on oracle virtualbox

990
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,960
oh my god am i going to start over

991
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,760
so understanding

992
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,079
the leaps in technology and the the

993
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,520
changes in

994
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,520
the frameworks the availability of

995
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,880
services the capabilities out there

996
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,040
you know is was absolutely essential but

997
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,040
making a hard decision

998
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,119
about when that advancement of

999
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,920
technology is sufficient so that you

1000
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,079
need to really fundamentally rethink

1001
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,680
your approach

1002
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,359
you know that's tough right and that

1003
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,040
comes down to the same things we think

1004
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,040
about around technical debt

1005
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,400
and i i'm a fierce believer in buying

1006
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,640
down technical debt and sometimes

1007
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,880
re-platforming and

1008
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,599
you know that i i i think that's

1009
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:32,400
essential um so and it's a cost and it's

1010
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,560
a risk but um

1011
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,079
you know you know you got to make good

1012
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,400
decisions and you hopefully have a cto

1013
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,960
where you're good enough to know

1014
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,640
what's real and what's not real what's

1015
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,880
important and what's not important what

1016
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,440
fundamentally changes your use case and

1017
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,760
what doesn't right

1018
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,560
okay thank you very much for your time

1019
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,599
for your knowledge uh for talking about

1020
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:57,280

this great technology

1029
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,160
you know what do we do to bring it to

1030
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,319
the market to get people to use it to

1031
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,960
monetize it how do we get rewarded for

1032
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,119
our work how do we change the lives of

1033

1034

building at the end of the day

1035
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,960
