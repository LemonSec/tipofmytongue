1
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,110
and we are back as I told you it

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,670
was not a long time exactly three

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:12,809
minutes that they have to wait between

4
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:14,160
space and space to be able to share

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,540
with us and continue with regional

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,779
north here in 8.8 computer security

7
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:21,930
conference that already fulfills eight months

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,880
running doing conferences every

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,189
almost every week  content every

10
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:27,270
week actually because we

11
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,070
have half we have clips and so we have the

12
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,419
conferences that are

13
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:33,200
widely no 828 dot org we have

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,130
different activities sometimes

15
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,390
we put out promotions of very

16
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,860
interesting workshops you can also report

17
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,120
on the page and on the page through

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,340
that  and we also have an online store

19
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,270
so that you can purchase

20
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,170
merchandising books and everything you need

21
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,940
to feel like a hacker environment as

22
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,670
god commands it as you should as

23
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,140
chrome actually commands it as dean

24
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,410
commands it so you can be there and enjoy your

25
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,360
own culture  his own industry

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,030
which he works in and in which 8.8 deals with

27
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,760
i  r expanding to a more audience more public

28
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,559
and try to insert in the

29
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,810
daily culture in the word cybersecurity for

30
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,400
that we are going to continue then with

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,480
our dear

32
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,160
is that I have made today's agenda

33
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,080
remember that you can participate if you are

34
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,600
registered in the chat of

35
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,340
8.8 in peace line you can participate to

36
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,690
win times that are hours of

37
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,190
consultation to buy talk with

38
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,630
different characters even with chema

39

because we will have the presence

43
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,760
of some of the  founders of wulff cop who

44
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,590
is with us don francisco belt

45
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,630

the time with us we have a

51
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,680
space for us to talk

52
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,450
about vulnerability hunters is something  that you dominate

53
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,450
widely and that in these times

54
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,590
especially with the pandemic must have

55
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,080
grown  The rate of

56
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,210
characters who are looking for where or the

57
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,290
small byway where to try to

58
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,730
get into, I am going to leave you the complete battle,

59

63
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,420
because  there are many thanks well again

64
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,860
thank you very much for the invitation as

always a pleasure to be here I am a big

66
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,980
fan of 8.8 so thank you very much

67
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,620
good my presentation today I am going to

68
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,930
talk a little

69
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,530
passing the

70
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,430
vulnerability hunter where am I going to be

71
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,950
talking a little  of the bug

72
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,620
bounty programs talking a little about what

73
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,330
is happening today about that

74
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,390
and an introduction from me and I will also

75
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,410
be sharing some

76
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,930
vulnerabilities of the things that I was

77
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,490
doing so that you can also

78
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,470
see more technical things for those who

79
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,480
like the more technical things for those

80
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,800
who are already aware of what

81
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,900
programs are and how they work  In the

82
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,050
first part it was a bit like you

83
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,670
already knew all the information but

84
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,980
please be patient that in the end you will

85
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,960
be able to see more entertaining things well

86
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,900
I will tell you a bit about the bug bounty programs it

87
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,600
is a new way or well it

88
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,550
is not new but  In Chile, at least,

89
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:18,300
looking for vulnerabilities, already looking for

90
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,280
vulnerabilities in a different way from

91
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,800
the one previously searched,

92
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,690
hunting vulnerabilities through

93
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,850
programs and bounty, a

94
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,070
different method was used called the crowdsourcing method,

95
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,160
which is an

96
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,140
open collaboration instructed by the seminars

97
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,580
Open tasks that consists of

98
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,470
examining traditional tasks

99
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,930
performed by employees or contractors,

100
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,100
leaving it in charge of a large group of

101
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,800
people of faith or of a community

102
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,500
through an open call

103
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,210
, which means that

104
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,330
crowdsourcing, for example, would be

105
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,100
a company that  pays drivers

106
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,260
to take trips every time they

107
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,030
have a race to them  e they are paid

108
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,390
a reward or a payment for doing these

109
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,060
uber trips, the huber application

110
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,700
works with a crowdsourcing model, and it

111
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,530
is like to go a little dimensioning

112
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,320
how these crowdsourcing applications work

113
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,320
and

114
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,410
in 2016 this crowdsourcing method began to be

115
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,380
applied to what  what is cybersecurity and

116
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,640
now I am going to start to explain a

117
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,500
little the results it has had and how

118
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,490
the industry has changed

119
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,690
well here we have crowdsourcing that

120
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,430
would come from hundreds of the

121
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,980
cyber community like

122
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,820
bug bounty hunter or few

123
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,880
cybersecurity researchers then we have  to the

124
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,910
company that works with their system, their

125
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,070
platform, everything

126
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:50,220
and then we have the intermediary that

127
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,330
unites these companies with the

128
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,650
crowdsourcing community to be able to

129
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,120
evaluate the things that are found or

130
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,169
good because in this case vulnerabilities

131
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:08,789
good and that drives the community to

132
00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:10,169
get involved  well what drives the

133
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:12,330
community are the rewards and the

134
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,949
rewards that in this case of book

135
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:15,449
bou  nty would be due to

136
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:18,240
vulnerabilities that is, every time

137
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,029
you find a vulnerability

138
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:22,409
depending on the impact it

139
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:26,029
has, you will be paid a reward

140
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:30,300
and that is what drives the athletic

141
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,759
hacker to look for vulnerabilities in it

142
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,800
in this model that I am mentioning to

143
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,289
you.  which is bot bounty

144
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:41,949
and well here we can see that as we

145
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:43,839
follow all the rules here we can see

146
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:47,039
the duck that took the reward

147
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,650
and do what I told you before

148
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,110
that the higher the impact of

149
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,630
vulnerabilities in the boxing world

150
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,930
Bounty normally pays better and this

151
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,510
is what encourages people to

152
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,060
go further to invest more hours of

153
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,460
work and look for vulnerabilities

154
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,760
after cutting them so that they can be

155
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,280
patched

156
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,440
and well, how did the bug

157
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,900
bounty start because I am

158
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,460
here talking about him

159
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,070
well now well this part good in the

160
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,810
book town programs and the first one that is

161
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,780
his creed his first down program and it was

162
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:29,340
in skate  In 1995 they

163
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,770
started putting the security

164
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,840
of their browser as you can see an

165
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,389
old version but they were the

166
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:38,190
pioneers who started this

167
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,650
bounty program inviting the

168
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,840
community

169
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,820
to look for vulnerabilities in their system

170
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,480
at the time this was  very different from

171
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,860
what people were normally doing,

172
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,440
which are the traditional hacker ethics

173
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,220
that xuxa donors

174
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,890
in 2004,

175
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,890
nine years later netscape created a

176
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,340
book bounty program for firefox

177
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:07,030
now and this was also very big they were

178
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,420
paying rewards from 500 to 500

179
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,770
dollars

180
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,630
to anyone  hacker who can find

181
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,400
a vulnerability in his system or that is

182
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,190
very attractive sir, it was already in 2004 and he

183
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,260
would have seen that firefox was paying

184
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,310
money to search for vulnerabilities

185
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,980
and would add called high attention and

186
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,250
also in 2000 in 2004 it was a

187
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,080
long time ago of verón  there has been a

188
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,940
lot of vulnerability at that time having

189
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,670
been easy to find is good they were

190
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,400
paying what  and it was already starting

191
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,260
later this was the part where I

192
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,440
got into in a certain way was when google

193
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,000
google after that created its program

194
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,270
but also where to pay a

195
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:52,140
reward of between 5 to 20 thousand dollars and

196
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,420
well this was the program that I

197
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,220
really  I already knew what it was

198
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,390
from the cybersecurity world I

199
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:01,050
knew about some types of errors but I

200
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,880
really did not believe so much the story

201
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,850
that I was good or that I

202
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,100
could really find something

203
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,070
in 2010 I find that Google is

204
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,500
paying for vulnerabilities  and I say wow

205
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,080
interesting this was a little unaware of

206
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,570
what it was about so this

207
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,490
week I started looking for vulnerabilities

208
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,950
in google

209
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:26,460
and I found things and sent them to him and that

210
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,990
's when I started paying the first

211
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,450
reward so in 2010 was

212
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,490
when google  He launched his program just

213
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,909
though and I found out about it and well I

214
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:37,620
think a lot of people did too, but

215
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,390
here it was like the boom that when Google

216
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,370
created its program even though it really did.  nte the

217
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,270
industry changed

218
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,730
later in 2011

219
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,090
on facebook, it followed in the footsteps of google and

220
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,860
created a book down program with

221
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,770
minimum rewards of $ 500 and without

222
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,060
a maximum cap,

223
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,180
this also happened in competition

224
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,590
to other companies that are

225
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:03,230
book down and to  be more attractive and to

226
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:07,730
date facebook has already paid 9.8

227
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,980
million dollars in rewards to

228
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,590
people around the world, being one

229
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:16,400
of them I also include myself and in the

230
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,890
course of just the course of

231
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,810
2019 so that they have an idea of how it

232
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,990
works  This system in the radios that

233
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,610
received a total of 15 thousand

234
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,880
security reports during the year 2019 for

235
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,600
carrying only 1,300

236
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,780
reports were paid

237
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,780
to people and people from 60

238
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,660
different countries

239
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,480
participated, a lot of people from

240
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,760
different countries participated all this energy all

241
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,990
these people  they started looking for

242
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,390
vulnerabilities on facebook and

243
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,460
facebook rewarded people who

244
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,470
managed to find

245
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,330
valid vulnerabilities must for  What I see here were

246
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,750
1,300,300 security researchers,

247
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,520


248
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:05,170
so this gives us a like a small

249
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:09,520
overview of the impact and how

250
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,110
effective these programs of the human mind are

251
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,840
, really very creative,

252
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,560
in 2016 the US Department of

253
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,070
Defense was the  pioneer in creating the

254
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:24,430
reward pilot that was called hack the

255
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:28,060
pentagon hack the pentagon since it was

256
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,850
one of the programs that was the first

257
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,560
program that has been made in history

258
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,820
where a government gets into the world of

259
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,550
the browns and they

260
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:42,070
hire these services and  They start to

261
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:45,010
work with this model now because I

262
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:48,690
share this with you because really in the

263
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,670
past, it is to hack the pentagon,

264
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:54,400
imagine something super illegal or one

265
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,910
would be afraid to try it because

266
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,290
normally if one is not authorized to

267
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:02,260
look for vulnerabilities than something

268
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,410
basically illegal then here the same

269
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,660
pentagon inviting you to  look for

270
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,640
vulnerabilities to your system

271
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,580
through these down programs and it was something

272
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,950
very attractive to have the author  ization

273
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,810
to be able to do it and let's not forget that

274
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,180
they are paying rewards

275
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,700
the individual payments range between

276
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,130
100 to 15 thousand dollars for a

277
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,830
vulnerability that is, you find four

278
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,020
vulnerabilities of fifteen thousand dollars and they

279
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,279
already have a good sum of

280
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:35,249
good money in the defense department of

281
00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:38,459
To date, the United States has processed more than

282
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:40,889
11,000 good vulnerabilities

283
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:44,220
discovered by researchers. 11,000

284
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,470
vulnerabilities is a lot of

285
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,610
information,

286
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,649
this is also ours so that you can see in

287
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:53,629
the capacity it has to search

288
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:56,069
for vulnerabilities so that I can

289
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:57,360
show you a little more details of

290
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,100
how this was  program so that

291
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,910
people become more familiar with

292
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,180
this

293
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,160
where good when this program was created

294
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,480
down and called pentagon hack

295
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,139
to date it took 13 minutes to get the

296
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:14,579
first vulnerability after

297
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:16,829
launch that is, the

298
00:12:16,829 --> 00:12:19,390
public response is very fast

299
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:22,690
200 reports in 6 hours were

300
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,520
immediate immediately after the

301
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,970
launch  nto that is, 200 security reports were also sent

302
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:30,580
during the first six hours

303
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,160
, which is

304
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,000
crazy too and the hackers who were

305
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,390
invited or registered were 1400 old

306
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,550
than the one subscribed to participate in the

307
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:46,030
program, those 1,400 10 hackers were

308
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,980
the ones who sent this for  One hundred report

309
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,550
in the first six hours and during the

310
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,590
course of what they have already paid, they have

311
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,990
paid 75 thousand dollars in rewards

312
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,120
paid for all the report in the

313
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,880
legitimate one, that is, many of these

314
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,290
reports that were sent, for example of

315
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:05,080
these 200 reports, not all of them  They were

316
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,000
valid, not all of them had a

317
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,150
real impact for the pentagon, but of these 200,

318
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,460
within the first six women, there

319
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,410
were valid reports, which

320
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:18,960
rewarded and after this important lady, it

321
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,180
should be noted that many

322
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,650
more reports arrived and to this day

323
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,420
these continue to arrive.  programs are

324
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,760
kept in an old way and

325
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,360
continuously running on these

326
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,500
book down platforms and already bu  Eno and the

327
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,780
pentagon when he did a pentagon hack

328
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,700
it did so well with this initiative that they

329
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,110
created other branches of the other branches

330
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,540
of the government they also wanted to join

331
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:48,690
and that is where the army entered the air force the

332
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:52,650
air force and they created their bats for

333
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:54,120
all their  different programs and

334
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,620
currently these are programs that

335
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,690
are working and that people are

336
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,130
looking for vulnerabilities and already

337
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,280
patched thousands of vulnerabilities

338
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,220
through the crowdsourcing community

339
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:08,160
and it is also important to emphasize

340
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,319
I would think about it because the US government

341
00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:12,389
that is doing truck down programs

342
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:14,550
and only  They would be inviting people from the United States, it

343
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,490
is like the most logical thing, but it is not the

344
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:22,259
case, they are inventing hackers from 50

345
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:26,279
different countries including India,

346
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:31,220
Richard, Pakistan, the Philippines, Egyptian,

347
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:34,680
Russia, France, Australia and Canada, that is,

348
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,439
imagine the Russians are looking for

349
00:14:37,439 --> 00:14:39,930
vulnerabilities in the Pentagon and they

350
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,779
are being paid  for this reason or as

351
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,870
to show you a little the scope that

352
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:48,720
this company or inst  Ituations are so

353
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,819
concerned about vulnerabilities that they

354
00:14:50,819 --> 00:14:52,450
are even

355
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:55,880
willing to pay a Russian to

356
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,280
tell them where the error is and pay

357
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,040
him for it. It is important to tell him that it is

358
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,250
much better to worry, much better to

359
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,010
find out about a vulnerability when

360
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,630
someone is warning themselves in a good way.

361
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:11,330
You have to find out why, Jewish, why

362
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,250
an attack occurred, so here what we

363
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,810
are trying to mitigate is a

364
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,270
possible real attack, so so that

365
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:20,990
this does not happen at risk, governments

366
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,430
are taking the risk of including

367
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,320
people from other countries, which I

368
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,940
find very attractive.

369
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,840
Well continuing a little

370
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,790
here I show you a little the costs of

371
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,710


372
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:37,680
what this cost to the United States Secretary

373
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,170
of Defense, which was crankcase yachts, they

374
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,110
were the main

375
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,520
promoters of this book pound program

376
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,700
and the United States government and here

377
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,740
is saying  that they had hired

378
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,800
a normal company is going to be ethical,

379
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,730
normal hacking would have cost

380
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:58,610
more than u  n million dollars

381
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,740
and occupying this crowdsourcing system

382
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,170
of it where they are simply

383
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,910
paying for the vulnerabilities that

384
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,779
they want they

385
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:11,390
paid 150 thousand dollars

386
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:14,780
and there they can see 50 per 150 thousand dollars

387
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,760
I do not know the cost that they had to

388
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,710
pay to patch these vulnerabilities

389
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:23,900
for  discovering them was much lower than

390
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,700
it would have cost hiring a

391
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,460
hacker ethic an ethic traditional hacking

392
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,410
where one against a

393
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,350
firm has 56 people and one looking for

394
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:37,220
vulnerabilities so bug bounty is

395
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,420
cheaper it has more scope

396
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:44,420
and clear and costs less then  That

397
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,550
is also important to

398
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:50,500
mention because

399
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:54,110
I am going to continue very attractive and here we can see the

400
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,630
companies that are offering these are

401
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,730
the main book bounty companies

402
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:01,250
today that are offering a

403
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,620
soccer program and for hackers so that they

404
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,309
can look for vulnerabilities and also

405
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:09,410
inviting companies  so that they can

406
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:12,470
test their safety and these are the

407
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,959
four main  cipales since I am going to

408
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,849
talk to you about puszkow where I am the

409
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:19,250
creator of this platform we work

410
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,900
with a team with chili peppers and I am going to

411
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,309
tell you a little about what this is about and

412
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:24,890
how it works but it is important to

413
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,079
rule out that these are the main companies

414
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,119


415
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:30,760
and  They are the ones that have changed

416
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,640
the bug bounty industry at the moment

417
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,010
and here well comes a bit of

418
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,890
my presentation because apart from being

419
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,230
in the middle of this whole world of bounty pop,

420
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,360
developing platforms and all this

421
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,170
too I am a bounty hunter for a

422
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,930
long year and I  It fascinates so this was

423
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,560
what also motivated me to

424
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,690
dedicate myself this professionally.

425
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:59,040
Take them out.I am going to show you a little who

426
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,930
I

427
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:03,240
am what I do and one of the things

428
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,860
that I have already discovered that I can

429
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,840
make public about because obviously in this

430
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,060
world  of cybersecurity almost all the

431
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,710
work we do is in a certain way

432
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,930
secret and we cannot share our

433
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,060
findings of our discoveries

434
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,680
but in some cases when the client tells

435
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,770
you  It allows it, it can be made public

436
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:22,500
so I'm going to share some of that

437
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,040
perfect instance with you, well, when I

438
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,970
started Google programs,

439
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,820
as I was saying before,

440
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,160
Google started its bus count program and I was

441
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,990
really not sure if it  I could

442
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,200
do but I said, look, I don't lose anything, I

443
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,360
like cybersecurity, I'm sure,

444
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,670
vulnerabilities, so the worst

445
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:47,640
thing I can lose is my time.

446
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,290


447
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:52,320


448
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,940


449
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,760
In a wall of fame,

450
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,100
apart from being paid with money, they pay you

451
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,340
with a reputation in a certain way and

452
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,110
here we can see some of the walls

453
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,150
from fame in which I am, of

454
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,470
which I have contributed with

455
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,540
security, we can see each double

456
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,300
microsoft  and meo

457
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,160
freelancer black forum yahoo google

458
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,790
paypal snap chat twitter target woman and

459
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:22,770
joe and telecom and this is among some of

460
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,420
the ones you can put because really already

461
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,030
with  over the years I have forgotten a bit about

462
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,130
all the parts that I am in, but I

463
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,030
think these are more or less the

464
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:33,180
main ones and well, vulnerabilities were being searched

465
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,890
through this

466
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,230
crowdsourcing system to all these

467
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,710
companies

468
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:43,150
so that they can find real cases of

469
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:47,000
vulnerabilities  And of findings that I have

470
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,720
already found in these things, good not

471
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,559
only recently because as I told you, they

472
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,240
are things that I cannot tell much about the

473
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,530
current situation, but I think

474
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,360
that here it can be well illustrated what

475
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,280
companies are looking for and how they

476
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,730
reward you, it arrives here  for example the

477
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:07,730
down program and yahoo and adjusted

478
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,100
offering

479
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,990
in a back down program they are

480
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:14,059
telling you we want them to tell us about

481
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:15,320
any vulnerability they find

482
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,720
on our system and here I found

483
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,520
that

484
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,590
yahoo is offering a system

485
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:24,020
called yahoo webmaster which was a

486
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,970
system  so that people could

487
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,490
create their web pages on

488
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:31,190
yahoo servers in this case it was a wordpress

489
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,620
It was so that one can create a blog and

490
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,650
all this is in yahoo gives you a server

491
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,690
that already had wordpress set up and you

492
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,340
all I had to do was add the

493
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,860


494
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,940
perfect content I bought an account in yahoo

495
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,250
I installed this wordpress that I

496
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,470
it happened yahoo and I do not have to down here

497
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,830
as all wordpress had a

498
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:56,730
question to send me a message and

499
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:59,530
seeing this version of wordpress I noticed

500
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:02,620
that it had versions installed

501
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,870
that were vulnerable to the

502
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,940
execution rhythm that would be a code

503
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,929


504
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:13,000
of network execution disputes  remote and this I

505
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,830
put the code in the

506
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,430
messages area I

507
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:19,020
managed to trigger this remote

508
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,290
network execution code

509
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:23,910
and here to demonstrate a little

510
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:27,030
the impact I used the current version of php

511
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:29,070
that they were using in yahoo to load

512
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,170
these servers

513
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:33,570
and here you can see the  script where the

514
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:36,390
blog appears and at the bottom of the message area there is

515
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,160
a square that has nothing to do

516
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,580
with what appears and there is the version

517
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,640
of php

518
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,440
information well me  here I can do

519
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,540
anything to have extracted

520
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,570
file sent file or right

521
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,310
anything I had direct access to the

522
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:56,520
server so I actually

523
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,740
discovered this I realized that it is a

524
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,650
finding so I generated a report to

525
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,620


526
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,700
yahoo I wrote them this yahoo and

527
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:11,030
they ask me here that he  They tell me

528
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,700
that the error has already been cleared and that

529
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,930
please check if I cannot

530
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:17,170
reproduce it and that they will see if this is

531
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,750
eligible for a payment five days later

532
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,930
they tell me Francisco that you won one thousand thousand

533
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:26,600
thousand dollars this would normally have

534
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,650
been out of the scoop

535
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:32,280
But but we found that this must be

536
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,920
paid for clearly they had to pay for it

537
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,540
because it was a high

538
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,950
impact vulnerability so it is not convenient

539
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:41,130
for them to leave this open and they gave me the

540
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,630
reward of a thousand dollars and olive tree

541
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,910
thank you team if it was a good find

542
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:49,320
thanks again  and here I had this

543
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,880
reward

544
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,040
now as to go to another case I am going to

545
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:57,500
show you a case of google and where

546
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,990
in this case google has a system that

547
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:03,870
It's called fire fire, you see it has a system

548
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:06,120
that uses vdv to load

549
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,360
different projects now and here I discovered

550
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,640
that if I put this attack code

551
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,920
which is a cross site scripting and

552
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,710
put it in the title of the project kaka you

553
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:20,520
can see it well  as I put an image

554
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,600
of jackson with a javascript inserted and at the

555
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,190
moment of starting to process these

556
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:29,670
pages later as you can see here

557
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:32,880
in the title above it appears that this

558
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,820
image is loading

559
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:39,320
or my html or javascript code is

560
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,690
being triggered in the part  where the

561
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,639
name of the project goes in the

562
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:46,790
upper left corner

563
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:49,640
and down here we can see the console that

564
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,670
can see the code that I had put

565
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:56,510
is written correctly and the

566
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:59,510
system is not valid nor did it try to me that

567
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,400
this image will not be displayed in a certain

568
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,280
way here  In this case, express scripts are not triggered

569
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,560
because google implements

570
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,260
other security methods so

571
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,870
that javascript does not load but already with

572
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:15,260
the pure fact of injecting html code into the

573
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,270
c  Ontents

574
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:20,810
of google that is already enough proof

575
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:23,090
for me to be in a reward for

576
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:25,490
this vulnerability not necessarily

577
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:27,320
to trigger the javascript but to

578
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,820
demonstrate that it cannot inject

579
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,100
code again this is a type of

580
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,140
vulnerability of all those that can

581
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,510
be reported there are  Scripting is one of

582
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,710
the easiest to find if you

583
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,920
ask me, well here work is being

584
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,780
punished, we can see the

585
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,389
terminal

586
00:24:43,389 --> 00:24:46,269
and here from command it reports one the same as

587
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:48,309
I did with yahoo and google answers me

588
00:24:48,309 --> 00:24:49,659
after a certain number of days here

589
00:24:49,659 --> 00:24:52,539
we can but  It was 11 days it makes me nice

590
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:54,849
cats good catch we have filled out a

591
00:24:54,849 --> 00:24:57,309
report on this and we will let you know

592
00:24:57,309 --> 00:25:00,009
when we have more information what

593
00:25:00,009 --> 00:25:02,379
there is is that

594
00:25:02,379 --> 00:25:04,719
it sounds good it seems that they liked what

595
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:06,140
I send

596
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:10,010
and they spend a few days later,

597
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,170
thank you for your  report as part of

598
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:14,480
the google rewards program the

599
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,929
panel to that video give you 5000 dollars it

600
00:25:17,929 --> 00:25:20,389
is important that if you are not registered

601
00:25:20,389 --> 00:25:22,399
as a distributor that  register well

602
00:25:22,399 --> 00:25:24,769
that and another issue to get paid but

603
00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:26,960
I am registered as a

604
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,169
google distributor and they gave me this

605
00:25:30,169 --> 00:25:31,690
reward of

606
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:35,840
five thousand dollars and of course for me I

607
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,039
think this was one of my first

608
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,230
rewards that I have earned and it was

609
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,019
for  I was super emotional and this

610
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:44,740
really gave me high confidence in myself

611
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:47,659
to continue looking for this type of

612
00:25:47,659 --> 00:25:49,759
vulnerability and I said well maybe I

613
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:53,119
could dedicate myself to this now and I show you this a bit

614
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:55,840
so that you can see the process

615
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,580
that the vulnerability when I discovered it

616
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:02,320
And as I took action to be able to be

617
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,200
rewarded for it

618
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,080
and well this is the last case that I

619
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,300
am going to show you since it is a case that

620
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,980
many companies were

621
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:18,530
affected, it is important to say that when

622
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,880
one finds a vulnerability in a

623
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,890
company like Oracle, they

624
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:24,380
are companies  they have many services

625
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,940
that almost all other companies use,

626
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:31,220
for example e-mail subject databases, there

627
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,530
are many third-party services,

628
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:36,800
very large companies  occupy and now how to

629
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,090
read what these services give you then

630
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:40,670
finding a century day in an

631
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:43,760
oracle application can have a very

632
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,310
large impact on the whole world since I

633
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,750
am going to show you a vulnerability that had a

634
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:51,620
very large impact as you can see here

635
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,480
I  Through this vulnerability that

636
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,460
I found, it was not goal that I was able to extract

637
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,760
files from the linkedin google server

638
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,900
of united airlines from here and

639
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,030
well and many more this is just an

640
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:07,790
example of how I discovered this

641
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,460
vulnerability and how I got to hack the

642
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,240
whole company

643
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,550
as you  I was commenting when these

644
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,559
companies occupy the same service in

645
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,630
this case all these companies were

646
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,940
occupying an oracle service and I

647
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,080
found this vulnerability that

648
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,700
affected oracle then

649
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,309
automatically I knew and not only

650
00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:27,750
now that it was being affected but

651
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,280
that all the companies that were

652
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,380
occupying  this service and I began to

653
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,090
investigate and indeed this was the

654
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,140
case

655
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,340
now I show you more information than

656
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,429
It took how I discovered this

657
00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:40,500
note that facebook was sending me an

658
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:46,260
email to my mail with an email that was

659
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,390
facebook

660
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:52,380
mail.com it was my facebook mail.com as

661
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,429
we do not make contact

662
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,450
m.facebook.com to get this

663
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,340
notification to my email I say and close

664
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,490
this  subdomain is facebook

665
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:04,050
mail.com so I grabbed this

666
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:07,370
subdomain

667
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:10,440
of ns wines and saw that the domain was

668
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,059
connected to this system called

669
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:15,179
response ist and I started to investigate and of

670
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:17,540
course in an interesting oracle system

671
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,890
I started to get a little bit

672
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:21,800
more and

673
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,830
I began to realize that I could

674
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:29,400
extract files through the

675
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,400
parameter to the vulnerable parameters

676
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,929
that I had already found at the beginning

677
00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:36,300
between this vulnerability in a company

678
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,660
in the link and the tenant said on

679
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,580
facebook originally

680
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,560
and when I discovered this vulnerability and

681
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,350
I managed  extract the archived from facebook

682
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:49,110
began to investigate clearly where

683
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,150
this system comes from, where does this

684
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:53,040
facebook really come from, facebook is going to

685
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,680
fix this vulnerability  dy is and there

686
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,480
I started to investigate and looked for the same

687
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,310
parameters that I was using on facebook

688
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,770
and I realized that of course many other

689
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:03,120
companies were using the same

690
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,130
parameters and here we can see was

691
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:08,520
linkedin passion new look in silver

692
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,760
monkey and animoto and good and different

693
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,100
companies

694
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,570
then I began to apply the same

695
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:17,870
attack code that I was using on

696
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:21,020
facebook and I began to get

697
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,340
files of all this from this entire

698
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:26,220
company here we are going to see an example of

699
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,970
how the attack worked we can see the

700
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:32,010
linkedin dotcom

701
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:34,920
efe sf slats and there I  I put my attack code

702
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,540


703
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:39,110
where it was to ask for the file I wanted is

704
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,720
searched twice and it was very important to

705
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,210
put the correct parameters

706
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:48,060
for the attack to work so

707
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,790
it was not loading anything or it will be a

708
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,500
mixture of mixing the parameters

709
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,160
with the attack code and  These same

710
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,660
parameters and this same code were

711
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,730
used for all the

712
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,050
companies that were using this

713
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:05,490
service, I obviously saw  This with all

714
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:09,360
the information well and I send you

715
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,240
a report for

716
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,690
now,

717
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:15,720
eat, he answers me, Francisco tells me

718
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,100
that we want to congratulate

719
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:24,600
we are going to upload a patch

720
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,520
to all the people who are

721
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,730
occupying this this system could of

722
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,410
this vulnerability and has  been fixed

723
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:33,390
and we are going to put you on our wall of

724
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:36,660
fame it puts me and they also accompanied me

725
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,870
a good reward and good and that

726
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:42,510
was the way they threw this

727
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,640
vulnerability at me, important to mention that

728
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,410
in this case because the vulnerability

729
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:48,600
is located in the  cloud

730
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,030
the patch did not have to be applied to

731
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:54,390
each device individually

732
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:57,500
but rather uploading a patch to the cloud and

733
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,190
automatically all the devices

734
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,260
that were connecting to it were

735
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,330
patched is one of the benefits

736
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:05,549
that the cloud has and in this case

737
00:31:05,549 --> 00:31:09,520
as an account

738
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,200
And

739
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,450
now I want to show you the platform

740
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:14,830
I am looking for, which is the one we are

741
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,750
developing here in Chile with a team

742
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,240
of programmers and I love them  leave

743
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,100
guests because to see how

744
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,710
these book down companies are mentioning them before

745
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:25,000
and they work through the

746
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,450
community and here we are looking for,

747
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:31,450
we are inviting the community to register with

748
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:34,570
us and currently

749
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:37,860
we already have more than 1000 hackers registered

750
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,690
when hackers or ethics  The hacker

751
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,370
enrolls in the platform, they have to

752
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:44,010
fill out a questionnaire,

753
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:47,400
first sign some documents,

754
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,720
accept our terms of conditions,

755
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,610
and once they pass a validation process, they

756
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:54,460
can just enter the

757
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,250
platform and in the book brown

758
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,160
tics programs that we are offering, it is

759
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,030
important to mention  that many of these

760
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:03,310
book mans programs are private

761
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:06,430
therefore try to collect points and that is

762
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,870
going to be they have been invited to these

763
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:09,520
bounty programs that are a little more

764
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,669
private

765
00:32:11,669 --> 00:32:13,899
we look for when we create the

766
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:17,080
platform the first thing we choose

767
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,969
before having clients or  before

768
00:32:18,969 --> 00:32:22,269
testing the safety of other people we

769
00:32:22,269 --> 00:32:23,379
do not want to test the safety

770
00:32:23,379 --> 00:32:25,359
our own platform so in

771
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:28,389
2017 we created our own doc

772
00:32:28,389 --> 00:32:31,450
town tea program where we paid rewards between

773
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:35,409
50 to 350 dollars and invited everyone

774
00:32:35,409 --> 00:32:38,200
to register, that is, to

775
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,779
enter the website and register

776
00:32:40,779 --> 00:32:43,089
and look for vulnerabilities ourselves

777
00:32:43,089 --> 00:32:44,489
we are

778
00:32:44,489 --> 00:32:48,820
eager to see your reports and

779
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:51,700
creativity so of course he left you

780
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,619
all super invited to add

781
00:32:53,619 --> 00:32:56,200
dotcom bushes to our

782
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,419
public bounty program so that you can generate

783
00:32:58,419 --> 00:33:00,369
security reports and practice and

784
00:33:00,369 --> 00:33:01,899
search for vulnerabilities without having to

785
00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:04,080
worry about

786
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,489
declaring  That they are doing something wrong or

787
00:33:06,489 --> 00:33:09,399
nothing we want this and it

788
00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:12,179
is also as cordial guests

789
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:14,190
francisco thank you very much for that

790
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,360
presentation I have a couple of questions

791
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,059
that they are asking me but almost all of them

792
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:20,159
are about the issue of the low level of the

793
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,200
reward the first time they ask me

794
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,340
is what are the criteria to

795
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,450
select the hackers who can

796
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:27,210
obtain this or can access these

797
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:29,360
bo  nifications

798
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,120
for hackers so that those who

799
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,470
can register what are the

800
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,540
requirements

801
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,620
perfectly look at the moment

802
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,870
no requirement is required they have to

803
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,910
register on the website to sign

804
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,460
the documentation

805
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:46,370
read the documentation well

806
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:49,440
upload the documentation that we are

807
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,420
asking for and with that after  be

808
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:54,330
approved which can take between five to

809
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:56,820
fifteen days one is that they are approved and they

810
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,560
can enter the platform and with

811
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,170
that they are ready to search for

812
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:02,640
vulnerabilities so it is

813
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,430
relatively fast and nothing extra is required they

814
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:07,680
do not require a certificate or

815
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:11,130
pay to  Something does not come in no more and since they

816
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:12,870
are ready to make parts of the

817
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:13,949
community

818
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:15,690
hey sorry there is an indiscreet middle question

819
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:16,739
but I do not know if I have to

820
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:18,030
ask why being public

821
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:19,350
after the claims if the old question

822
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:21,210
says they ask how much was the reward

823
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:23,810
of  Now

824
00:34:23,859 --> 00:34:26,199
with me the truth I can not share it

825
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:28,210
but we can say that it was over

826
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:31,210
$ 10,000 because it was  one of the

827
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:34,029
biggest that I have won so if it is a

828
00:34:34,029 --> 00:34:36,129
reward even before well Diego is

829
00:34:36,129 --> 00:34:37,449
currently asking Chile they have

830
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:39,039
knowledge vision of the impact on

831
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:41,960
these methods of seeing the parts

832
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,349
very good question look at the truth is

833
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:47,929
that there is more and more awareness more and more

834
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:50,179
People are aware of this but it is

835
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:52,129
something new, it is already something that is

836
00:34:52,129 --> 00:34:53,719
doing to us as much as I would like

837
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:56,210
but if definitely something that is

838
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:57,740
beginning to be done and more and more

839
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:00,170
companies in Latin America are opting

840
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:02,200
for this new method of looking for

841
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,040
vulnerabilities, they

842
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,380
ask which one  It is the back found that makes

843
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,820
you the most proud

844
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:12,870
very good question look at me the truth is

845
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:14,730
day by day it reported many

846
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:17,090
vulnerabilities

847
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:20,220
I think that more than the vulnerability

848
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,440
that I like the most, it is the type of

849
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,390
vulnerability that I like the most

850
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,310
are injections.

851
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:28,650
I have really been passionate about databases

852
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:31,800
since I was a kid, I don't know why and I think

853
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,690
that all the vulnerability that

854
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:36,690
a base has to do with  data for me is this

855
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:37,760
important

856
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,320
perfect francisco asks what

857
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,790
knowledge is needed to

858
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:44,750
start the path of the backbone you

859
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,430
but hey what is needed

860
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:48,950
to start rope in the program in the

861
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:51,280
world of book bound and it really is

862
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,140
good to have a good disposition wanting to

863
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:57,680
learn  In I recommend reading many

864
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,160
papers looking for hackers who who

865
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,570
participate in the programs with bounty

866
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,250
many many of them many times

867
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:07,220
share the things they found as they

868
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:10,400
did in their blogs and I really

869
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,020
that was one of the things that

870
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,090
helped me to start if  They ask me

871
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:16,460
what is the best thing to definitely

872
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,920
look for information online papers and

873
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,260
seek the knowledge of the same hacker

874
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,510
who discovered the vulnerabilities that

875
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,770
helps a lot to discover new

876
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:26,309
techniques

877
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:29,099
to search for a back on a platform,

878
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:30,869
the owner must be informed behind these or

879
00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:33,569
there are problems  legal by means very

880
00:36:33,569 --> 00:36:36,900
good question if this is important that

881
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,880
they are clear never look for

882
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,890
vulnerabilities in a company that does not

883
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:43,769
authorize these tests and this can

884
00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:45,719
have a legal and negative impact for

885
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:48,059
you and they will really happen super

886
00:36:48,059 --> 00:36:49,890
unpleasant that it is not necessary

887
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:52,289
so always do tests in

888
00:36:52,289 --> 00:36:54,390
places that are not authorized to do them

889
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:57,599
that is why in the bug bounty programs they are

890
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,640
a key place so that you

891
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,109
can develop and look for

892
00:37:01,109 --> 00:37:02,249
vulnerabilities without having to

893
00:37:02,249 --> 00:37:04,229
worry about any problem

894
00:37:04,229 --> 00:37:06,900
or that someone has them because of death

895
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,020
in the future

896
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,140

897
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,819
fernando questions that

898
00:37:11,819 --> 00:37:13,980
vulnerabilities or attacks are really

899
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,930
presented through sites  web, what other way

900
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:17,549
could a company be attacked from

901
00:37:17,549 --> 00:37:18,690
cyberspace, protectors are asked

902
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,940
in the background if a very very good

903
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,519
question also good currently all

904
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:25,380
the things that it connects to the internet

905
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:28,640
can be vulnerable the question is

906
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,630
only some systems occupy

907
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,670
better systems than others but

908
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,140
really here  there may be

909
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,900
web applications mobile applications  The

910
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,730
infrastructures can be in software, it

911
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,650
can be hardware, it is connected in some

912
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:43,170
way, for example, entities with so

913
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:45,089
many hacking marta hacking how

914
00:37:45,089 --> 00:37:47,309
self it is, then really the

915
00:37:47,309 --> 00:37:49,230
spektrum of things that can be searched for

916
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:52,769
vulnerabilities is very wide if

917
00:37:52,769 --> 00:37:53,789
it is really impressive  We were

918
00:37:53,789 --> 00:37:55,859
then a couple of weeks ago with

919
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:59,160
Gabriel and we were surprised that there were in

920
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,510
villas specialized precisely in the

921
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,490
subject that is the ier in competition, it was a

922
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:04,079
capture the flash trying to axis it is

923
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,420
precisely to hack the systems of this

00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,880
car in two he asks hello to Pancho

925
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,410
It would be great that in the near future

926
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:12,480
the bulls programs with are

927
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,680
competitive with respect to other

928
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,509
platforms or we will have news of the

929
00:38:15,509 --> 00:38:17,869
vacancies it

930
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,570
would be great that in the near future

931
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,010
the boston programs are

932
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,390
competitive with respect to other

933
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:28,060
platforms or we will have news from the

934
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:30,100
box counter  from Chile ago is written

935
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,570
I think I imagine that it will refer

936
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:34,510
precisely to the plans  That they have with

937
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,580
the platform I am looking

938
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:39,460
good at the moment in the book

939
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:42,190
bus cook platform we are looking to expand

940
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,140
our community and currently we have

941
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,700
had very good results with the

942
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,940
community we have but if we want to

943
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:52,030
leave more we want to give more rewards

944
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:54,300
hopefully the hacking marathon where we can

945
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,290
to all people  What they are

946
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:58,540
starting is to be able to give

947
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,580
them a solid footing so that they can

948
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,960
start their

949
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,150
cybersecurity careers but if we want to enlarge

950
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:06,640
our community and be more

951
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,230
transparent as well and have and give

952
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,940
better rewards, that

953
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,920
is really what I am working for.  day by

954
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,810
day in order to really make the

955
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:16,210
rewards of I look bigger so

956
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:18,400
that hackers or ethical hackers have

957
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,800
greater incentive when looking for

958
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,050
vulnerability

josé francisco martínez asks a

960
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,340
group created to support education

961
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,270
precisely what you are communicating

962
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:29,800
publication of this to  continental level

963
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,140
America or Spanish would be interesting  e that

964
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,030
suddenly maybe if it does not exist or if it is not

965
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,560
within the idea of bulls as for

966
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:39,280
now generating some type of classrooms or

967
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,230
education system we could try to

968
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,730
see if we can organize something a 8.8

969
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:46,240
precisely to make November appro at

970
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,550
least start with a  interesting

971
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,870
funny foot to generate new hackers

972
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,640
could be an activation that we could

973
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,250
work together eventually yes

974
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,230
but actively it is something that I would

975
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:58,030
love to do everything that is to

976
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:00,010
share knowledge make

977
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:01,780
people more aware of all this is

978
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,010
something we want to do so

979
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:05,850
Yes, please, it would be very good to do that, we will

980
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:08,860
talk later, it seems to you for a

981
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,750
lot and more knowledge is required in

982
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:14,070
the rating style.

983
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:16,230


984
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:18,180

987
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,400
more knowledge is required

red team style red team sorry

989
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,770
i'm missing all the audio no  I

990
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:33,750
listen to what you are talking about

991
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:36,420
and how we do it I am going to repeat it for

992
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:39,150
back bounty more knowledge

993
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:42,290
of the tower team style is required

994
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:47,720
I am now not listening to you clearly the audio

995
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,610
enters me and it goes away like I heard you

996
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:52,040
suddenly the studio can do

997
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,160
something about it

998
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:57,140
The study what happens to see I am going to

999
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:59,000
ask again for back down and

1000
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,600
more knowledge is required rating style

1001
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:09,120
I heard that in the ring I do know if to be

1002
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,970
back down and more knowledge is required

1003
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,570
at the height of reptilian style

1004
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:16,590
Thank you very much until listen or

1005
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:17,780
really

1006
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,610
you just need to be creative and

1007
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:23,430
think outside the box you do not require

1008
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:25,110
a type

1009
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:28,590
of prior knowledge it is just

1010
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:30,780
good to know

1011
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:34,410
how the vulnerabilities work but I

1012
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:37,740
do not know but it does not require anything prior

1013
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,330
or we receive to have a

1014
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,310
cybersecurity team just be  creative

1015
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:43,410
and try to find vulnerabilities that

1016
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:46,119
have an impact on the company

1017
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:48,950
and I have one last question

1018
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:51,530
from francisco says namesake look he says have you got

1019
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:52,849
gone some bad personal experience

1020
00:41:52,849 --> 00:41:55,339
looking for the skills since you

1021
00:41:55,339 --> 00:41:56,480
mentioned earlier that you

1022
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,560
could not have a problem or less

1023
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,589
complicated of course do not look at the truth I have not

1024
00:42:00,589 --> 00:42:02,990
had problems personally but

1025
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:06,050
I have heard a lot of stories the bounty

1026
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:06,970
hunter

1027
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:09,500
in the hacking sea although he is hearing

1028
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,530
las vegas how we talk all heard

1029
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,900
art stories of the bounty hunter is

1030
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,849
that they have had problems when

1031
00:42:16,849 --> 00:42:18,589
reporting vulnerabilities thinking that

1032
00:42:18,589 --> 00:42:21,020
they are going to be given a reward and

1033
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,579
really the company does not take it so

1034
00:42:22,579 --> 00:42:24,079
well and you feel that they are being

1035
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,750
looted in a certain way  So I do

1036
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,869
not personally but if it

1037
00:42:28,869 --> 00:42:32,480
happens it happens but I have never heard a

1038
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,609
bad story in the world of the book

1039
00:42:34,609 --> 00:42:36,320
vaughn maybe never heard that a

1040
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,480
hacker has sent a report and

1041
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,490
has really had

1042
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:43,970
problems for doing it more than anything the

1043
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:45,589
problems that I heard is when

1044
00:42:45,589 --> 00:42:47,930
Someone sent a report to a company

1045
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:50,660
without them being aware that they are

1046
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:51,950
from people who  They are looking for

1047
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:54,690
vulnerabilities

1048
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:57,210
and the last question to Don Jorge, why does he

1049
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:58,619
ask a tool that is

1050
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:02,190
used to act in particular, well,

1051
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:03,170
mainly

1052
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:06,030
bersuit and it is on the main platform

1053
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:08,130
and I at least had room to

1054
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:09,930
intercept a packet this is for

1055
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:12,150
our applications  sources of

1056
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:14,000
web or mobile applications

1057
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,290
bersuit and some main applications

1058
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:18,390
that I occupy and also good I recommend everyone to

1059
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:20,700
learn to write in

1060
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:23,849
pakistan or bach or learn a

1061
00:43:23,849 --> 00:43:26,280
programming language because this helps a

1062
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,839
lot when wanting to create

1063
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:32,690
your own programs I

1064
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:34,680
highly recommend that studying

1065
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,470
programming  And

1066
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:40,020
also in occupying the program bro is one

1067
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,980
of the main ones that I occupy

1068
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,140
today in being blowing so that we have

1069
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,299
an open program for 8.8 in Burgos and

1070
00:43:48,299 --> 00:43:49,859
we are going to work on it to develop it

1071
00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:51,119
seems that the idea will be pleasant if you are going to have

1072
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,339
to openly talk dear

1073
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,809
Francisco because  it seems like it's a good

1074
00:43:54,809 --> 00:43:56,490
idea to start spawning new hackers

1075
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:58,500
for the community and the last one is if

1076
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,270
with these with this we close with this

1077
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:01,770
comment I want to thank you

1078
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:05,819
precisely for the time in the patience and

1079
00:44:05,819 --> 00:44:08,849
precisely all the ability to be able to

1080
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:10,499
transmit this knowledge with

1081
00:44:10,499 --> 00:44:13,380
us today here in 8.8

1082
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:16,559
north region francisco Thank you very much

1083
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:17,940
Thank you very much to you and well as soon as you

1084
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:20,039
want to meet me and if many

1085
00:44:20,039 --> 00:44:22,349
times for the invitation it is very good that you

1086
00:44:22,349 --> 00:44:24,539
are very well thank you very much for everything and

1087
00:44:24,539 --> 00:44:26,670
we continue with the panorama

1088
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:29,459
for today because it continues 8.8

1089
00:44:29,459 --> 00:44:32,239
northern regional we continue working

1090
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:34,829
for you with  information seeking to

1091
00:44:34,829 --> 00:44:36,539
centralize the information trying to

1092
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:38,069
open it so that it reaches all of

1093
00:44:38,069 --> 00:44:40,349
you through the region as it is virtual

1094
00:44:40,349 --> 00:44:43,469
obviously we know that that puts us in a

1095
00:44:43,469 --> 00:44:44,699
much more open geography

1096
00:44:44,699 --> 00:44:46,589
we will return to the face-to-face and we will return to

1097
00:44:46,589 --> 00:44:48,029
move regions so that those

1098
00:44:48,029 --> 00:44:49,529
who wait for us to be able to  transfer

1099
00:44:49,529 --> 00:44:50,609
precisely these people so that they

1100
00:44:50,609 --> 00:44:52,229
have the possibility of ne  tworking

1101
00:44:52,229 --> 00:44:53,849
live but for now our work

1102
00:44:53,849 --> 00:44:55,680
is mainly focused on

1103
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,079
trying to transform the region to the center

1104
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:00,920
that is coming soon

1105
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,160
at the end of September

1106
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,180
hybrid at least and we are going to see how

1107
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,530
it goes with the teak that the dream is to have

1108
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:08,570
all the guests here and  to be able to

1109
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:10,400
participate as we did before, perhaps

1110
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,680
with a few small forms but with the

1111
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,930
possibility of sharing and

1112
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:16,640
meeting again that is so necessary

1113
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,990
suddenly, perhaps it is not perhaps but that

1114
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:20,210
perhaps the fist bump or the greeting

1115
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:22,160
we need to see each other in the face.

1116
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,830
to return after a small round

1117
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:26,420
where we thank our beloved

1118
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:29,030
sponsors, our sponsors,

1119
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:30,680
Cristian roja comes to us, we are going to talk

1120
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,120
about three app security problems

1121
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,040
and three solutions to solve it all, come

1122
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,290
back immediately, remember that you

1123
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:38,290
can participate through it.  record chat

1124
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:41,120
looking for the 8.8 community you

1125
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,570
can enter you can do it through

1126
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:46,670
828 on twitter instagram you can us  s

1127
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:49,010
follow through youtube obviously

1128
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:50,360
remember that these lectures

1129
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,610
are recorded and separated from

1130
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:53,690
our youtube channel so that the web can

1131
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:55,250
share, review and expand

1132
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:57,290
their knowledge precisely if they

1133
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:59,540
cannot see the synchronous way at this

1134
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:01,640
moment while we transmit everything  that

1135
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,770
and more happens from here until three

1136
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:05,810
thirty four we have a day full of

1137
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:07,099
content

1138
00:46:07,099 --> 00:46:09,470
dimitri get ready, everything is coming

1139
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:11,029
but for now we are going to take a

1140
00:46:11,029 --> 00:46:12,019
little break before arriving with

1141
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,519
christian roja and we return immediately

1142
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:16,729
here at computer security conference 8.8

1143
00:46:16,729 --> 00:46:19,450
region  north

1144
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:24,059
i

1145
00:46:24,059 --> 00:46:26,689
yeah

1146
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,580
yeah
