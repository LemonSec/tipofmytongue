[Music]

4
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,950
and we are back again to

5
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,690
join us in what remains of the

6
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,600
afternoon of the 8.8 region to the north agenda

7
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,700


8
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,379
that has been part of the processes that

9
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,239
we have had with 8.8 to be with you

10
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,850
during all these  months about

11
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,699
11 or 12 events so far this year and

12
00:00:47,699 --> 00:00:49,620
we have really been very happy

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,660
for the reception, we also appreciate the

14
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,970
support of the sponsors and some of

15
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,620
those events have already begun to be

16
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,000
face-to-face, we are working hard

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,610
so that the regional center happens in a

18
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,890
way  mixed in a hybrid way and in

19
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,540
tecka which is the plant obviously

20
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,850
we also want to buy wood but

21
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,649
we had the possibility to carry out the

22
00:01:07,649 --> 00:01:10,229
first one in Las Vegas' and it was during the

23
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:12,960
stop which is 8.8 Las Vegas originally

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,970
last year we had made

25
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,780
virtually but before that it already

26
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,110
existed  in the flamingo suite and it took

27
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,119
place and it happened and we had several

28
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,700
conferences that originally the grace

29
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,860
of 8.8 hits it in raising the

30
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,830
Latin talks  ace of eight points of dzeko and

31
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,750
put them at the service of the

32
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,880
Latino community precisely on a good night of

33
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,810
disparity

34
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,149
and during this presentation we had the

35
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:38,829
opportunity to talk with the chip

36
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:41,049
designer officer of electronic cat who

37
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:44,110
is now a friend of 8.8 I am talking

38
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:48,130
about don  Eduardo contreras who is from

39
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,009
Mexico the man behind the casting see

40
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:53,830
how you are eduardo mounted very well his

41
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,049
friend you how are you well how

42
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:59,460
was the rear handle well

43
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,159
all good resting a little but everything

44
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,000
very well already perfect hey this new electronic tool caused a lot of

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,740
charm

46
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,270
that you had presented

47
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,400
during scop and we want to take advantage of

48
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,930
presenting it also to the users of

49
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,760
the national audience, we have

50
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,260
the possibility of avoiding some that

51
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,080
is through our 828 networks so

52
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,000
that they can connect and participate but before

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,680
for all of them then to see  What

54
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,319
is it about? I'm going to leave you here the

55
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,330
stage plate precisely from 8.8 region to

56
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,040
North for you to express yourself

57
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,350
and comment on us and enlighten us with this

58
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,670
tremendous tool designed by

59
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,130
you, thank you very much too and thank you very

60
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,650
much for the opportunity to

61
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,170
be here also

62
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,970
to thank you again for the opportunity

63
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,630
that we had a pleasure to meet you

64
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,620
physically, it feels quite good to

65
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,720
meet people from  again after the

66
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,430
pandemic so if

67
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,530
the stage is yours dear bard

68
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,930
please enlighten us a

69
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,550
lot thank you we are starting the

70
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,130
connecticut state

71
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,780
basically we are starting with who

72
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,170
we are i am part of this

73
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,760
company called electronics i am a

74
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,700
co-founder we started myself and three other

75
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,160
people and most engineers  of

76
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,280
people with mastery and since we started

77
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,050
this dream of making hardware in Mexico,

78
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,360
basically we are a Mexican company

79
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,630
I decided to dedicate to the design and development

80
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,489
of hardware manufacturing and embedded systems,

81
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:29,620
generally we design our

82
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,989
own systems that are opensource that

83
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:34,700
we like to share by the community

84
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,879
and that we want  Those that work so that

85
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,830
more people can be learning

86
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:43,250
about hardware then we also like very much to

87
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,959
be doing work for

88
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,319
specific companies where

89
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:49,190
we offer personalized solutions

90
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,370
from computer security sections

91
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,290
such as the topic of cats

92
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,930
nefer to toys such as for example

93
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,580
we have a card called  send a

94
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,849
diary

95
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,780
that we want practically we want to

96
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,090
generate a community of education and

97
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,610
open hardware of free hardware that

98
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,140
where anyone can participate

99
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,030
anyone can learn and

100
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,799
a business can also be generated based on

101
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:16,048
this we really like all this

102
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:18,329
philosophy and we believe that the

103
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,279
open community  source in the software is quite

104
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,899
strong and we want

105
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,330
this to be something possible in the hardware too,

106
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,560


107
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,220
all electronics work with

108
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,080
free software with which we work with kick-ass

109
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,639
to make all the

110
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,460
design tools of the arduino pcbs plan to

111
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,620
make the  compilation to a d environment  e

112
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,539
simple development so that

113
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:41,130
people who are not used to

114
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,410
using hardware can enter this

115
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,840


116
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,360
arduino world for example when you start to

117
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,150
compile by programs for rm because they are

118
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,100
based a lot on compilation chain

119
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,910
like psc since there must be

120
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,740
different kernels for rm but  We

121
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,919
generally use gsc, work based on gsc, and

122
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:03,440
we also use quite a lot of python, from

123
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,560
the strong language part of

124
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,930
computers to micro python of the

125
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,889
circuit python, which are practically

126
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:13,810
implementations of this language

127
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,480
applied to microcontrollers.

128
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,000


129
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,360
the union of two

130
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,760
entities of paula that is the brand of

131
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,530
our dear friend paulino calderón

132
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,820
that if you are seeing this I send you an

133
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,630
affectionate greeting and electronic jcce

134
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:39,260
paulino that the brother is a has

135
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,970
a company from

136
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,800
computer security called web I know that he

137
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,100
has also  written several books is someone

138
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:50,600
known in the world and he recently released

139
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,210
publi  I recently wrote a book together with more

140
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,280
people around the world on the

141
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,980
practice of La Jordi, since then she has a

142
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,990
lot of experience in the part of how

143
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:03,250
to reverse engineer how to do

144
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,330
audits towards the

145
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,950
Internet of Things systems and together with

146
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,160
electronic ones, we generate a

147
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,290
hardware  that it was functional for

148
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,360
everything that is needed today to generate

149
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,449
these audits

150
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:18,550
in this case we are talking about the

151
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,009
catheter this tool

152
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:24,279
is practically multiprotocol we have

153
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,990
the possibility of listening to

154
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,990
any type of transmission that is

155
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,360
within the range of Haitian technologies

156
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,729
that today  Today they are used as would be

157
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:35,189
wifi and

158
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:37,349
bluetooth, now

159
00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:40,930
others that go for example wimax or others

160
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,360
that go in their bladder where we

161
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,870
can be reading the packets and

162
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,800
capturing them to be able to do an

163
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,080
analysis and also since these are all

164
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,110
the chips that have internal

165
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,069
transceivers as well  we can do

166
00:06:54,069 --> 00:06:56,229
package injection so it becomes

167
00:06:56,229 --> 00:06:57,729
a tool  It is quite interesting

168
00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:00,849
where you can have a flexibility not

169
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:04,479
only to be receiving data but

170
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,520
also they are injecting it is very

171
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,339
important that is to say that it is not based

172
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:10,719
on that finger and it is not software defined

173
00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:14,469
radio this card works

174
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:16,749
based on hardware all modulation

175
00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:18,670
all the  modulation

176
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:21,520
on the same chip there is no pre post

177
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,050
processing that we have to do the

178
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,490
signals this gives us

179
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,860
quite good versatility because the data as it

180
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,100
arrives goes to our usb interface

181
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,830
the card has 2 with two

182
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,230
cores a cortex m 0 plus that

183
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,790
practically it is the chip that you can see

184
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,860
to the left

185
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,770
this is a sam of 21 and on the other hand we have

186
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:45,880
a cortex m 4 this is given by the

187
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,300
texas instruments chip s 15 32 15

188
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,080
when we are going to see it later this

189
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,000
card also allows you  accessing the

190
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,180
s & w pins of segi tar to make spark plug

191
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,550
has advanced more advanced programming of

192
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:03,010
the microcontrollers and on the other hand it

193
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,930
also has a usb connector that qu  e

194
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:07,000
is already a standard in the industry and then

195
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,280
practically anyone who has a

196
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,960
current cell phone will be able to

197
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,420
connect it directly to their cell phone to their

198
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,090
computer etc.

199
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,639
that the butcher offers us practically

200
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,290
they offer us as I mentioned before being

201
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:24,220
able to read fritz and bluetooth 5 and triple

202
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:30,090
800  2.15 the opal that is a part of the

203
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:34,120
connection of a good local connection girl

204
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,479
to share data on gaby and others

205
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:38,919
part of other proprietary systems

206
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,650
is really quite flexible all

207
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:43,900
these protocols are packed in

208
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,970
the texas instrument chip right now

209
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,440
we are going to see a block diagram how it

210
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,170
works  The card and well it is also

211
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,710
capable of

212
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,110
emulating or receiving packets the time and it

213
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,170
saves it then as we are doing it

214
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,060
because practically this is the block diagram,

215
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,610
we first have the usb which

216
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,260
is where the entire card is being fed,

217
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,750
this usb is connected to the

218
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,520
USB interface directly on the Sant

219
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,100
21 and the Thunder 21 practically serves

220
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,350
as the Orq  On

221
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,590
the other hand we have the csd 1352 which is

222
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,940
the largest microcontroller we

223
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,650
have but it does not have a usb

224
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,410
interface, so we already show the guard that it

225
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:26,000
has together with the sunp usb of 21,

226
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,230
the cs 1352 has the part of  go up and 2.4

227
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,670
and hertz that go directly to a

228
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,370
rf switch the rf switch is controlled

229
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,890
directly from the sant of 21 and also the

230
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,470
sun of 21 has an s & p connection and to

231
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,050
the specific chip of the aragua as you

232
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,570
can see all the now as you can see

233
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,700
All this is done by hardware,

234
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,470
there is really not something that is

235
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,930
processing

236
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,940
with sampling time etc.

237
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,400


238
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,200


239
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,470


240
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:03,650


241
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,350
our friend mike with

242
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,590
the fans but these devices

243
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:11,060
work in a different way so it

244
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,960
is very important here to understand that this

245
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,120
this device the way it works

246
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,310
is the moment these don't have you either

247
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,870
We must be worrying that the sampling

248
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,140
tank that the conversion rate that everything

249
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,420
is already embedded then gives us a lot of

250
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,770
versatility from the moment of

251
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:30,160
programming

252
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,100
that sniffer is not offered yet, since

253
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,990
entering the code practically

254
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,449
offers us a support of the wine this

255
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:40,730
we in electronics it  We work and

256
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,470
we really like the platform since it

257
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:45,620
is quite friendly and easy to start,

258
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,839
we also have support for code com,

259
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,870
so if you want

260
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:53,180
to program the microcontroller

261
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,339
ss 15

262
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:00,420
15 52 13 52, then you will be able to make it more

263
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,059
advanced, we also have a connector

264
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:05,189
sm / ea which is standard then in this

265
00:11:05,189 --> 00:11:06,389
way you can connect any

266
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:08,129
antenna that is 50 grams of

267
00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:09,629
impedance that has the

268
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:11,550
frequency spectrum that we are handling of

269
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,230
which spectra because we go from

270
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:16,410
900 megahertz to 2,400 with

271
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,230
bluetooth and wi  -fi

272
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,480
something very interesting and very important is

273
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,550
that the cct 1352 the main

274
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,140
chip hit all the

275
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,860
radio management  frequency and includes in the rom in

276
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,360
the ruin my memory

277
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,700
a bootloader that works on fair

278
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,920
so this chip is totally

279
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,470
reprogrammed speak villasante 21 the sant

280
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:40,550
of 21 acts as a translator from usb

281
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,430
to serial and simply sends the bits

282
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:48,490
to reprogram your pc 352

283
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,560
this  They allow us to upload

284
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,890
binaries ready with attacks or with

285
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,360
certain functions

286
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,360
and that the user only presses a button

287
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,200
and the firmware is sent back to your

288
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,060
different cats that is quite easy

289
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,620
to update even if it is the

290
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,440
large microcontroller

291
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,150
the card has four

292
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:13,300
indicator LEDs  It has a usb stick format and

293
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,910
well the one of 21 has a hoax to see that

294
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,590
called efe 2 which is already is also

295
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,970
being made a standard that is also

296
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,830
open source and all I am talking about

297
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:23,530
here is open hardware anyone can

298
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,630
enter to see the  kick and

299
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,980
rush docs with design

300
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,010
docs dot docs docs

301
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,630
all here is open source and

302
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:34,240
all can  n check you can learn from

303
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,820
here or also make improvements,

304
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,010
any feedback

305
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:42,640
that the community can give us is always appreciated

306
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,590
all this is the hardware

307
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:47,200
part, the iron part but in the end a

308
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,540
sniffer or a hardware tool

309
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,340
would be nothing without a  software that

310
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,370
supports it and gives the end user the

311
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:57,960
data they require, then

312
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,110
there are different software that already

313
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,170
have support for our call center

314
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:07,650
in this case this is a

315
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:10,350
texas instrument software that they take it away from you,

316
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,360
let's say for free, you just have to

317
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,160
fill out one  Formula in a way that

318
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,500
you say that it is not going to be a military man

319
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,250
this is quite interesting because you

320
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,010
open some people a software mentioned that

321
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,840
detects the device they detect you in

322
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,700
which serial port it is and you

323
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,650
configure it by means of clicks on what

324
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,090
frequency you want it to be  you are

325
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:34,450
listening in which channel in which type of

326
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,420
modulation and in what type of speed you

327
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,810
want it to be working because

328
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,460
within the different modulation  There are going to

329
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,810
be different transmission speeds

330
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,429


331
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:48,019
practically with this software, he

332
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:49,609
mentioned you can be sniffing

333
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:53,259
for 2.4 years and also from any league

334
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:56,209
say but time, any

335
00:13:56,209 --> 00:13:59,209
plea protocol you have exists, well

336
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:01,609
this one works as a

337
00:14:01,609 --> 00:14:04,369
walter plugin then at  moment of your being

338
00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:06,139
executing it you begin to see all the

339
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:07,459
packages that are receiving by

340
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:10,429
bluetooth by sylvie by any other

341
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:12,769
type of modulation directly in wards

342
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,840
erc without doing more

343
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,610
and this is because this is quite

344
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,740
interesting later I am going to show

345
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,570
a video of how it looked  working this

346
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,700
on the other hand we have the time and one will do it, it

347
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,890
is very important here to understand

348
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:27,290
that practically if you want to do

349
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:30,920
something with time because you pay a

350
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,920
decent patent to make your own chip or

351
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,260
implement the algorithm to

352
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,590
implement it in sdr or not  you can

353
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,840
then here in this case we

354
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,720
choose to buy the 770 which is the sx

355
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,900
262 this chip is a  evolution is not the

356
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,940
first chip taken out of now, this

357
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,850
evolution already has a

358
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,130
state machine that generates a

359
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:58,010


360
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:01,100
much healthier drawing environment or sniffing environment much

361
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,650
easier to handle because here you will be

362
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,630
able to send command and you  it will respond

363
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,370
and you do not have to handle everything by

364
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,720
registers

365
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,569
well personally I really like

366
00:15:12,569 --> 00:15:14,310
working with registers I am very

367
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,019
used to that but there are many

368
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:18,180
people who are not so familiar with the

369
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,829
hardware so they already have a state machine it

370
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:21,949
is like having  An idea and

371
00:15:21,949 --> 00:15:24,480
then only the query you know what

372
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,970
happened and you expect you to do by site is

373
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:29,279
a very interesting thing and that since

374
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,459


375
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:33,689
the support is practically already working, right now we are making it

376
00:15:33,689 --> 00:15:36,000
travel, wine, use the libraries and others,

377
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,649
we are handling everything because it was ruined

378
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:39,540
but also  it can be handled for

379
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,300
example with the study with directly

380
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,189
with some program of make etc.

381
00:15:44,189 --> 00:15:45,660
for the part of the programming of the

382
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,879
microco  ntroller and well we already

383
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:49,620
have examples in burning where

384
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,540
you have a law that by what command

385
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,189
cereals you can be seeing that it

386
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:55,860
arrives by would be the in lora and lora

387
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,230
wow it is worth mentioning that well the whole

388
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,060
part of now is compatible with

389
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,560
hour one because  Now one is only an

390
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,810
implementation of a network layer

391
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:06,029
so in the end all the packets that

392
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:08,129
are will make one packets are in

393
00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:10,500
lora modulation and as you may be

394
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,080
receiving

395
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,180
them there is also another application that is already

396
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:18,520
fully functional, follow on YouTube,

397
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,020
this is true.  xxxv imbert this is a

398
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,330
combination of

399
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,470
software where we have a

400
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:27,740
special firmware to get all the part of

401
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,440
zigbee is 7 is thaksin where is it

402
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,800
with it and in this part this runs in it

403
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,260
can run in windows without need I

404
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,430
am wrong it can also put without

405
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,730
problems marked those linux and allows you to

406
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:41,770
use

407
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:45,230
good because it allows you to read the

408
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:49,340
devices although in the gateway the

409
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,100
zigbee concentrator and also of es  This

410
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,110
way you can with the butcher to make

411
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,480
a class of kate way where you will be able to

412
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,310
be putting the data into mx

413
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,850
this allows you to integrate

414
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,720
devices very easily or also make

415
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,859
audits of them in a simple way since

416
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:10,480
you can act as the gateway does not

417
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,770
then there at the end a gateway that

418
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:17,170
generates what is it you have a device

419
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,900
that is receiving all the data and it is

420
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,060
a node device that will be

421
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,699
sent if you create another gateway it may

422
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:26,800
be receiving the 22 gateways if there is

423
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,660
no major problem then it is not

424
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,730
even  As a man, look at the end, this

425
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,860
is how we hear that it will also

426
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,330
act as a gateway to the

427
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:35,380
information that she is sending,

428
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:38,410
so it becomes quite interesting

429
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,850
all the possibilities you have here

430
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,500
and this device is not all this

431
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,880
site on YouTube and now  we tested it with

432
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,550
xiaomi which is practically the photo that

433
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,580
was here

434
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,830
these are yao me home devices if

435
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,809
I'm not mistaken and all working so

436
00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:56,850
If I already had access to the

437
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,299
information that steve was going to, it is

438
00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:04,110
practically a software for

439
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:07,260
auditing or sniffering or it is not going to

440
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,080
be

441
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,630
a data search within the

442
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:14,840
bluetooth 5 standard, in this case

443
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,010
we are already  doing the part of

444
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:20,150
we are working together to

445
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,980
make it

446
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,870
completely compatible right now it is

447
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,550
still a section and mentally we continue

448
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,280
working on making it compatible here

449
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,260
because we have to thank the sultan almost in

450
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,870
cannes who is who practically has

451
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:36,110
been is the one who is moving this east

452
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,270
of  this software or that it is maintaining

453
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:41,120
in some way and since we are

454
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,310
in the original repository we are

455
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,660
working to make it compatible,

456
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,300
it

457
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,600
would still come, this is still

458
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,340
experimental so here we may be

459
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,100
receiving other types of signals that are

460
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,010
your trip for example with which we have

461
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,110
data  that it is quite common to see in the

462
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:01,120
US or in some houses that have

463
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,810
temperature control then  ces with or

464
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,580
pentrita because there is also enough

465
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,930
documentation as the open project

466
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,240
that it is but we are trying to

467
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,070
integrate our tool

468
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:15,340
into this arduino project because it is

469
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,170
practically already fully

470
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:20,650
supported that cost us some work

471
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,690
we already have enough time working

472
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:25,390
with this but  Well, practically I had

473
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,280
here you can select the caps or fer

474
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,260
if you want the usb to be active if you

475
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,580
do not want extractives if you want it to

476
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,710
work as a hd and it becomes quite

477
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,690
interesting for example imagine doing

478
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,850
a roberto here with this part of

479
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:39,310
eye to another type of  of interesting

480
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:43,379
things that generate milk and others

481
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,130
now so this is more like the

482
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,780
part of those who are more attached to the

483
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,280
hardware or those who are

484
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,380
curious about the hardware but it

485
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,070
is also a very interesting part

486
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:56,140
practically with this garden we

487
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,310
We support the main microcontroller,

488
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:00,160
which is the sant of 21, and as it

489
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,380
has the complete support  Everything works

490
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,990
and there are libraries and examples already made

491
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:08,490
in the repositories.

492
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,220
All this is an explanation of what

493
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:15,580
we can do with cats ni fer

494
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,250
today and also what we are

495
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,750
working on is not everything we have in mind

496
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,390
when  In the end, this is a tool that

497
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,860
can grow a lot due to the

498
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,930
flexibility it has and since this is the

499
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,610
roadmap we have, we are

500
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,290
practically working on adding support

501
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,520


502
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,010
for more robust computer security audit software, something more

503
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:35,260
professional, and since this standard already existed,

504
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,480
we do not want  reinvent the wheel

505
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,310
we want to be compatible with what already

506
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,910
exists

507
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,740
here, something quite interesting is that it is

508
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,540
the part of the x lite wireless project.

509
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,670


510
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:52,420


511
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,700


512
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,190


513
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,870
This is quite

514
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,760
interesting and well this was also

515
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,060
thanks to the time when there are already other

516
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,560
repositories that we have  found on

517
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,940
github and they ended up being sent

518
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,820
where there are already other stress keys there

519
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,340
are also other fingers for the

520
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:15,559
sham of 21 other timbers for the cc 3

521
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:18,169
so it is quite interesting how

522
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:20,210
this project is growing in such a short

523
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,360
time

524
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,330
because as I mentioned in the  The

525
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,890
strongest roadmap is to add support

526
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,380
for Enrique Audit software to

527
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,630
add and update

528
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,980
wardak directors because for example right now the

529
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,300
guard director who is working

530
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,950
on windows but who has removed but we want

531
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,240
the framework to be compatible

532
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,050
also in linux

533
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,630
generate firmware  with attacks and

534
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:45,000
common pre-programmed tasks, for example

535
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,710
replay attacks for different

536
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:49,050
protocols, fusters bit clippers, and they

537
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:52,650
even mentioned a hummer,

538
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:55,050
but a bit illegal, Mexico, so it

539
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:58,290
is so interesting in the end, they are only

540
00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:59,820
tools, each one uses them

541
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,930
as they need and also  we still have to

542
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,340
work and we will be

543
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,810
working on adding examples for

544
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,820
everyone  the projects cut and well if

545
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,380
I am commenting on what already works and is

546
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,140
tested here is a small demo video

547
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:16,340
of how he works,

548
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:19,440
the butcher is practically here you can

549
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,679
see that because the software would be running, he

550
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,640
leaves you this instrument

551
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,240
we are here they are we explain to him in

552
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,520
detective  and there it will detect in which

553
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,820
serial port our device is

554
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,169
after it detected the device,

555
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:37,140
we can configure it and here

556
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,650
we can select a series of

557
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,780
protocols that are ready to be

558
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,780
started, for example, triple law

559
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,690
802.15.4 that could practically be

560
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:50,659
psychiatry

561
00:22:50,659 --> 00:22:52,549
if  you want it to be long range

562
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:55,070
low range the speed you want from

563
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,629
the kilobits I mentioned at what

564
00:22:56,629 --> 00:23:01,580
frequency 900 15 868 433 if you want

565
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,590
something generic that is only modulated to

566
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,440
dry gf which is practically a

567
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,929
fairly common type of evolution or if you want to

568
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,779
double a megabit and so on at the end

569
00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:14,599
because you decide there with a little button you

570
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:18,970
give it and the video will return to

571
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,409
me  select the technology you are going to use you

572
00:23:23,409 --> 00:23:25,609
select which channel you are going to be

573
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:27,320
working on it is important to say that the

574
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,840
butcher works on channels no

575
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,299
it is not a cdr it does not capture the entire spectrum it

576
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:34,100
is very important to take this into account

577
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,919
then yes it can be select as

578
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:38,600
many channels  But it will be a

579
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,519
hopping, it will be reading one and then

580
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,169
another and then another and then another, it is very

581
00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:44,419
important to have this good

582
00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:45,889
once this is running because we are going to

583
00:23:45,889 --> 00:23:48,769
see that the incoming packages come here

584
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:52,700
and we are going to open  him

585
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,879
the wasser software with certain

586
00:23:54,879 --> 00:23:58,669
arguments to open the device

587
00:23:58,669 --> 00:24:00,289
so that it opens, let's say configured

588
00:24:00,289 --> 00:24:02,659
and you are going to start seeing all the

589
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:06,559
bluetooth data here is our

590
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,999
Pauline colleague because he is practically

591
00:24:07,999 --> 00:24:10,279


592
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:14,330
trying to read the data that is

593
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:17,090
between a one  touch is a dynamic frame, it

594
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:20,320
is a glucometer and well, here it is

595
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,570
following all the data and it

596
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,789


597
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:27,309
is

598
00:24:27,309 --> 00:24:28,999
practically held here, we are already doing  Do

599
00:24:28,999 --> 00:24:30,830
a sniffing you can also do by

600
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:34,059
hardware a part

601
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,970
of limitation of which markers you want to

602
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:39,250
see and which ones is not quite

603
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,929
interesting in the end all this works

604
00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:44,970
in a let's say

605
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:47,190
basic way by serial command so it is

606
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:49,610
quite simple

607
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:50,980
and itcan be

608
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,840
modified in

609
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,630
the electronic hip hop repository

610
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,290
Scouts or see

611
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:59,360
anyone who is interested I invite

612
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,140
you to go read the wiki put your remember

613
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:06,200
if you have a problem or something or if there

614
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,360
you will find the thematic pcbs

615
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,490
examples wiki documentation and also the

616
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:12,890
license that we are working with

617
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:16,250
this device and then practically

618
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,920
That would be all I can tell you

619
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,640
about the portfolio and this I wanted to

620
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,710
leave you with this photo and just yesterday we had the

621
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:27,770
sican mandolin, a darth vader and printed

622
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:28,750
in 3d

623
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:32,150
and so do not doubt what you can

624
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:34,640
do on the dark side with this

625
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,790
tool

626
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:44,080
I every time he is present about

627
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,970
the story giving twice that

628
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:48,610
I keep these and I every day I am more surprised he

629
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:52,299
looks ta  n simple it looks so simple but

630
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:53,799
it is not and it is wonderful all the

631
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:55,990
utilities that it has we are going to enter

632
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:58,539
the questions section and we invite

633
00:25:58,539 --> 00:25:59,590
all those who are connected

634
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:02,440
through paz line or through our networks

635
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,990
to start formulating their  Doubts about

636
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,640
cats ni fer here with Eduardo we have

637
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,559
time we can talk and he wants

638
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:09,850
all the possibilities in the world so that

639
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:12,250
we can go so that we can participate I

640
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,950
have some doubts about the production

641
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,750
of this and a doubt that it generated

642
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,399
us here as a team and I want to

643
00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:20,289
take advantage  to ask when you when

644
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:23,260
when electronic cats decide to start

645
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,450
producing technology in Mexico

646
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,639
what is the volume of technology that

647
00:26:27,639 --> 00:26:29,740
begins to produce how much katz and fer

648
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,870
are taking an average as volume that

649
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:34,929
would interest me to know ok right now we are

650
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:36,519
taking

651
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:39,969
100 per circulation the idea would be to get more

652
00:26:39,969 --> 00:26:42,609
but also there right now the part where

653
00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:45,909
there are no chips the silicon short is

654
00:26:45,909 --> 00:26:47,519
making a pretty strong problem

655
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:50,519
so

656
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,350
practically  ically now we are for example

657
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,630
taking potholes of 100 from sneijder but

658
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:58,740
sometimes we take from 10 20 50 and there have been

659
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,990
times that we take out of 500 orders

660
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:05,520
so it is a variant it seems to me that you

661
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,010
hear click on helmand question can you

662
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:09,779
win and jackpot

663
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:14,129
can be scanned and  I will clarify

664
00:27:14,129 --> 00:27:16,519
that this

665
00:27:16,529 --> 00:27:18,489
is practically for that or that is

666
00:27:18,489 --> 00:27:19,899
anything that has to do with

667
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:22,590
additives to use these protocols

668
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:25,169
diego sale for the national or

669
00:27:25,169 --> 00:27:27,059
international market how they can access to

670
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:28,909
acquire the equipment

671
00:27:28,909 --> 00:27:32,479
ok until now we made the first match

672
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:33,919
just for depp when  We are already

673
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,710
producing the second in this case

674
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,539
we have on our website that I did not

675
00:27:38,539 --> 00:27:42,229
mention anything more pressed

676
00:27:42,229 --> 00:27:43,450
expression of

677
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:46,940
practically the axis the so that if everything

678
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,070
I do not know if I can project a little fast

679
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,759
on the screen

680
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:53,729
yes please go ahead present ok

681
00:27:53,729 --> 00:27:56,200
as you can see here

682
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,520
We practically have our

683
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,370
dotcom electronic page, two of them get together and

684
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:03,590
if they look for cats or fer they will find

685
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,659
that right now they are  Together they still

686
00:28:05,659 --> 00:28:08,440
reach the pre-sale is at 125 dollars

687
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,970
obviously more sent to depending on the

688
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:16,039
area and well in October we are planning to

689
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:19,029
be sending and if well

690
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:21,440
theoretically they could come out earlier this is

691
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,710
a spoiler but we do not promise anything due to

692
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,270
the shortage of chips is  making

693
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,950
the part of finding certain components a little difficult, we

694
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:29,960
already fixed it

695
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,730
but it will take a little longer then

696
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:34,789
by October 2021 we are already sending

697
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:38,669
this new match of cats ni first

698
00:28:38,669 --> 00:28:41,480
and if we do deliveries,

699
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,519
let's say worldwide we

700
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:47,399
have never really battled with that part  Hey

701
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:49,379
Eduardo, ask a colleague of yours here, that

702
00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:52,619
is, a namesake of yours who asks if in

703
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:53,970
a second run there will be

704
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:56,309
some kind of improvement that they are thinking of

705
00:28:56,309 --> 00:28:58,020
adding

706
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,930
as it was not an implement but

707
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:03,240
for the same change of chips, good for

708
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,040
the same apart  of the core touch chip

709
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,340
where no longer silicon we had to make

710
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,810
some adjustments in the microcontrollers

711
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:12,750
that they will be using and in order

712
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,370
to  The production continues to continue

713
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:18,660
because right now, rather than focusing on the

714
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,760
features, we are focusing on making it

715
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,530
fully functional with everything it

716
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:25,170
has and apart from the fact that it is manufacturing, speak

717
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:27,330
still because it is the problem of

718
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:31,490
silicon, if it is quite important,

719
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,150
perfect,

720
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,760
hey, they ask us what they are willing

721
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,260
to do.  concession what someone else

722
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,580
sells in between to be able to reach

723
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,070
all regions without problems, I do not

724
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,170
even know because they can send us an email

725
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:44,650
to

726
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:48,490
Héctor arroba electronically or it is stolen

727
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:52,180
electronically or directly in the clear

728
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:55,240
to see if the g6 can

729
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,840
also notice it for  that we continue later to be

730
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,470
as a store in English

731
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:04,900
electronics katz dotcom

732
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,030
to license because what is

733
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,140
asking each rightly if

734
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,690
someone can sell it here or if they

735
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:13,930
can, we do not give exclusivity because as

736
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,100
we have the online store that is

737
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,580
worldwide, the exclusivity in a country has

738
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,780
We have to meet as many requirements

739
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,900
for it to happen, but yes, we do.

740
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,050
rte that it can be sold by

741
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:28,150
distributors and wilson fernanda

742
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:30,910
asks they are in rss and just below

743
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:33,550
someone else asks once installed or

744
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:37,350
connected has the assistance system

745
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,570
does not have the assistance system

746
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:41,840
we have the wiki and it is as the most

747
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,580
commented that we have been able to  to do so

748
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,429
that you go step by step but an

749
00:30:46,429 --> 00:30:49,830
automatic system of let's say step by step we do not

750
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:52,260
have it done and it is not currently in

751
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,720
the roadmap wilson question are you in the

752
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,700
rc are you as electronic cat sip

753
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:02,060
in social networks and more

754
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,660
if you can give them please  They have on

755
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:08,090
facebook on instagram twitter we are

756
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:11,000
like electronic cats

757
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,310
if you are looking for electronic data in English

758
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:15,860
because it will appear on twitter the handler is

759
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:18,200
electronic cats but with only one we

760
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,290
won the one who had I know it

761
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:22,840
perfect today is Diego it seems that

762
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,340
Mexico asks you the  Physical place where he

763
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,930
swiped here in Mexico or it is only by

764
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:29,800
digital order in Mexico it would only be in

765
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:33,850
Aguascalientes and you can go through it

766
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,309
Mexico we also have shipping  Ios and tops are

767
00:31:36,309 --> 00:31:38,200
obviously cheaper than

768
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,210
international ones

769
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:41,950
and pelado blanch asks how

770
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:43,890
far the legality of these devices goes.

771
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:45,520
I think that depends on the

772
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,010
jurisprudence, gentleman, not more

773
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:50,140
than on the jurisprudence

774
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,539
regarding the legality of radio frequency is

775
00:31:52,539 --> 00:31:54,070
totally legal.  Because all these

776
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:57,309
bands are and sm are made to be

777
00:31:57,309 --> 00:31:59,230
used for industrial services and medical

778
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:02,020
uses for anyone, not in the end, that's why

779
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,010
anyone can have these

780
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:06,220
devices at home the legality in

781
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:09,220
the device is the legality in

782
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:12,100
what they use it for, for example  steal or

783
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,830
something like that you call

784
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:18,340
more let's say attack is where they change

785
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,309
so it is also like everyone uses

786
00:32:21,309 --> 00:32:25,299
a knife as they want in the end is

787
00:32:25,299 --> 00:32:26,440
thinking the same example I am not going to

788
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,450
enter the simple to be able to cook the

789
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,970
same thing so as not to end up doing

790
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:33,250
something that is not  It should be clear but in the

791
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,260
end the knife is totally legal the

792
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,539
same with this card then of course what

793
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:38,320
is there  Tender is that a

794
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,130
tool the user value is clear

795
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:44,190
and the tool is even like it

796
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,610
is not in a case maybe right now and others

797
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:49,020
we are trying to do it more as

798
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,910
for the cobista who likes

799
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,620
electronics and who also has in the

800
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,540
part  For example, Greece with gadgets

801
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,610
also has this part where they are

802
00:32:56,610 --> 00:33:00,090
hairless devices but they work in

803
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:01,580
the end, the

804
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,200
worst thing is because they don't have a housing, it says yes of

805
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,890
course, of course they don't have you know how

806
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:11,010
this case and others or that is clearly that

807
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:12,330
helps a lot to the value too

808
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:15,510
purchase of the product because it is said

809
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:18,150
as a virtual plastic package also

810
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,620
makes this type of technology a bit more expensive,

811
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,560
we just wanted to have it as close to

812
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,930
the price that we think

813
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:27,890
is the right one for the

814
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:30,480
quality of the product that it is and the

815
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,640
versatility it has and put it  a

816
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,130
better packaging we are getting

817
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:38,010
a series of crises and so on and it will become

818
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:39,300
quite expensive as mentions

819
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,520
so if we try to stay in

820
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,500
On his floor

821
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,660
today a character from Chile

822
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,820
called m pozas says in Chilean they wait for

823
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,220
the reception of rf is an excellent

824
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,660
tool the one they are presenting

825
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,910
sends you a

826
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,930
comment there about the companies that he is

827
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:57,100
generating and that as you can see the

828
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,000
comments almost  all are from

829
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,580
acquisition or how to get to them in

830
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,070
the background is a common reception

831
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,270
I imagine we were

832
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,590
quite surprised so today you are here

833
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:09,179
with people of 88 hey it is about the same

834
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:12,989
thinking a little about the cost of

835
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:15,969
production of this equipment  You have

836
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:19,210
some kind of agreement or you work with

837
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:21,310
some kind of community to have

838
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,770
tested the equipment before

839
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,418
launching it, you worked with someone outside

840
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:28,480
the industry to test to raise the

841
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,909
league of cats electronics cats as is

842
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:33,639
not with Paulino Calderón's team

843
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:36,760
now  Yes, he is the

844
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,949
security guru for us in this

845
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:41,440
part so he is practically like the

846
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,290
external agent that is to the sim card

847
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,840
without having so much experience.

848
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,790
Experience using hardware, that is, has experience but it

849
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:51,550
is in the software area, it seems to me

850
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,589
then it is also a different point of view

851
00:34:53,589 --> 00:34:55,329
that, for example, I see a mike

852
00:34:55,329 --> 00:34:58,329
and it makes me like daily bread, not

853
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:01,119
50 of the program, well, to the program and so on.

854
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,760
You know how the chip changes and you already know

855
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,369
how a different point of view is

856
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:07,990
that it is also a pretty good synergy to

857
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:09,250


858
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,140
have

859
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,190
mister I like it because my question

860
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:14,349
could be modulated some stl to print

861
00:35:14,349 --> 00:35:17,339
in 3d if we even already have

862
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:21,070
just the people of x-  men already made one he made his

863
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:23,440
own and we already uploaded it directly

864
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,540
in the hip hop challenge now they can

865
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,829
print it and we are also

866
00:35:26,829 --> 00:35:29,890
generating one where the keys will also

867
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,390
have access to the buttons just today

868
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:34,089
we were printing another another another that

869
00:35:34,089 --> 00:35:36,369
says he quoted from  for tests to publish

870
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:40,359
the final version but yes and stl and stps

871
00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:42,400
as they are opensource so they can

872
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,020
also be modified if that is super

873
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,160
interesting I love that you have left

874
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,599
the signature and open to everything  as open

875
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:48,070
source that was a topic that was very good

876
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,420
result, usually large sheets

877
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:52,420
with during the talk yes quite a lot and they

878
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,130
like to collaborate a lot

879
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:56,619
I liked simply the x-men that

880
00:35:56,619 --> 00:35:58,240
already put the batteries and that already have

881
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,460
different firmware is like  more people

882
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,890
are helping us to meet the goal

883
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:04,720
of having more versatility and

884
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,150
easier to use what a wonderful hey

885
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,970
ask, make it

886
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:10,720
essentially

887
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,709
clear if you can.

888
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,210
is a question for the production of

889
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:17,859
88 we are going to answer it later because a

890
00:36:17,859 --> 00:36:19,359
question for the production  of 88 that

891
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,400
has nothing to do with you later, but

892
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,720
about that region it is okay to say that

893
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,609
if we are raffling the cut

894
00:36:24,609 --> 00:36:30,240
safer and you can participate for it at 828

895
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,619
points through our website you can participate

896
00:36:32,619 --> 00:36:34,170
in our networks

897
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:36,099
we have to give away two

898
00:36:36,099 --> 00:36:38,320
tools so you can

899
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,530
share they can approach and not wait for

900
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:44,340
the shipment because they are already in Chile the

901
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:48,630
Catalan asks support for or sx it

902
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:52,090
seems that it is yes only what will it be  that

903
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:54,520
we are working on it there is even a

904
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,650
group between the great way 'we have a

905
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:59,470
group if you have doubts send a tweet

906
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:01,510
is where the people are already working

907
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,400
also on the part of making the

908
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,650
directors save in the web framework

909
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:07,570
well that it works for framework  of

910
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:09,910
cylinders because it is only for

911
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:12,640
windows right now but to be something that we do not like

912
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,310
very much so we are trying to go

913
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:18,370
to make it multiplatform today

914
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,870
someone asks that they have had a

915
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,400
problem with the test stage they had

916
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,740
a legal problem the word legal is

917
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,920
legal '  nothing reaches the end in

918
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,020
electronics we have more than five years

919
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:32,200
working with rf so we have

920
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,390
our special measurement equipment

921
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,610
and we have our

922
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:39,220
specific test places where we know that

923
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,200
we are not going beyond the

924
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,430
allowed limits so we

925
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:45,290
have never had any problem  legal

926
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:48,530
in that perfect aspect

927
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:51,950
eduardo i am going to fire you little by

928
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,630
little it would be super good if i said first

929
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,400
you were your networks if it is possible so

930
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,069
that people come closer to ask you

931
00:37:57,069 --> 00:38:00,020
to know if for doubts

932
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,339
anything that tiger with the casting and ferb

933
00:38:01,339 --> 00:38:02,990
especially for people who are

934
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,579
asking why many characters

935
00:38:04,579 --> 00:38:06,980
here in the chat who want to see the

936
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,900
possibility  to license that would be super

937
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,150
interesting also to try so if

938
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,500
you can give your networks it would be wonderful

939
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,020
again they find me as

940
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:17,839
at forever but I am going to put it

941
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:21,349
right here, cord your leather plate if

942
00:38:21,349 --> 00:38:25,180
normally everyone says good

943
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:34,760
and it is my whole life  What do they say to me like this

944
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,910
then it's already like I have very

945
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:39,500
normalized sometimes they say bard and

946

was going to say it has gone wrong analysts tell me a

948
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:45,920
zombie years ago the correspondence

949

right by participating through

968
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,310
the networks of 8.8

969
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:36,020
828 or triple w 828 points per participant

970
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,210
and you are this tremendous tool you already know

971
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,070
about  what it is capable of, you already know what it can

972
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,810
do and you can investigate even more

973
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,700
because, as the güero said, they are

974
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,880
in the stage of continuing to improve through

975
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,590
the information that comes from feedback from

976
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,270
the users themselves, this tool, which

977

8.8 and talking with Paulino to be able to

996
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,010
