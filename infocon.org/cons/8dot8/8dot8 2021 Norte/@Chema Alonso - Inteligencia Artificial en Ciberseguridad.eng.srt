121
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,460
of the professions where it is very difficult to

122
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,560
find a profession in technology or

123
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,480
in any other area that has had

124
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,820
these technological communities that have

125
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,360
helped so much  young people to learn and

126
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,190
that they have shared so much knowledge

127
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,680
so for 20 years that I have been

128
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,840
bringing the world of things to

129
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,660
me the work that is done with the

130
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,220
committees that organize these meetings

131
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,130
where we give conferences where there is

132
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,830
an open window  to new kids

133
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,440
who come to present their

134
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,040
research people who come to

135
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,820
discover and learn what this is that is

136
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,220
this that is happening in the  The world of

137
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,410
our professions is wonderful

138
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,030
so when

00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,820
and he raised the possibility of being

140
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,560
in 8.8 as a more active member and they

141
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,420
will help to

142
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,040
push to spread the knowledge and

143
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,740
make it more relevant because it

144
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,410
seemed to me a unique opportunity so I did

145
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,170
not get involved  the blanket at the head up to

146
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,380

with the other end 8 great is

148
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,210

149
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,430
general what we are in this world

150
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,650
things help us a lot you can see

151
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:28,020
things that are not seen in other places and

152
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,510
finally gives space  so that

153
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,460
hackers and researchers publish their

154
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,410
content and their project and as it talks about

155
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,240
your intermediate project, your projects are followed

156
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,030
quite a lot as much as on the

157
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,230
side of the bad

158
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,900
xerox worker that I dance I have

159
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,080
most of the books are very good

160
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,050
direct learning and in  Spanish and

161
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,430
now you are with another project as well

162
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,039

163
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:54,659

well, really, I think that all

169
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:09,330
hackers have a vocation to

170
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,819
build things to create technology

171
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:13,729
despite the fact that the media

172
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:17,009
many times see  a negative or

173
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:18,599
destructive facet in the work that

174
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:20,219
hackers do is not true hackers always

175
00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:22,979
look for how to improve the technology that

176
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:25,289
there is how to fix things in the case

177
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:27,810
of mype to the xbox is a problem that

178
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,840
we have today on the internet where if

179
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,219
you publish  your email address

180
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:33,870
quickly what comes to you

181
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,000
is lots of spam and phishing emails

182
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,879
from malware attacks and people who are not

183
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:41,190
interested in your time so

184
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:44,219
using an idea an old idea that

185
00:07:44,219 --> 00:07:46,110
is not that it is not ours in fact bill

186
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:49,710
gates spoke  In his book the road ahead, he

187
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,080
talked about the fact that e-mail

188
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,030
would die if we didn't protect it and if he

189
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:56,880
didn't change it, let's go and decide to

190
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,980
create my public inbox don  de is a way

191
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,480
of being exposed to the internet where

192
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,210
anyone in the world who wants to

193
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,370
talk to me can do it anyone in

194
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,420
the world who wants to talk to

195
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,710
you who wants to talk to kevin

196
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,270
mitnick or who wants to talk to gabriel

197
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,460
what I want to talk to all of

198
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,350
us in  this platform can do it

199
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:16,470
but for there to be a barrier

200
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,930
that makes spam for malware

201
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,760
for people who really have no

202
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,490
interest insurmountable because we have a

203
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,080
protection based on tempos in such a

204
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,300
way that you have to pay

205
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,970
for the times the price is five

206
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:33,070
dollars three dollars two dollars

207
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,870
you can even get free times

208
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,760
because there are sponsors to

209
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,679
get those times but that already means

210
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:41,919
that the number of messages that reach

211
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,570
the people who receive them on the

212
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,089
platform are qualified and that the

213
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:48,640
person responds to it and also many  of

214
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,940
these people are deciding

215
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,470
that those times that come to them be

216
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,930
donated to social projects  to NGOs

217
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,029
etc. in such a way that the time they

218
00:08:58,029 --> 00:08:59,339
are investing in

219
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,870
answering to a person who reads that they have

220
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,279
come through the internet and that they

221
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,320
do not know will positively revert to a

222
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,360
social project so we have been with

223
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,910
this project for two years

224
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,220
than in October  two years ago and the truth

225
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,769
is that the result is being

226
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:16,959
fantastic and they are allowing

227
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,790
us people like me who am on the internet

228
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,190
where when I published my

229
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,560
email I received 300 messages a

230
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,959
day and I am not exaggerating then to be able to

231
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:27,640
have a mailbox  email

232
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,529
with which I can communicate with very

233
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:31,240
relevant people very important in my life today

234
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,089


235
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:34,550
and it is not terrific in fact I already created

236
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,829
my account a couple of days ago I already have

237
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:39,259
my first days as you said your ipad

238
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:41,720
there are sponsors who can give you

239
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,749
some  times and if you can see for example

240
00:09:44,749 --> 00:09:47,660
a video in reviewing a content give

241
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,339
your opinion they will give you those

242
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,559
times and that all guests invite

243
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:53,959
so that they enter the platform,

244
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:56,350
there are very important people to register,

245
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:00,410
so it will be very

246
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,749
interesting and look at

247
00:10:02,749 --> 00:10:04,309
what we are going to talk about

248
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:07,220
today, which is about artificial intelligence

249
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,439
and cybersecurity.

250
00:10:09,439 --> 00:10:11,800
we have to lay a foundation and

251
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,230
differentiate if you cannot comment on

252
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,699
the difference between

253
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,420
artificial intelligence and machine learning

254
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,760
well in the end when we talk about

255
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,140
artificial intelligence we talk about

256
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,880
any computer system that

257
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,340
demonstrates intelligence similar

258
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,930
to human beings when solving

259
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,010
problems

260
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,620
we generally speak  of

261
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,330
artificial intelligence models that are capable

262
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:37,810
of making complex decisions based on

263
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,820
a problem that arises when

264
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,290
we speak of machine learning we speak of

265
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,880
algorithms that are capable of learning

266
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,670
where the ingenuity or the programmer of

267
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,250
those algorithms is not telling

268
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,930
artificial intelligence  what do you

269
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,760
have to learn if we are not

270
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,950
saying where it has to learn not

271
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:57,280
what we give it data so that

272
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,990
artificial intelligence through its

273
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,730
machine learning algorithms is

274
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,560
able to learn and this leads us to

275
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,620
very spectacular situations where if

276
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,680
we give it data that is wrong or if we

277
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,050
give it data  that have some bias of

278
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,680
race or finger or gender etc.

279
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,180
artificial intelligence can learn

280
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,060
things quite negative things and on the

281
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,010
other hand we have algorithms that are

282
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:24,370
capable of learning from

283
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,059
reality as well but doing so with such quality

284
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:30,139
that they are capable of recreating

285
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:32,339
reality.  Well enough to

286
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:34,019
fool human beings and that is the

287
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:36,290
case of the famous vig bay that

288
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,850
we only call the replicants where,

289
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,619
well, we could find that you

290
00:11:40,619 --> 00:11:41,730
would not be talking with chema alonso

291
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,350
but with an artificial intelligence model

292
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,839
that was representing

293
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,669
chema  alonso as you know him

294
00:11:47,669 --> 00:11:49,949
then let's say that artificial intelligence

295
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:52,410
has opened  For the world

296
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,149
of security researchers and for

297
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:55,980
the area of computer security,

298
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,379
endless possibilities that have

299
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:00,359
to transform the profession we have

300
00:12:00,359 --> 00:12:03,629
today, great since we are talking about

301
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:05,189
that, there are quite a few areas where

302
00:12:05,189 --> 00:12:07,290
we can occupy this

303
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,749
artificial intelligence,

304
00:12:08,749 --> 00:12:10,980
how much do you think?  that we are

305
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,350
using it today with in the field it

306
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,970
has been of

307
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,189
good security we are at the dawn and we are

308
00:12:17,189 --> 00:12:19,230
beginning to understand

309
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,449
cybersecurity and artificial intelligence

310
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,470
applied to

311
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,430
security city we will not find it in

312
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,290
different areas we are going to use it

313
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,389
as an assistant to

314
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:31,110
decision making in

315
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,339
security city management environments to

316
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:34,259
make our place on

317
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:36,930
center site much more efficient

318
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,639
and much more intelligent thanks to

319
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,930
artificial intelligence models

320
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,209
many of the tools that we

321
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:44,339
use  Nowadays, therefore, from

322
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:47,149
firewalls to probes to

323
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:50,579
analysis systems of t  I have human behavior that they

324
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:52,829
are watching us if an employee or a

325
00:12:52,829 --> 00:12:54,089
person who is a person who is

326
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:55,439
connected to our network is going to

327
00:12:55,439 --> 00:12:57,180
become valuable has some malicious ideas

328
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,610
because they are much more intelligent not

329
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,740
that it would be one of the first areas but

330
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,290
then we have the  part where

331
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,939
artificial intelligence helps

332
00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:08,009
attackers where to help

333
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:10,319
enemies reactive

334
00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:12,509
cybercriminals to attackers to be

335
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:14,879
much more effective in their attacks

336
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,980
not the app is that we are going to find ourselves

337
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,019
in companies they are going to be used

338
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:21,030
in  artificial intelligence a

339
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,790
lot and they will be much more sophisticated

340
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,320
than what we have seen so far

341
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,060
we will not find great software that

342
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,620
will be much more efficient we will

343
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,210
find artificial intelligence models

344
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,620
that will find the way

345
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,270
to sneak into the  company

346
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,470
locating the

347
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,430
chains weeks the weakest links

348
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,560
in the chain and then there is another

349
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,300
part and that is that artificial intelligence

350
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,590
It is going to put into all the

351
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,360
corners of our life it gets into the

352
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,400
mobile phone simply when you are

353
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,770
looking for photographs you can put words

354
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,090
in artificial intelligence models

355
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:53,130
that are organizing your

356
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,050
photographs but it is going to get so much in

357
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:58,140
our life that being able to guarantee that

358
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,600
a  artificial intelligence is not malicious it is

359
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,120
going to be a very complicated discipline.

360
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,120


361
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,880


362
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,940


363
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,410


364
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:14,970


365
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,200


366
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,050
For our benefit and

367
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,420
for the security researchers, it

368
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,640
will seem like a profession that is to audit

369
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,470
the artificial intelligence models

370
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,900
to ensure that they are not malicious

371
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,540
that we do not have the enemy

372
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,830
involved in the artificial interest model of

373
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:35,540
course, as it says yes

374
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,770
indeed in the future  no

375
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:40,590
ramson web with a fairly

376
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,420
powerful model artificial intelligence vamo

377
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,850
Maybe later, as we have the

378
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,160
delta variant of the coi and we are going to

379
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,290
start having deltas variants of ram software

380
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,410
and to protect us, we should

381
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,880
have another type of

382
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,920
artificial intelligence as in youtube to begin

383
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,680
to predict this type of change and the

384
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,700
actions and based  to that, since there is

385
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,380
an artificial intelligence model, you

386
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,430
think that at some point

387
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,980
artificial intelligence could rebel

388
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,080
against us humans, that is,

389
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,980
we believe something

390
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,970
, we have already seen in movies

391
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,470
well the problem of this

392
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,679
dynamics movie when you see there you speak that it jumps

393
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:28,859
and what does parkour do and others do you think

394
00:15:28,859 --> 00:15:31,230
quickly the terminator

395
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,439
can happen anything can happen I am I am a

396
00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:36,209
person with a positivist vision of

397
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:37,559
technology I believe that human beings

398
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:41,549
are capable of learning and

399
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:43,799
using technologies for our

400
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:45,929
benefit I believe  than with nuclear technology

401
00:15:45,929 --> 00:15:48,199
when all scientists

402
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:50,519
practiced that at the end of the 20th century we were

403
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:53,220
not  to survive because we reached

404
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,600
a point where we were able to

405
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,429
understand what the risks were for

406
00:15:56,429 --> 00:15:57,389
humanity

407
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,459
and make a controlled use of nuclear energy

408
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,559
and I think that with artificial intelligence

409
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:02,879
we are going to have to make those

410
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,639
decisions and we are going to have to give ourselves

411
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:08,759
account of where we want us to

412
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,619
apply it and where artificial intelligence should not be applied

413
00:16:10,619 --> 00:16:12,149
there is a

414
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:14,910
current of what we call

415
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,859
humanistic technology where I feel very

416
00:16:16,859 --> 00:16:19,680
recognized that we believe

417
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,260
that technology should be created to

418
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,240
make the lives of people of all  and

419
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,490
each one of them is better by the use

420
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,529
of technology

421
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:30,600
of course, in fact a while ago you were commenting

422
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,950
on artificial intelligence that

423
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,399
we had to avoid bias, there are

424
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:37,230
several studies and videos on the internet that have

425
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:41,100
shown that these models are launched and

426
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,500
effectively it

427
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,020
begins to be  this pseudo discrimination

428
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,930
in the type of person then that is

429
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,910
where we have to base ourselves also and

430
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,339
just as well if we talk  What

431
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:54,810
could be revealed, find us

432
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,510
, could also be violated a

433
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,760
while ago an article by a

434
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,300
German appeared, I don't know if you saw it, that he wanted to

435
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,890
violate all the intelligence that

436
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,550
google maps has to predict the issue

437
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:11,339
of traffic jams, so what did

438
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:14,819
he do  He took a cart in a village war to

439
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:16,890
trace androids to him and I think it was

440
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:20,160
like 90 90 smartphones and what he did

441
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,900
he went down a street where there was

442
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,050
no one and he went with the cart with those 90

443
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:27,449
phones you in google talking very

444
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:30,600
slowly walking very slowly and  Of course I

445
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,390
detect he said that there are many smartphones and they

446
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:36,059
go very slow then the evil began

447
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:38,100
so there was a large parking lot in that

448
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,289
place it began to divert traffic to

449
00:17:40,289 --> 00:17:42,660
other sides then of course in a certain

450
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,910
way we can influence at that

451
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:48,090
time how do you think the author if

452
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:52,580
You can really detect if they are

453
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,740
actually influencing by violating

454
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,660
our model, artificial intelligence algorithm,

455
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,360
well that is the big problem.

456
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,669
not an artificial intelligence learns

457
00:18:02,669 --> 00:18:05,309
because it is more in learning it learns with

458
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:07,789
the data that you give it if you give it

459
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:09,960
fake data as is the case of the

460
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,610
smartphones that carried the cart there

461
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:14,070
to generate a traffic jam that did not

462
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,289
exist and it was also quite curious

463
00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:17,760
because it was  The house where he lived and there was a

464
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,890
lot of noise and then he wanted to see

465
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,659
how the noise of the cars was removed

466
00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:23,970
because you can return it to him and there are

467
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,810
many cases we

468
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,760
do not have an artificial intelligence place you train to act as a

469
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,110
translator and

470
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:32,560
some data from books translated a hundred years ago

471
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,980
years because it will bring you the biases or the

472
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,200
thought that there was pity not

473
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,860
then we have to be extremely

474
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,450
scrupulous in what data

475
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,580
we give to an artificial intelligence

476
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,740
to train it in fact one of the

477
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,990
branches that are making much progress

478
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,490
lately in what is called the  data

479
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:54,340
increases as we generate data to

480
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,460
balance and avoid biases within

481
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,260
the artificial intelligence models

482
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,330
that we are going  to train and if we do not do it

483
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,820
we will have judged or

484
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,380
imperfect models of artificial intelligence

485
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,240
that we can put into

486
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,800
our day-to-day decision-making and that

487
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,780
can be a real risk then

488
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,060
artificial intelligence is a

489
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,800
discipline that has emerged in the

490
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,170
last three, four or five years despite the fact

491
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,850
that they have been with us for more than 50 years

492
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,670
but thanks to cloud computing,

493
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,680
big data and the capabilities of

494
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,930
processing large volumes of data in a

495
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,650
short time

496
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,960
and it has entered our lives and we have

497
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,470
to analyze well take  the

498
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,990
correct decisions and be sure that we are

499
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,160
putting

500
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,110


501
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,880
controlled and audited authorized artificial intelligence models in

502
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,980
the appropriate decision-making so that

503
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,390
our lives harm because we are going to

504
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,850
have a serious risk if I want to and there is a

505
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,250
super important challenge and we can already

506
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,500
see it  in different models of

507
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,930
how the data finally learns or where

508
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:56,000
the inputs of these decision-

509
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,040
making

510
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,540
and t  We have an example for the issue of

511
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,360
bias that I am going to comment on for example

512
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,290
in that same study that they did, which is

513
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:08,930
where it was evidenced that the model had

514
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:12,020
a great bias, especially of machismo racism, it

515
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,750
was because they took data from a

516
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,900
long time ago where it existed  slavery

517
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,700


518
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,350
where machismo is a very powerful thing

519
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,330


520
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,100
that we hope to decrease every

521
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,600
time so what happens is that it takes

522
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,700
all that data and evaluates it in real time

523
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,100
with what happens today in winds he said

524
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,300
ok

525
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,000


526
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,560
black people behave  in this way then it

527
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,080
should not be here so clearly if

528
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,060
they put it it is just a detector to tell

529
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,890
who enters or does not enter a stadium for example

530
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:46,580
a bank and your input is from the

531
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,530
time of slavery that will be

532
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:51,380
quite wrong then you will  to serve

533
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,550
security I believe that

534
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,170
exactly the same thing will happen to us because

535
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,170
vulnerabilities are changing, we have

536
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,960
to update, we look now we are going

537
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,110
to give ourselves some time to read the questions.  As

538
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,780
we have in the chat

539
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,580
there are people who are reading our questions here,

540
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,560
they will also give

541
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,350
tempos to people who are making

542
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:14,900
inquiries so immediately I

543
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,650
recommend everyone to make

544
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,600
their accounts so that they can deliver

545
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,220
and see, look, we will review

546
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,230
according to  Díaz

547
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:29,770
look, what are they going to ask me?

548
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:32,450
There is a comment that says Facebook had

549
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,210
to pay an artificial intelligence

550
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,429
for malicious sharing, you can

551
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,410
be commenting on the issue share the

552
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:42,640
data but

553
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,610
central no longer 9 off

554
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,570
a

555
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:51,330
second, look here if juan carlos molina did I

556
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,700
have information at  Regarding

557
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,970
ransomware, the pdi that has paid a lot in

558
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:00,570
Chile during this 2021 that was born was the

559
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,049
ramson web,

560
00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:06,830
good, the run software is as

561
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,379
everyone knows, it has become

562
00:22:09,379 --> 00:22:10,700
a very easy way for the world of

563
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,460
cybercrime to extort money from

564
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,499
companies.  and make money we have had

565
00:22:15,499 --> 00:22:19,309
many variants of many types and

566
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:21,320
each of the ransomware we tried

567
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,450
security researchers to bu  find the

568
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:27,259
way to decrypt it without end that you have

569
00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:29,269
to pay because if you pay you are

570
00:22:29,269 --> 00:22:31,190
feeding this industry then

571
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,350
any ransomware that appears

572
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:36,429
today the best thing to do is to

573
00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:38,389
report through new new

574
00:22:38,389 --> 00:22:40,850
ramson to

575
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:43,040
try to centralize all the

576
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,180
tools and the  knowledge we

577
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,950
have of all web raps because if

578
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,440
we do a distributed analysis we are

579
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,810
losing strength then this

580
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,610
ransomware just like the others,

581
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,680
researchers are analyzing it, they

582
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,660
are studying it and they are looking for the

583
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:59,390
best way to end it

584
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:01,720
anyway all cybersecurity companies

585
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,770


586
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,600
They have to have a

587
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,490
protection mechanism against run software

588
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,440
called backup management, which

589
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,350
is a discipline that since the 80's

590
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,680
is a shame when a company says

591
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,810
once I don't have the data, the first

592
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:23,750
security rule is copies of

593
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,150
security

594
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,290
but of course now I see

595
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:28,600
[Music]

596
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,180
in this issue like gel how you see the

597
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,430
impact of  smartphone used with

598
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:35,970
attack vectors

599
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:42,659
is a device

600
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:44,580
if the smartphone is a

601
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,799
mobile device that gets into your

602
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,269
home network within the company network

603
00:23:48,269 --> 00:23:50,820
etc. most of the attacks that

604
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,109
are occurring through

605
00:23:52,109 --> 00:23:53,729
smartphones are produced by  means of

606
00:23:53,729 --> 00:23:55,700
malicious apps that have an

607
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,640
excessive set of permissions

608
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,490
that take control of your device and

609
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:03,930
normally attack people's lives,

610
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:06,570
even then they are used to

611
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:10,920
attack organizations in a

612
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,950
targeted way as an app about this

613
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,600
from a talk that  You can search for it on

614
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,210
YouTube called kremlin acz and

615
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:20,430
gremlins botnets it was explained

616
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,620
exactly how

617
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:26,400
these attacks work and luckily or luckily

618
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,610
now in 2021 we begin to see that they

619
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:31,800
are much more robust in terms of

620
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,440
security but we have ten  years

621
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,420
where smartphones have allowed

622
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,950
mobile applications to do what they

623
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:41,130
want to use a mobile application

624
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:43,080
to access your car  It was and you can

625
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,490
take all the photos from your film

626
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:47,640
absolutely all without telling you anything without

627
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,140
any alert or anything you could give

628
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,580
permission to an application is that taking

629
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,190
all your accounts on android

630
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,970
absolutely the list of all

631
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,700
accounts and it has been a shame  I

632
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,250
believe that we have spent ten years

633
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,050
where security in mobile devices

634
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:03,420
that has left much to be desired, now it

635
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,130
seems that we are taking it a little

636
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:08,100
more seriously but we still have to

637
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,290
take very

638
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:12,240
strict precautions with what we install on

639
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,010
our devices, because if not

640
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,030
We can have many personal problems,

641
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:18,270
of course, well, there is also a job

642
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,710
from the developers and the

643
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:22,050
companies at the time they

644
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:24,180
give you this information about what they are going

645
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,400
to obtain, it is more specific because

646
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,260
many times there are those who have not

647
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,430
done it, we are sure we still

648
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:32,190
worry  to give a text but it is a

649
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,960
tremendous papyrus of all the things that are not

650
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,270
going to be done and one unites it.  co you

651
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,010
want is to have the application a child of

652
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:40,440
genes of the following one has already installed it and

653
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,410
acquires everything inside then there is

654
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:46,380
there a problem in fact the real order

655
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,740
the legal policy is quite diffuse do

656
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,530
not get caught you get diabetes uber may

657
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:55,080
or may not access  your location may or may

658
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,270
not share your data with third parties that

659
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,100
those third parties were you believe in the list

660
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,000
on page 27

661
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,150
great look to see to look for a

662
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:09,440
clarification of where it is face up

663
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,320
said about facebook sharing and it was

664
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,730
actually behavior and how it

665
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:17,190
commented that  On Facebook he had to

666
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:19,950
turn off an artificial intelligence

667
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:22,679
to evaluate the behavior of

668
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:24,400
people,

669
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,310
well I think that this is not in line

670
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,630
with the same thing that we just said, that is,

671
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,970
companies are beginning to

672
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:33,450
test these models

673
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:36,790
but that is now a  I

674
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:39,400
experiment most of the times in the case of

675
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,110
facebook with experiments where they said

676
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,790
that they had reached a level of

677
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,620
interaction between them with a

678
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,260
p language  Ropio that no one understood and he knew it was

679
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:50,290
a bit strange it was an experiment and

680
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:53,110
not for the moment it has not had more

681
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,970
repercussion to this day I think it is

682
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:58,510
the true break that we are seeing with

683
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,860
artificial intelligence the point of

684
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:03,040
position we have now is  With

685
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,870
artificial intelligence algorithms

686
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:07,510
based on massive data type touring or

687
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:10,570
gp3 where we are seeing a new level

688
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:13,660
we see the case of cup and batches and hub

689
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:16,510
where it has turned on with all the data of

690
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,490
all the programmers to help you

691
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:21,670
program and that is the let's say  the first

692
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:22,990
step of the new generation of

693
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,970
artificial intelligences that has to

694
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,950
go much slower farther not in

695
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:29,410
ten years we will see where they take us but it

696
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:32,100
will be more impressive it will not be

697
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,900
amazing the growth of the

698
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,179
interstate

699
00:27:37,179 --> 00:27:40,360
is terrific I am busy fasting

700
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,480
which is similar to kuwait lot which is

701
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,700
paid but of course it comes from the

702
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,130
github project and for those who do not know them it is

703
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:50,800
also clear that you can install that

704
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,490
comp  I read it and basically later it

705
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:56,410
begins to learn how you program and

706
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,809
basically it can put 23 letters and

707
00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:00,640
it gives you the whole sentence that the

708
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,440
stigma that it is going to write and it really is

709
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,380
very assertive very assertive gives a little

710
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,929
scare and to the point many are already commenting

711
00:28:07,929 --> 00:28:09,400
that programmers are going to

712
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,440
be out of work but in reality it

713
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,900
is not like that but it is a very interesting help

714
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,890


715
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:18,010
and see that there is another question

716
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:21,140
let me filter that it advances quite fast

717
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:24,500
rodrigo's chat says look what are

718
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,910
the new challenges of auditing the

719
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,220
technologies they use

720
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,060
artificial intelligence and machine

721
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:32,510
learning and consultations there are initiatives

722
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,880
that help to address this type of

723
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,429
technology,

724
00:28:36,429 --> 00:28:40,940
well we are in the great challenge is

725
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,380
that it has learned an

726
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:45,410
artificial intelligence which is the learning of an

727
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:47,060
artificial intelligence in the end

728
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,410
artificial intelligence you give it an

729
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,420
input and vidal has  an answer if in

730
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:53,450
a traditional program a

731
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:56,570
traditional structured training algorithm

732
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:59,360
What you have is data and there is an

733
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,220
internal logic that tells you what

734
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,990
the results are to be reached and

735
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,430
you, as a programmer, can know

736
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,870
exactly, you can

737
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,850
track that algorithm to know what with the

738
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:10,780
input expert

739
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,730
a  artificial intelligence model the

740
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,890
algorithms are so complex that

741
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:18,620
monitoring and explaining that

742
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,780
an artificial intelligence has learned in

743
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,910
vast data is very difficult to

744
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:25,150
audit josh is the great challenge is to

745
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:27,290
explain what artificial intelligence learned

746
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:29,720
because we saw it we had

747
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,130
too many  recently in the world

748
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:32,960
of medicine you do not have

749
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,730
artificial intelligence the world of medicine with

750
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:35,870
tools that are telling a

751
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:37,790
surgeon to cut this way is in a video

752
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:40,490
of the heart and they tell him to cut it here

753
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,590
in a trial the judge would ask him  to the

754
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,390
doctor because you have cut out

755
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:46,310
there has behaved the patient has died

756
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,050
because it has cost you carried for the

757
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:50,180
doctor I would say well look put  I saw that I

758
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,700
had a thrombus in this part, so I

759
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,680
tried to eliminate pressure by

760
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,950
cutting in this place, etc. and such and such and

761
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:00,710
then if the explanation of why he

762
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:03,740
made that decision is credible,

763
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,330
the judge would say ok but you imagine what

764
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:07,520
the doctor says I don't know  I cut broadcast

765
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,610
according

766
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,590
to jail

767
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,390
exactly to jail 3 which is an

768
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:15,520
artificial intelligence model that

769
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,640
will help a doctor

770
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,620
make a decision when it comes to surgery

771
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,140
and cut will have to be able to explain

772
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,510
why he has made that decision  It will not have to

773
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:28,029
be explicable and today the

774
00:30:28,029 --> 00:30:29,710
reality is that we do not know between we

775
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:30,850
give data to the introduction of

776
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:32,320
artificial basile algorithms are

777
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,390
learned but we are not very clear about what

778
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,940
has learned and why it has learned that

779
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:39,340
then it is the great challenge  What we have in

780
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,350
short, such as how we explain the

781
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,700
learning of an

782
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,919
artificial intelligence and how we guarantee that what

783
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:45,970
an artificial intelligence has learned

784
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,669
is correct is to be adequate

785
00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:50,409
not ap  rendered that it is a zebra it is a

786
00:30:50,409 --> 00:30:52,450
horse as it has learned to differentiate

787
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,059
what google put an example in which it

788
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:57,700
put an artificial intelligence to

789
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,279
recognize professions in photographs and

790
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:02,649
the learning that it had was if it wore

791
00:31:02,649 --> 00:31:05,049
a white coat a stethoscope and it is a man

792
00:31:05,049 --> 00:31:07,600
is a doctor

793
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,070
if it is  The man wore a white coat and

794
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:14,490
a nurse,

795
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,289
let's talk to the dry man too and

796
00:31:19,289 --> 00:31:22,169
finally this that until today

797
00:31:22,169 --> 00:31:23,760
artificial intelligence something that

798
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,510
you are basically going to create and you launch what is

799
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,250
going to happen

800
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:31,650
I do not know for our security, look here

801
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:33,110
for the question,

802
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:35,640
what is it?  your vision for the future

803
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,760
regarding quantum computing

804
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,630
applied to artificial intelligence

805
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,910
well quantum computing still has

806
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:46,490
a few years left we are not

807
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:49,000
in a very incipient period right now

808
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,560
where we are talking about

809
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,510
computers with few qubits

810
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,450
we are still far

811
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:57,700
from being a computer  a

812
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,130
fully functional team but by the time

813
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:01,480
they get the quantum computers

814
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,179
within 10  15 years that are fully

815
00:32:04,179 --> 00:32:06,909
functional I think it will be a

816
00:32:06,909 --> 00:32:08,500
brutal transformation we will be able to

817
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,720
train an artificial intelligence model

818
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,929
at an incredible speed and

819
00:32:13,929 --> 00:32:17,170
we will be able

820
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:19,450
to make an artificial intelligence

821
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:21,580
learn what a human being learns I

822
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:25,210
do not know 30 years  life of the garment in a

823
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,430
day in an hour in 10 minutes no I do not

824
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:30,910
know then we are going to find a

825
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,830
new world where we are going to have to

826
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,900
assume that that point of singularity

827
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,700
where we go technology or

828
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,230
artificial intelligence is going to be capable

829
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:41,020
to have more intelligence than all

830
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,840
human beings together because it will arrive

831
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,060
then we will have to learn to live

832
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,800
with them it will be a new technology

833
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,410
a new a new moment in the history

834
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:52,240
of humanity and we will have to learn

835
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,620
to live with them if the questions  and

836
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,830
speaking as what assembles in the topic

837
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:03,010
of the surgeon can also be with

838
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:05,140
what google did in the matter of the

839
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,750
errors and says who would be responsible

840
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,490
for  the mistakes that artificial intelligence makes

841
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,860


842
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,810
now this is a classic debate who is

843
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:16,300
the error when a plane crashes

844
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,340
due to a computer problem in

845
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:21,980
artificial social intelligent software

846
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,750
there is a very good book that I really like

847
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,850
by bruce schneier called

848
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:28,340
click here to kill them all that

849
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,440
speaks precisely about this and it is true

850
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,510
that we have to improve

851
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,190
responsibility in the

852
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:36,380
software industry we cannot put that all the

853
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,419
software projects that we deliver

854
00:33:38,419 --> 00:33:40,940
deliver asics without any

855
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,130
responsibility I think we have to

856
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:47,580
address that of  the regulation of the queue

857
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,880
and the law have to make

858
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,280
the technology that is delivered is of

859
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,490
higher quality and that there are at least

860
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:57,990
some types of software that are

861
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:00,180
used by certain sites that

862
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,710
greatly impact people's lives

863
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:04,110
have some  responsibility the debate

864
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,850
is open in artificial intelligence

865
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:09,750
is even more important

866
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,580
but hey I like it a lot  or the vision of

867
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,219
bruce schneier in en click here to

868
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,050
kill them all which is a book that I

869
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,850
recommend to everyone to read why

870
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:20,029


871
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,139
the proposal he makes to

872
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:23,909


873
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:27,040
hold the companies that create the software responsible for

874
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,290
having taken the most reasonable measures

875
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:32,850
and

876
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:35,350
correct to secure systems

877
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:37,389
without going so far as to list what

878
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:39,730
to do is probably

879
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:42,070
the most successful I think it is an

880
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,389
open debate that people can read the

881
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:45,520
book and reflect because it is very

882
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,429
interesting and I think we have to

883
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:50,560
work on it  Even as a society, yes of course,

884
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,239
look based on that same book

885
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,620
that you recommend, there is also a question

886
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,230


887
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:59,050
that many people are adding to

888
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:01,480
this world of cybersecurity and

889
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,760
our question always appears on what is

890
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,670
possible, mainly from how

891
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,440
we can start in cybersecurity how

892
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,990
We can improve someone who

893
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:13,440
has actually found it,

894
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,060
I think there you have quite a few

895
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:18,370
gigs with 10 x work,

896
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:21,700
but there is a theme there.  A very

897
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,530
curious issue in the world of activating

898
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:26,740
security is that cybersecurity is a

899
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,420
mature profession where there are very different roles,

900
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,610
it is not the same to work

901
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:33,610
as a pen tester in the

902
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:35,550
reptile team where you need creativity

903
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,590
spontaneity behind being a

904
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:41,110
security quad in  The team that before

905
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,730
the product comes out in production has

906
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:45,010
to have it assured that it is a forensic

907
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,990
that be in a say that be in a

908
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:49,900
show managing the alert that it is in

909
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,180
a post-morten equipment that is in the

910
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,040
blood and not in the  audit team that

911
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,460
being a flat there are many roles in

912
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,230
cybersecurity and what you cannot see

913
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,400
what happens is that many times the

914
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,330
kids enter the world of

915
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:04,990
cybersecurity and they do not know well what is

916
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:07,660
the area where their abilities and

917
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,030
skills are going to be more relevant  It

918
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,920
is not the same in one area you will have to

919
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,990
have communication skills in

920
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:15,550
us, not in others you have to be very

921
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,840
creative you do not have to be very

922
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:20,220
mechanical in others you have  I know that it is very,

923
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,319
as I would say, very teamwork at the

924
00:36:23,319 --> 00:36:25,359
time of others, you have to create a team in

925
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,549
others, it can be lonely,

926
00:36:27,549 --> 00:36:29,799


927
00:36:29,799 --> 00:36:31,900


928
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,900


929
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,910
etc.  For a

930
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:40,299
whole day, people are tested for intelligence

931
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:41,979
and skills and

932
00:36:41,979 --> 00:36:43,390
abilities and then we tell them if you want to

933
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:45,400
work in cybersecurity,

934
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,900
you will probably be better in this profession,

935
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:50,140
this one and this one, to put them but

936
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,390
there is no but you don't have to get involved.  in

937
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:54,400
cybersecurity thinking that you are going to be a

938
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,319
researcher or that you are going to be a pen tester

939
00:36:56,319 --> 00:36:58,950
or that you are going to be in a

940
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,390
regulatory compliance team because the world

941
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:02,650
of diversity has many roles

942
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:05,619
you have to know what

943
00:37:05,619 --> 00:37:07,269
best suits you and  then when looking for

944
00:37:07,269 --> 00:37:10,329
work orient yourself towards this role if it is not

945
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:12,309
enough to generate your illustration then the

946
00:37:12,309 --> 00:37:15,160
rest is therefore to work in the

947
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,769
sense of studying practice studying

948
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:19,720
to practice this try there is a conference

949
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,950
that is on youtube that you can

950
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:23,380
see called your future since in your future

951
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:26,410
I live where I told my story

952
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,390
what I recommend to people so that

953
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:29,920
they can do well in the world of

954
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,440
technology in  General and

955
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,230
cybersecurity in particular, yes of course,

956
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:37,720
look at Cristian Leiva in the question saying

957
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,490
that you could tell us about net

958
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:42,619
neural network and deep learning.

959
00:37:42,619 --> 00:37:46,369
Well, in the end, we are talking about

960
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:48,349
artificial intelligence or artificial intelligence algorithms.

961
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,809
We have seen a

962
00:37:50,809 --> 00:37:53,990
lot of growth in theory.  of the

963
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:55,670
algorithms artificial intelligence the

964
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:58,460
right ons learning dave learning we have

965
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:02,690
seen after the guns where we confront

966
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:05,210
a great a neural network against another

967
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:07,279
neural network so that one fools others

968
00:38:07,279 --> 00:38:10,609
are we are talking about a science that

969
00:38:10,609 --> 00:38:12,920
is evolving very fast such as that

970
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,420
of  artificial intelligence with two

971
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:17,349


972
00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:19,430
spectacular algorithms in recent years and that we will continue to

973
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:22,839
see that they steal  To

974
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:25,430
change, new ones will not appear, as is

975
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:29,059
the case of gp3 turin and new

976
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:30,650
algorithms that will use other

977
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:32,329
technologies to generate that

978
00:38:32,329 --> 00:38:34,700
artificial intelligence.

979
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,700


980
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,630


981
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:43,120
that

982
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,730
Latin America lacks to increase the level of

983
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:48,890
maturity in cybersecurity

984
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:50,780
I believe that nothing is lacking, that is,

985
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:54,380
what is lacking is that people believe it

986
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:58,370
and work and remove the complexes

987
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:00,920
not many times in which it prevents

988
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,200
a  person succeeded in a certain

989
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,690
area is the famous glass ceiling that

990
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:07,880
you put on yourself Latin America has

991
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,670
good good hackers has

992
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,710
good companies has good

993
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:15,470
internet connections with which it has the level

994
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:17,540
of everything and then you have to fight

995
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,990
obviously it is neither  Latin America or

996
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:22,870
Spain the silicon valley flavor that

997
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:25,550
venture 'wílder has those capital breasts with

998
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:28,510
so many millions of euros but it does

999
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:30,680
n't matter you don't need all that money to

1000
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,330
building a facebook

1001
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,730
facebook started in their room and

1002
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:37,490
google starting in their room

1003
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:39,020
what people have to do is

1004
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,700
take off the complex and move

1005
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,430
forward and that's it if you come and see that

1006
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,350
there is one more query towards a

1007
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:49,070
specific area than them  They consult sandoval

1008
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:51,740
says that security aspects we must

1009
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:54,680
address in the retail sector in 2021

1010
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,440
2022

1011
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:00,980
in the retail sector what they have

1012
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:05,270
to talk about is online fraud and

1013
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:07,970
online shopping or in the retail sector

1014
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:10,430
has been transformed by the

1015
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:13,310
pandemic  where it has forced

1016
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:16,660
all its sales flow models to pass to

1017
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:20,420
a purely digital model based on

1018
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,520
what the work that amazon has done in

1019
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,760
e-commerce and what it has to do is

1020
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,140
transform and digitize

1021
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,300
absolutely all processes and take

1022
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,400
into account then  what are you going to have to eat

1023
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,140
get money are you going to have customers

1024
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,320
card cards means of payment

1025
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,850
etc. that are going to be very sweet

1026
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:39,620
to cybercriminals are you going to have

1027
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:42,050
Phishing attacks Impersonation attack you are going to

1028
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:43,550
have stores attacks johnny

1029
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:46,280
denial of service of your

1030
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,810
sales flow because they are going to try to pull the

1031
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:49,680
fronts you are going to have

1032
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,960
a robot to attempt to steal data etc

1033
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:55,079
then that is the retail sector has

1034
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:56,700
to transform  very seriously towards

1035
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,950
a and commerce and having a

1036
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:02,670
robust and secure digital and eat requires a lot of

1037
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:05,040
cybersecurity work in many areas from

1038
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,930
identity management to spoofing

1039
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:09,089
the response to incidents in the

1040
00:41:09,089 --> 00:41:12,990
means of payment bolton and look said you

1041
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:15,089
have a very very query  Based on what

1042
00:41:15,089 --> 00:41:17,460
I was talking about, say under your

1043
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,890
estimate what percentage of the internet is

1044
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:22,950
approached by bots that clearly one of

1045
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:24,720
the things that most impact retail

1046
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,599
is bots,

1047
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:29,489
I wouldn't know how to tell you that the internet is

1048
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:31,829
growing day by day and anyone who

1049
00:41:31,829 --> 00:41:32,869
gets a

1050
00:41:32,869 --> 00:41:35,759
one  number like this is to put your finger in the

1051
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:38,009
air and see it but very large there are many it

1052
00:41:38,009 --> 00:41:40,380
is true that the automatic processes

1053
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,319
are very high there are many  bots we have

1054
00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:47,789
many is to know we overcome the

1055
00:41:47,789 --> 00:41:51,359
denial of service attack of larger size

1056
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,459
no and it is precisely because of this because the

1057
00:41:53,459 --> 00:41:55,259
internet expands it expands it

1058
00:41:55,259 --> 00:41:58,319
expands like the universe not clear the

1059
00:41:58,319 --> 00:41:59,609
posters of no time can

1060
00:41:59,609 --> 00:42:02,279
increase but that is a change of

1061
00:42:02,279 --> 00:42:04,349
climate  I'm going to increase some time

1062
00:42:04,349 --> 00:42:06,239
after working, so we can't

1063
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:08,549
trust that, retail ends and

1064
00:42:08,549 --> 00:42:11,670
what happens a lot is that they care a

1065
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,619
lot about the products that have the stock

1066
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:16,410
and the value that someone might want to

1067
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:18,569
launch a campaign against

1068
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:21,329
the  competition to see what value

1069
00:42:21,329 --> 00:42:25,170
such a product or another has, look and here Cristian

1070
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:28,439
in helmand asks us he says he

1071
00:42:28,439 --> 00:42:30,319
agrees to do a psychological test

1072
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:32,910
before assuming responsibility in

1073
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:35,320
cybersecurity

1074
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,320
question

1075
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,440
I think that the interviews are just a

1076
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,020
test of psychological capacities of everything

1077
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,150
I believe  that all companies have a

1078
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:49,910
personality test and that I do not know if it is

1079
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:51,880
a psychological test but at least

1080
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:55,460
if a test stops for v  er what kind of

1081
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,440
person is it that you want to put in

1082
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,170
your company is not important yes of course and

1083
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:02,870
above all that there is always a

1084
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:04,490
very thin line between the good side and

1085
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:06,640
the bad side

1086
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,310
come the last question let's go we have

1087
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:13,150

rodrigo says I would appreciate the issue if

1094

you can comment on this

measure to the public the service

offered at the haq lapse

1097

service of  companies if it is not going to open

1099
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:50,170
to the general public for now, but

1100
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:52,509
well, we'll see, you never know right

1101
00:43:52,509 --> 00:43:55,119
now, and the event has

been rebranding, it is no longer elevated peace as

1103

such, now it is part of telefonica tech, it is

1104
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:02,019
a much larger company  where we have

1105
00:44:02,019 --> 00:44:04,180
joined all the telephone equipment of the
