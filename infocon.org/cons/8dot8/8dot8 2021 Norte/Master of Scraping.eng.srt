00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:15,030
and yes

00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,289
well

[Music]

5
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,320
yes

6
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,680
and we are back 6 minutes 5 minutes

7
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,330
is not so much to wait and continue with

8
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:53,970
our beloved content agenda

00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,500
designed for you who are from your

10
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,990
home from a cafe from

11
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,400
anywhere because virtuality allows us

12
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,630
This is to try to centralize information,

13
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,100
we are open to all regions,

14
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,740
although it is called the northern region, we are

15
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,480
open to the world, we have had

16
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,430
notable conferences so far and

17
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,040
this work continues, which

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,450
you could have clearly informed yourself

19
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,830
because we are in almost all the media,

20
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,690
I want to emphasize that  That work before

21
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,460
we pass our dear guest

22
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,200
I want to emphasize that the

23
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,360
communications work and the work in which

24
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,560
you suddenly catch us in the

25
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,229

00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:32,979
journalists working in cybersecurity

30
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:34,690
magín is that going crazy  Knowing or

31
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:35,950
trying to decipher the codes to be

32
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,900
able to publish it here, they are present in

33
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,210
8.8 and they are part of our team

34
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,130

35
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:44,140
small dance, we are now going

36
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,760

52
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,430
interests me no more but I would like to

53
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,300

exact ideal then I leave you fernando the

62
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,090
scenario of 8.8 regional north is for

00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,630
first of all good afternoon everyone

67
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,840
everyone is connected

68
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,120
played  right at lunch so he will

69
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,900
try to do it well

70
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,140
we will start by presenting the

71
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:21,940
shared screen and presenting the

72
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:27,069
famous lights that I prepared

73
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,640
if any of you previous talk in

74
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,830
another conference it might be almost

75
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,989
the same but the idea of now showing

76
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:37,580
others try additional concepts

77
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,270


78
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:43,010
e mode of presentation

79
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,050
my name is fernando lagos

80
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,900
I am founder of the

81
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,030
level 4 security company and currently I am

82
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,370
basically dedicated to giving advice and consulting

83
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,250
on security issues

84
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:00,030
and the idea of being able to present at this

85
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,290
conference which is not the first time that we

86
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,880
present at this  type of conference

87
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,880
supporting the dissemination of knowledge is to be

88
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,100
able to give you some guidelines give

89
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,220
some  s comments and some

90
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,750
demonstrations and also share part

91
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,540
of the knowledge so that we know a

92
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,579
little more about scraping and the

93
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,529
talks are called master or scraping

94
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:22,019
basically because what I am looking for is to

95
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,750
teach the phases that do scraping and

96
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,220
the lack of controls that exist

97
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,100
today  and in most of the sites

98
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,660
we are going to see some

99
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,580
example sites and also obviously as this

100
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,880
is to be able to contribute I will indicate certain

101
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,590
things about how it should be able to mitigate it

102
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,140
is good excuse that ending more

103
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,530
outside that I have jobs as if it

104
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,429
were not  looking at the bed

105
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:51,500
for the agenda the agenda of this talk

106
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,240
is first to talk about bach and because

107
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,890
all this scraping all the

108
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,220
screaming techniques we are going to do it

109
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,990
using batch using commands simply

110
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,420
if you do not use any special software

111
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,250
we are not going to support the browser in the

112
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,080
developer tools we are going to

113
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,930
see this sentence being copied we are going to

114
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,790
execute the euro to write and create a

115
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,430
vam script  We are also going to talk about the

116
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,170
commands, that is to say which commands are the

117
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,450
ones I used or which one I recommend to

118
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,670
make the slave, we are not going to lose we

119
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,620
are not going to lose any language an advertisement

120
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,350
simply script in empacho we are going to

121
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,140
use and we are going to also use cool  In order

122
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,970
to execute the requests and

123
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,210
partial power of the websites, we are going to

124
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,920
scripting directly and we are going to apply

125
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,600
a technique called kosher, which is

126
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,820
the recognition of images, that is,

127
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,010
transforming an image into text, removing

128
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,540
the texts that can be seen between an

129
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,850
image and  you can transform the

130
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,920
text to clear text so to speak to be able to

131
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,200
wake up to meet having a base

132
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,180
is not that we not only elaborate something to

133
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,770
do 12 efe but we are going to a command

134
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,750
that allows us to retro image extract

135
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,030
the text and then I am going to talk to you

136
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,040
about a small disclaimer and we will

137
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,360
talk about the privacy of these

138
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,990
sites and the risks that there are will begin to be

139
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,640
published in all kinds of information

140
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,730
some sites co  As a marketplace

141
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,350
we are going to a demonstration where we are going to be

142
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,090
able to see how this data is extracted how

143
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:16,510
easy it is easy in quotes and the

144
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,950
recommendation obviously so that this

145
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:21,100
does not happen are recommendations more than

146
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,410
anything for programmers for people

147
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,420
who develop how you have to

148
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,590
apply it from  a security mechanism

149
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,590
to avoid screaming how

150
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,060
important it is to understand how scraping is done

151
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,820
how a person thinks to

152
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,020
achieve the corresponding download

153
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,110
of that particular data how this is

154
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,180
automated so that it

155
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,450
can be prevented because many times

156
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,530
we try  prevent things but we

157
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,880
do not know very well what the attack consists of

158
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,720


159
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,160
until we put in quotes because I do not know

160
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,960
if scrabble can be considered an

161
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,960
attack

162
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,110
then we think we start with

163
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,970
panties I think everyone already knows what

164
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,550
it is for everyone at some point they have

165
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,020
worked with back or  finally

166
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,870
the hooks sound

167
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,210
basically a command interpreter is

168
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,330
a better version  Prayer of sh if you want

169
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,580
its predecessor and bach to populate its

170
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,940
improved there are other other

171
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,590
command interpreters that are much better that

172
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,240
will have different functionalities or are

173
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,230
more current such as sts h but it

174
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,850
is a matter of tastes of things like that

175
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,740
custom is  You can do exactly the

176
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,260
same thing that basically is to join commands to

177
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,130
work with the output of a command and

178
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,750
process it and that delivers a car and

179
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,850
then or working also partially it

180
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:38,160
removes it in a new variable finally

181
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,590
is to be able to work with the processes the

182
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,900
commands that allow interpreting orders

183
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,060
and  executing commands programs it is also

184
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,070
possible to create using operators

185
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,930
loops as a minimum example the nation

186
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,040
so to speak

187
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,320
then this way we can analyze a

188
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,240
string make a file we can

189
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,560
analyze a binary and use

190
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,850
attractions depending on the analytics

191
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,000
branches then batch will allow us to do

192
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,480
this

193
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,370
first let's see  about the two

194
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,750
operators what we are going to do let's

195
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,030
talk about  e bach what

196
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,860
is how this script is built and then

197
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,890
directly show an example

198
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,570
batch operators allow us to

199
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,190
perform mind operations because

200
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:18,130
for operators or comparisons to be

201
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,680
able to create a writing in certain logic

202
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,450
for example we have a text file

203
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,700
that has  a lot of information for example

204
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,800
we have muse sb or we have a flat and

205
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,420
through these planes and we

206
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,950
want to execute a command but

207
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,750
we believe that this command depends on the

208
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,809
content of that file

209
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:36,490
so we start using commands like

210
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,890
catch for example like greg and we

211
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:41,350
start using the operators by  example and

212
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,830
we start to play with oscar and we

213
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:47,350
ask for example if we make a

214
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,970
group to a phone number or a

215
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,340
horror and the coincidence is correct that is to

216
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,720
say the number of being active was

217
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,060
executed and attraction and that is done

218
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,220
based on and there is also it  because

219
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,140
there are the different loops that

220
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,059
the programming language exists,

221
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:02,829
what we want to do is simply  e

222
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:04,989
execute a command execute something

223
00:09:04,989 --> 00:09:09,039
based on an input and that could be a this

224
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:11,679
topic was a file whatever for

225
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,009
example

226
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:17,949
we have operators that are for example

227
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:20,170
script 7 which means is greater than

228
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:22,779
then we have the worst 15 than if 5 is

229
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:26,949
greater than  1 then I return 1 then I

230
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:30,220
return 5 is greater than one and

231
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,829
that command was executed effectively it

232
00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:34,660
shows me in console 5 is greater than

233
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,439
good if I have another sentence that says 5

234
00:09:37,439 --> 00:09:42,009
lt one that is less than I put 5 less

235
00:09:42,009 --> 00:09:46,240
than 1 but the one of the  sentence is if I

236
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,740
do not have one it is less than 5 in this case it

237
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,420
says one less than 5 because the first

238
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,080
condition is obviously not met

239
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,670
then we have an operator that

240
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,410
allows us to read a file for example

241
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,600
since the script is initial that is the

242
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,970
file exists not  it exists and if it exists it

243
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,520
executed a sentence if it does not exist it

244
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,310
executed another and finally based on the

245
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,990
different and the different operators

246
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,600
that we can execute under this sentence

247
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,720
and we are adjusting this action and we can

248
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,140
go testing p  For example, if if you have

249
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,730
a max album, place an expression to

250
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,590
regulate the file name has

251
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:25,260
a ship with some strange if the

252
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,350
content of the file or if the execution

253
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:32,310
of a command returns a result that

254
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,450
matches what we are

255
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,430
looking for, that is, we can  use for

256
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,769
whatever

257
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,569
we can calculate dates for example I

258
00:10:38,569 --> 00:10:42,860
can assume that I calculated if

259
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,480
today's date is greater than the date that

260
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,920
we have some file based on that

261
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,199
play this action only as it is

262
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:49,910
like a mini programming language but

263
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,499
it is not compiled  but it is interpreted

264
00:10:51,499 --> 00:10:53,540
and it is much more limited with a programming language

265
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,459
, functions can be created,

266
00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:57,499
it is not object-oriented, obviously,

267
00:10:57,499 --> 00:11:00,949
but it is quite robust and

268
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:02,199
you have to have a lot of imagination

269
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:05,239
logistically with any command by

270
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:07,420
any program you can write it

271
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,370
and that's what we're going to do.  Let's try to see

272
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,550
today well there are also logical operators

273
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:15,160
we can use the famous one but it

274
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,080
is logical that  that I remember when

275
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,730
we are in school where they

276
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:22,540
taught us about logic, that is,

277
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,290
when we have to assess something that was

278
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,900
training, no but we don't have to do

279
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,450
if we have a positive and a positive, a

280
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:36,250
negative and a negative, we have one and

281
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,230
we have one.  one and one and how

282
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,780
that logic is turning out for us then

283
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,750
we all know that if we have two and the

284
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,510
result is positive so to speak it is

285
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:50,260
true and thus we have a true or

286
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,360
false the result is also true

287
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,640
if we have a false a false we go

288
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,350
when with that logic  Also and that

289
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,270
logic is applied in the execution of the

290
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,930
commands, for example we have the logic

291
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,329
as the front

292
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:05,369
but they are is a and I can execute a

293
00:12:05,369 --> 00:12:08,220
command put am person to person and

294
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,129
another command and this logical sentence is going to be executed

295
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:13,860
no longer means  so

296
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,259
if command 1 is executed for a

297
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:18,720
true sanity so to speak with

298
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,649
a successful exit status and command

299
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:24,749
2 also then executed something for

300
00:12:24,749 --> 00:12:27,389
example if the command  1 that in this

301
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:29,509
case command 1 is not executed correctly,

302
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:32,459
the second is not going to be executed because

303
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:34,860
automatically as the first

304
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,259
value is false, the sentence is not already false,

305
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:39,600
we also have the operator that is the

306
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,290
double pipe that it would be and then we have

307
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,749
the command  one for command two in

308
00:12:45,749 --> 00:12:48,689
this case yes if command 1 is not

309
00:12:48,689 --> 00:12:51,299
executed it does not matter which universe command to

310
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:53,339
execute then in this way we

311
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,929
can condition the execution of a

312
00:12:54,929 --> 00:12:56,879
command then we can say that if a

313
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:59,260
command is executed incorrectly

314
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,200
because I don't know  For example, it did not find the

315
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,270
world match or because the command does not

316
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,090
exist or because it is taking it is badly

317
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,620
designed, so to speak, it has some

318
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,480
parameter of the carbon and obstetrician is not going

319
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,310
to execute and go if, for example,

320
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:16,240
buying like any console I

321
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,310
can tell the  match that if the first one is

322
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,140
not executed, the second one is executed in that

323
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,370
way we can condition

324
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,350
information restricting gant with with

325
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,240
ampersand with pipe say that if it has  or

326
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,650
it is not executed that the second second is counted

327
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,510
if it is executed then that

328
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,280
the third is judged and so I am going to build a

329
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,750
giant stream it

330
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,370
is simply by giving it logic the three

331
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,670
create for example

332
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,470
the first line that says echo command 1

333
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:41,320
am person character command 2

334
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,480
we continue  from 1 and 2 is joined because the

335
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,610
first one was executed successfully I

336
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,070
made the second sentence in the city

337
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,840
existence write a command that does not

338
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,420
exist to write echo but with four

339
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,370
it brought that when it does not exist been

340
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,500
executed and taking shape then I

341
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,950
say  that co with the chop command 1 am

342
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,780
person ampersand echo command 2

343
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,060
and it is like all those executed,

344
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,270
only the first one was joined but it showed

345
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:11,710
a result that says eat tells us

346
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:14,090
the sentence is not fulfilled and the second is

347
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,850
not executed

348
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:19,930
the third example says echo  command 1 bye

349
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,649
bye which is the off echo command 2 in this

350
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:25,480
case is to execute as act 1 and circuits

351
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,220
form successful then the system will not

352
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,069
execute the second command anymore

353
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,199
however  If you ran the same command

354
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:34,509
above echo but with more work

355
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:37,029
that returns the plot with the first

356
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:39,579
command it is not executed and since

357
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:41,589
the first one was not executed the second will be executed

358
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,360
then this way we are going to

359
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,860
condition the execution of the command

360
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,870
depending on the status of  followed by

361
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,329
the previous command that as the important thing

362
00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:51,880
to understand about this logic that we are going to

363
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,240
start giving our system

364
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,680
these famous logical operators that the

365
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,949
company and the pipe

366
00:14:58,949 --> 00:15:02,319
obey the famous success status,

367
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:03,850
that is, to the exit status that the

368
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,319
commands have the programs all the

369
00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:06,910
programs all commands have an

370
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,150
exit status

371
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,340
for example of segmentation foul the

372
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,990
typical graveyard because we find

373
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:16,230
when a system a program fails

374
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,880
so to speak because we lack some type

375
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,560
of validation or because

376
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,840
the system simply crashes well it was exit to

377
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,850
it for example  we are giving cards

378
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,800
so much being firefox it directly

379
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,830
hangs and falls that also we close

380
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,750
a is  exit status and that is

381
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,540
exit status are defined by each program

382
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,280
if the exit status

383
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,640
is true so to speak it means

384
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,410
that the program ran fine and the xxi

385
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,900
status is 0 perfect then it means

386
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,090
that it was executed on Friday if my ex and status

387
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:48,450
have a  idea for example 567 it could be

388
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,130
that it is due to some error for example it

389
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,680
was executed to a host that

390
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,550
does not exist yet it was output x since it

391
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,650
may be this output 20 and if you go to

392
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,690
kurt's manual it says that it was output

393
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,940
20

394
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,060
you have means  that the hot does not respond

395
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,610
does not mean that the protocol does not exist

396
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:11,160
or it means that it is a closed port and that

397
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,970
is defined by each program

398
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,520
and

399
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,700
in pothole there is an

400
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,380
operator so to speak that allows

401
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,020
access to the output status of the tucu

402
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,540
command executed which is and not weights  and it does not

403
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,140
ask anymore then for example I

404
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,940
can make an entry I can search

405
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,610
within one of a string or within

406
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:35,130
a file for a match if the

407
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:38,540
consciousness exists serious it

408
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,070
will end with state d  e results

409
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,840
but if not with one then I can

410
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,400
do a go then I say that

411
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,970
if the grec executes previously

412
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:53,610
is equal to zero then just

413
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:57,030
write me and it is equal to 1 then as

414
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,830
everything written depending on the case

415
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,840
then this this operate it to

416
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,610
allow access to the  exit status of the

417
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,589
last command executed and based on that

418
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:07,839
we can do certain actions,

419
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,359
for example if we execute the sentence

420
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:13,539
heals a judge that does not exist, it tells me that

421
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:15,339
it cannot resolve the host because

422
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:17,140
obviously host with a low that does not exist

423
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,049
does not exist and if we see  the last

424
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:22,099
exit status 6

425
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:24,410
and according to the manual of kurt 6 means

426
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:28,400
that the same sentence does not exist,

427
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,370
but it executed the local host

428
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:34,070
and then only the dollar sign and it

429
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,960
does not ask me why because it was

430
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,030
executed correctly because the helmets

431
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,650
exist  The protocol is fine and it was possible to

432
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,630
connect and finally the

433
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,640
full utility so that it will

434
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,000
show us on the screen but

435
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,350
the output status is when it is cer  Or

436
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,760
that is, it was executed correctly

437
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,280
then based on this and with it and if you

438
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,900
cannot play you can execute any

439
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,900
this sector was executed for two days

440
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,240
so I was seriously wrong and

441
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,010
based on that we are assembling our

442
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:03,320
logic of the  script as I mentioned

443
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,809
according to the manual of kun the 6 means

444
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:08,270
that you cannot solve the cost and that is

445
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,890
defined by each program there is not a standard

446
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:12,070
so to speak I can program a

447
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,419
tool for example

448
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:17,419
sepla if you can tell it that if it does not

449
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:20,390
work poorly for me  exit the program

450
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,030
I do not know with an idea and 5 and in my hand

451
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,470
I say that the 5 corresponds that

452
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,809
these things do not play but it is always zero

453
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:29,299
to make the program run

454
00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:31,009
well that there was no problem with its

455
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,850
output,

456
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,870
good as I mentioned

457
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:38,260
also long ago there are also countries the double

458
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:42,520
country is in the sentence to evaluate one

459
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,630
sentence or the other

460
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:48,500
the simple one only for the famous the

461
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,880
famous expert

462
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,740
serves to work the outputs of the

463
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,800
command  s through a pipeline you

464
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,040
can eat all the command that it

465
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,590
returned and use it as input for another

466
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,020
command that is to say that we leave behind or

467
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,510
never a file to put the pay

468
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,540
graft and a sentence what it will do

469
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,370
is that all the output of the  command k

470
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:12,620
file is going to happen to believe so

471
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,040
that the maple

472
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,440
is to say the output a file that serves

473
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,570
to work as input of another command

474
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,850
basically is as it appears in the

475
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:24,600
example that command one or forgave a hundred

476
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,210
in which country command two the spd

477
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,550
command two will be the headquarters of command one,

478
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,530
that is to say that starting everything that

479
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,910
command one returned to me and this I am

480
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,710
passing as an argument to command number

481
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:35,830
2

482
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,450
we also have the operators that are

483
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,909
greater than is less than and also double

484
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:41,620
greater than and  Double minor you want already

485
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,970
when working in a file this is

486
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,010
quite useful because it allows us, for

487
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:48,039
example, to redirect the output of some

488
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:50,070
file the

489
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:53,309
greater symbol who will allow us to

490
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:56,950
save all the points in a file  ivo and

491
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,140
it was archived there are going to delete its

492
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,000
content if I do not want it to limit its

493
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,799
content I have to add the double

494
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,250
greater than when the double greater who

495
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,590
and incidentally a file will not add as

496
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,909
the end of the file will not

497
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:11,919
replace the  file

498
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,840
and obviously it is for the other side,

499
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,820
but the smallest that will be used to read

500
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,500
a file, that is, for the

501
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,630
content of a file to decide how to give

502
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:22,980
as input for my command,

503
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:27,049
we are also seeing the loops,

504
00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:29,419
which are basically the wide forms,

505
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:31,070
that is,  iterations that I can

506
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,289
run in my script until it is

507
00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:35,029
met or until this condition is no longer met,

508
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:38,210
it may be that I

509
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,159
have 20 lines active and I am going to

510
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,899
make a loop for each line then

511
00:20:41,899 --> 00:20:43,659
for each line of the file

512
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,309
and  That is to do by creating a volcano with a

513
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:50,119
loop that is greater than Bombay, those

514
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:52,239
are the useful ones, basically,

515
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:55,779
for example we have the forum

516
00:20:55,779 --> 00:21:00,609
by x in 1234 echo x then it is a

517
00:21:00,609 --> 00:21:03,190
loop that is greater than by each

518
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:06,009
ele  I go to 1234 I am going to execute an echo

519
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:08,499
element, so this statement

520
00:21:08,499 --> 00:21:11,409
returns 1234 already because I am doing

521
00:21:11,409 --> 00:21:14,969
a loop of four iterations.

522
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,400


523
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,040


524
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,049


525
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:23,580
A

526
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,900
command also in a program in the

527
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,330
program can be taken, for example,

528
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:28,860
if we are working on

529
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,419
security issues and want to use that problem,

530
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:38,990
it can also be a command

531
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:42,510
but generally it differs, the

532
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,890
commands are those that perhaps come with

533
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,809
that operating state with the standard by

534
00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:49,620
Example he is that of the taster and so on and

535
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,970
the programs finally is my club

536
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,850
installing in a dirty indifference

537
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:55,860
of the truth to them that program

538
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,330
command nothing only with the same because

539
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,330
to make me write potholes

540
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,610
it does not matter it does not matter game solved

541
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:03,740
we know when  It can be with command line It

542
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,850
can also be

543
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:07,310
graphical interface for semester does not discriminate

544
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,440
on that by axis  mplo a program could

545
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,100
be one it could be that it could be a

546
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,780
program that I can rule this

547
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,130
can also be used for my writing

548
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,980
then

549
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,990
the commands that we will use are the ones

550
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,820
that will allow us to manipulate strings such

551
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,690
as double cut of each graph of a

552
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:29,180
series of the

553
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,850
cut programs will allow us to

554
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,830
make cuts, so to speak, string

555
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:38,540
that has characters,

556
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,350
we can, for example, if a

557
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:45,690
separator is not opened by toms, I

558
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:49,200
am going to tell the cut to vote for the

559
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,600
separation by commas, then what is it going to

560
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,580
do, it is going to divide the  string for every

561
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,760
year and more to come back and that I am going to

562
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,740
work on it obviously serves me to be able to

563
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,630
partially in your time information

564
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:03,030
where it leaves permission allows to process

565
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,670
text also allows to process a string

566
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:07,410
and allows to do many things has

567
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:09,420
bent a language with its

568
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,640
interpreted language as well  that refers to doing

569
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,440
many things here we go to the super

570
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,970
simple plan that is very similar to the

571
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,000
cult only that the result it

572
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,890
delivers  In the doublega you can work

573
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:20,750
better, it

574
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,110
is much more manipulable,

575
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,630
we will also

576
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,790
load a file

577
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:31,210
in the archive many times, but it really is to

578
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,970
concatenate files coupons cap file

579
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:36,840
one file two files three and

580
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,180
one only

581
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,490
and if we execute each file what you

582
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:42,720
were  Before concatenating a single file,

583
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,070
that is why the content was deactivated

584
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,500
and you are going to use it to perform

585
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,100
filters and searches within a street

586
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,970
we can use regular expressions

587
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:55,580
we can express make simple patterns

588
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,080
but finally what will allow us is to

589
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,050
search for a string for example if I have a

590
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,220
file that has many lines of

591
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,290
code not according to files and I want to find

592
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:06,170
some dates inside the envelopes of the

593
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,880
dates and a file that has

594
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,230
shown me on screen only what

595
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,760
matches that date

596
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,560
and that must be applied different

597
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,570
conditions such as court expressions

598
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,400
that begins to count characters that

599
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,110
never ends with such a character that

600
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:20,600
they have the character in between  ácter and to that

601
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,310
she a different game the subject of

602
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:24,800
regular expressions as the

603
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,720
example appears

604
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,910
I can echo my string separated

605
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:32,990
by spaces and f2 means that it

606
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:35,780
shows me the result number 2 and that the

607
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,720
separation is by spaces then it

608
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,880
will show me the  string word because if

609
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,740
you separated it by space and printed the

610
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,450
number 2 but after you show me

611
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,940
the word

612
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,799
the same exercise with twice the gas,

613
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:50,080
the result is the same only that

614
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,460
the syntax maybe a little more

615
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,980
complex and I tell you that with  the day is

616
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:57,460
capital that the space in my separator

617
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,230
so to speak and then I tell you what

618
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,000
to do with that extreme and I

619
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,350
say it that it shows me only stress

620
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,750
number 2 depending on the coincidence

621
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:07,179
and the separation that has been executed are

622
00:25:07,179 --> 00:25:09,330
two commands  different

623
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:12,789
to be able to execute the same thing, that is,

624
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:14,500
we have the same one with the same purpose

625
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,110
with two different commands and if they want to

626
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,580
make it easier we can make

627
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,500
it feel healthier more  It is complex for

628
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,480
example that before I do not print the

629
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,669
string you can work it by processing

630
00:25:24,669 --> 00:25:26,110
convert what is replace I accept the

631
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,639
value that it does by calculation and

632
00:25:27,639 --> 00:25:29,320
then they print it we can do double

633
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,649
from here we can generate little

634
00:25:31,649 --> 00:25:34,809
nóblega chiquititos that would be on

635
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:37,090
bach or hearts and

636
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:39,580
also  we are going to use kurt we are going to

637
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,730
use and abuse it because it

638
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:44,710
is super powerful it is already super super

639
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,110
powerful to execute it is key and to

640
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,850
present this at a general level because

641
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,140
the

642
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,970
headers can be completely manipulated, sessions must be saved

643
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:53,800
you can simulate a complete flow

644
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,440
to only  executing it happens I am going to

645
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,110
modify the variables you

646
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:00,940
can make a complete logic passing

647
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,000
through it

648
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,350
is super powerful and well everyone

649
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,580
knows they have both heard about cool

650
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,250
but in this case it will allow us to

651
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:11,300
connect to the website and then be

652
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:15,020
able to partially and work on its context

653
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:15,600
and

654
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,200
[Music]

655
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,090
some some people prefer to

656
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:22,420
use python for target

657
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:25,190
languages to be able to  make things

658
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,990
super simple I prefer to use

659
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,910
simply dark personally because

660
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,320
many times in football as I walk through

661
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,250
the advanced web of l we do I think and

662
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,140
then we put a by and add a

663
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,600
command we can have the result much

664
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,910
faster and much more  simple that I

665
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,950
did a write in python and invoke

666
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:45,530
345 libraries and that it ended up being

667
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:48,560
described as 8 lines or lines for

668
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,240
something that we can do in a line in

669
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,779
a pothole

670
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:55,059
I the person prefer to use a patch

671
00:26:55,059 --> 00:26:57,159
is used to perform the

672
00:26:57,159 --> 00:26:59,259
brute force they are  You can do

673
00:26:59,259 --> 00:27:01,269
sql injection you can choose this in an

674
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:03,580
automated way and this time we are going

675
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,330
to seem to you that

676
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:08,669
obviously scraping, which is what summons us in

677
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,529
this talk, is the technique used to

678
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:11,820
extract information in an

679
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:15,659
automated way from a website, the

680
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:17,820
truth is that  It can be a website in an

681
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,440
application of a file where in

682
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,029
this case it is to be used to extract

683
00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:23,039
information in an automated way instead

684
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,110
of s  Web sites that publish this

685
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:28,050
information that could be valuable, then

686
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,940
we are going to use bracho

687
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,960
scripting and they heal now and with that we are going to

688
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,730
headquarters on the way and there that is going to be our

689
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:37,760
proof of concept

690
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,460
we are going to use

691
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,320
two marketplaces that are well known

692
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,360
to use this is clear  and the idea is to be

693
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,210
able to demonstrate how easy the

694
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,070
commands that are executed are and give the

695
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,480
necessary recommendations so that this

696
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,280
can be

697
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,040
mitigated

698
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,360
then first before going to concept

699
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:03,830
a clause such as privacy why

700
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,990
today use the market place to

701
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:08,330
sell and to  buy not only

702
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:10,549
for people but the old is the people

703
00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:12,409
who want to sell they need to sell they

704
00:28:12,409 --> 00:28:14,330
have their SME they have their business their

705
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,100
entrepreneurship and they have to use these

706
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,440
markets it is that they exist it cannot be the

707
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:22,130
free market it can be now or it can be

708
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:24,740
the facebook market  any market text already

709
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,269
exists the truth there are even people who

710
00:28:26,269 --> 00:28:28,669
sell on instagram and the

711
00:28:28,669 --> 00:28:30,590
acquisition of each one is not bad and obviously

712
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,510
to be able to see  ender you have to pass

713
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:35,510
information because if you are going to sell something

714
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,519
you have to give another phone so that

715
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:39,380
they can contact you and there it is logical that you want to

716
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,760
sell something if it does not happen in your screen data it

717
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,050


718
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:42,890
arrives there where the problem is

719
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:45,170
then on the one hand there is the need

720
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:48,650
to be able to sell because this company

721
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,540
because your SME and you have to somehow be

722
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:53,300
able to sell it and on the other hand it said

723
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,530
to what extent I can leave the

724
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:55,940
information for example if you are

725
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,220
selling a car there are many people who

726
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,690
cover the patent for privacy issues

727
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:01,760
because any  A person can look for the

728
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,140
patent and see who it belongs to, where the

729
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,050
whole issue lives, then there are people who

730
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:08,030
will be there to hide information about the

731
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:10,040
car so that they can see how many

732
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,040
I am killing children or similar that there are other

733
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,060
people who do for

734
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,460
privacy issues then to  those people

735
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,730
clearly cost less to sell because it

736
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,900
costs more than people confess if you

737
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,730
see the publication of an ad that

738
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:24,650
gives you all the information he is  Tado in that it

739
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,960
is like this on a bicycle where is the

740
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,460
location if the bicycle is there we

741
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,010
are the avatar the serenade puntarenas

742
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,390
that gives me added value

743
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:35,750
because it is not going to see something and it was

744
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,460
located in santiago has not bought

745
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,650
visible that they were puntarenas

746
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:42,040
but it is important to

747
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,330
know that this directly affects

748
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:46,040
privacy but ultimately it ends up

749
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,720
being the decision of each one, that is,

750
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,910
when I publish an ad I make the

751
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:51,380
decision to publish my new phone,

752
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:54,080
it is not a problem to say that the

753
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,910
amd platform is that the platform

754
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:58,130
unintentionally exposes  my phone the

755
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,230
problem that exists is that the

756
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:03,230
platforms should be prepared to

757
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,970
prevent scrabble so on a

758
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,280
platform I have a marketplace that

759
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,690
I am going to tell users to put

760
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,670
their information to put their

761
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,770
phone number their address their name put

762
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:14,840
everything myself  I have to take care of it and

763
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,180
prevent there is a third party

764
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,100
who can completely create the

765
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,840
sakhalin site  forms of all

766
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,230
and that what I want to get to is to say that

767
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,670
the responsibility that exists to

768
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:28,310
prevent them goes beyond the

769
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,190
sensitive information that is published

770
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:32,880
so

771
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,600
we are going to make this concept which is the

772
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,280
extraction of public information because,

773
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,650
as I mentioned to you, it is information that the

774
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:42,780
The same people the same person decided to

775
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,750
publish now and in this case the

776
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,640
platforms if you want they are not

777
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,250
preventing you, it is key, however we

778
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,810
are not going to use any type of bypass

779
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:54,900
, it is no longer in my relationship of

780
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,000
privileges we are going to have it well

781
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,650
nothing simply with  The things that are

782
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,240
public can even be with

783
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,190
information that the search engines

784
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:05,310
index and at no time we are going to

785
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,500
seek to attack the host to the company or the

786
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,810
website it is not the purpose the

787
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,880
purpose is to collect information

788
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,560
simply for an educational use

789
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,250
obviously and only  it is key it is not our

790
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,710
new not the cyberattack simply a

791
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:23,340
slave obviously the purpose for

792
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,900
which it executes bad streaming  it will

793
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,260
determine if

794
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,450
there is any abuse or something like

795
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:32,250
that since it can be finally it is simply

796
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,500
demonstrative

797
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:37,050
so in this demonstration we are going to

798
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:40,050
use a little program per command

799
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:42,630
line called geo, knowledge is required

800
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:45,050
from an image and it will allow us to

801
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:47,910
extract the text from an image  For example, if

802
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:50,010
you take a photo of a vehicle, the

803
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:52,680
second photo is its patent and the photo is of such

804
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,510
good quality and it is read and it is the patent,

805
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,940
execute this command and it returns the

806
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,460
plain text in the patent, we are going to

807
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,440
convert that it is to convert the

808
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,600
images that are more legible because

809
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,220
after the game is worked with

810
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,500
images that you have strategy and in a

811
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,600
specific quality to ensure that

812
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,460
the image is read well then with converse

813
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,530
we are going to take our image and we are going

814
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:15,390
to convert it to the expected format in this

815
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,680
case  the format but today we do with the

816
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,030
pgr is the proposal of images

817
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,560
then with the convair we are going to adjust

818
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,900
the slow image and we are going to use it with

819
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,140
greg cap echo it seems our  or write and

820
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:31,310
automate this process

821
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,860
we are going to do the demonstration then

822
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:36,789
masters of the screen

823
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:53,750
the example that we are going to see is with this

824
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,520
marketplace

825
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,240
how good I think they no longer know them

826
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,680
and do not combine any region for

827
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,680
example maule and began to see the

828
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:08,030
ads  If you do not see the ads and we are going

829
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:10,160
to select one, for example we are going to

830
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,419
select a

831
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:16,940
perfect field guard court,

832
00:33:17,059 --> 00:33:19,429
the police then one despite the

833
00:33:19,429 --> 00:33:21,710
ad and if you are not interested and the

834
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,720
right side appears

835
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,530
it is not coming out

836
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:39,259
so

837
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,150
we are going depending on the demand

838
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:44,760
we simply enter the site

839
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,550
main we are here

840
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:49,280
[Music]

841
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,930
I am not afraid of any weaving this case

842
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,820
has already selected the maule and previewed an

843
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,770
announcement that made fat country pig

844
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:57,129
that is here

845
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:59,870
and now see the nuncio I am interested in the announcement

846
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,610
and it turns out that he wants the right coast,

847
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:06,140
the information appears already  can show

848
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:09,500
and offers the phone book appears the

849
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:13,460
name appears from where is the

850
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,980
phone number the new phone what for

851
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,659
some reason n  Or did you look for it, I imagine that

852
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:20,090
to protect perhaps what

853
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:22,520
the data weave is free, however, in names

854
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,530
if I am going to copy it and the selection

855
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:27,199
also and indeed if I

856
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,030
right click and put that it opens the image

857
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,219
in a note, it

858
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:34,580
is an image effectively  Then

859
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,550
what are we going to do in this proof of

860
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:40,989
concept we are going to try is to create

861
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:46,879
this portal and extract the 30 2 from us

862
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,129
and then obviously the script I already

863
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:51,349
have it armed so that the proof of

864
00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:53,960
concepts functions the script what it

865
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,690
does is

866
00:34:55,690 --> 00:35:00,140
it gets into this  url for example and

867
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,690
start browsing a super ad

868
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:04,549
announced an ad ad brings

869
00:35:04,549 --> 00:35:07,220
4 ads and for each ad that exists it

870
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,500
will extract

871
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,040
the personal information name

872
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,740
where the person lives and also the

873
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,480
phone number and phone number

874
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,400
thank you that  we are going to transform text

875
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,780
then that after we can put it in

876
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,250
a database how to do what is

877
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:25,220
adapted then as I mentioned this

878
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,750
public information if you want to meter

879
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,490
a  day finds are put into any

880
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:31,160
advertisement and this system can show the phone number,

881
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,740
this surplus

882
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,290
sensitive information or put your private ones,

883
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:37,510
we are simply

884
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,440
taking advantage of the fact that they do not have

885
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,990
key techniques before, why because

886
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,730
they have the phone number status

887
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:45,680
as an image does not necessarily mean

888
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,750
that they are technical  Before for free, the

889
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,070
truth is that we are not skipping anything

890
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,120
so

891
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:55,569
I had the script prepared

892
00:35:55,569 --> 00:35:58,440
that I am going to show

893
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:11,220
it to you I do not know if you are tired

894
00:36:16,369 --> 00:36:19,960
the writing that you do is first

895
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,609
we pass the web to you in this case

896
00:36:22,609 --> 00:36:24,380
of passing a loft that is the

897
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:28,069
ejido  metropolitan and we are going to make a

898
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:29,809
serious at 6

899
00:36:29,809 --> 00:36:33,509
because here we are looking at the html

900
00:36:33,509 --> 00:36:35,819
so that they give us information that

901
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:37,890
we need,

902
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:39,690
we need, for

903
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:42,600
example, the hurdes, that is, the script what

904
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,780
they do is called the

905
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,830
metropolitan selection point

906
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,160
and what

907
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:56,710
was being done was  simulated American

908
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:59,450
this page is issued the script

909
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:03,530
and searched for a match of re  d and that

910
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:07,690
it is called differently then

911
00:37:10,309 --> 00:37:11,989
this is what you are looking for through the

912
00:37:11,989 --> 00:37:15,589
script and why are you looking for this because

913
00:37:15,589 --> 00:37:17,779
in each of these elements there is an

914
00:37:17,779 --> 00:37:19,999
idea that the idea does not work and there is a

915
00:37:19,999 --> 00:37:24,630
link that is the link to the ad

916
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:28,630
then for  Each element that we see here

917
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:31,690
is an element that takes us

918
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:34,600
to the ad itself and then what we

919
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,700
do in the script for each ad

920
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,490
that exists,

921
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:41,980
I connect to that link and extract the

922
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:44,050
personal information and personal information

923
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,270
as it is in the image.  What

924
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:49,390
do I do? First, I convert it to the

925
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:52,000
image format that I can read. It wants jpg and

926
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,950
then

927
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:56,050
we choose the command game sl to

928
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,660
transform it into text

929
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:02,290
then in an almost magical way and execute

930
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:04,860
the script

931
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,930
we have been seeing how the

932
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:09,550
information of all the ads that

933
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,170
are in  you call

934
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:13,960
when it shows that it does not have a binary match it

935
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,470
may be because of the characters

936
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:19,750
already because it is missing maybe they were a

937
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,369
cheerful command already so that it can read

938
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:23,800
those files without problems  But as you can

939
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,200
see, the cell phone is bringing information

940
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,240
in the form of text, because I'm

941
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,670
crazy, it has taken me off

942
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,690
and this can obviously be left

943
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:34,910
running overnight all day, the

944
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,740
problem is

945
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:40,250
not there, now we execute about 50

946
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:42,200
requests and there is no type of

947
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,660
Blocking, that is, this can be done, it

948
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:49,970
is a risk that exists when you

949
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:52,160
publish personal information to be able to

950
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,020
sell, perhaps it has been published,

951
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,940
mobile phone, perhaps it will never sell,

952
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,230
especially if you are a company or if

953
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:59,840
you sell things but this shows the

954
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,369
risk that  It exists in data management

955
00:39:01,369 --> 00:39:03,410
that is to say that scraping is not prevented in

956
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:07,130
this sense another example

957
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:08,470
is

958
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,700
that we also not only see it

959
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,629
regularly

960
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:19,880
for example chile cars we will look for

961
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,810
any model example

962
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:25,950
look for one

963
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:28,879
but letter

964
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,520
and the same when you enter a

965
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,960
vehicle for example  It is

966
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,700
of the vehicle information and a

967
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,500
button on the right side I wanted to call the

968
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,320
seller to put a phone number and with this

969
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,880
you can contact him  mediator makes

970
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,460
the corresponding route if the person

971
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,750
who publishes the ad does not put his

972
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,780
phone is much more complicated to sell

973
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:53,040
then what are we going to do we are

974
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,470
going to take advantage of that and we are going to do the

975
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:57,030
same type of writing we are going to create

976
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:59,400
this portal and we are going to transform this

977
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,160
text that  It is an image you can see in

978
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,400
a photo we are also going to

979
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,970


980
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:10,430
transform it into the text of yesterday in

981
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:11,600
some way unfortunately

982
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,120
then I am going to

983
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,220
update this

984
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:19,450
on the inspection of the element

985
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:22,570
we are going to see because I like a

986
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:24,730
detail when you press

987
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:28,840
the phone button the platform will look for

988
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,640
the phone somewhere and shows it

989
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,580
as a good time click the

990
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,190
requests

991
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,990
to me the request that interests me is I

992
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:40,100
wanted to contact you hungry

993
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:44,500
we already bought more dance measurements

994
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,160
ey

995
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,500


996
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,230
what  returns this request is a

997
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:55,470
content the html with a string

998
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:59,160
based on 64 that signer this you go to 64 is

999
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,460
the image in the image with the number

1000
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,440
then what  e we have to do we

1001
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,630
have to make a script that can

1002
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,240
read the information that

1003
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:13,759
this request returns and transforms it into text.In

1004
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,020
this case,

1005
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:20,030
what we have to do is take that

1006
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:22,010
pass 64 partially or perfectly

1007
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:24,020
transform it into binary, and

1008
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:27,260
save it in a file that  have the form

1009
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:29,510
of an image so to speak and we are going to

1010
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:31,099
convert it to better even though our

1011
00:41:31,099 --> 00:41:33,980
command I will be it can be and that is what

1012
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,119
I have also prepared

1013
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,830
is the command

1014
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,120
then to the command I give an

1015
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,970
argument so to speak the url to

1016
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:54,770
which I want to obtain this information

1017
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:57,740
in this case is

1018
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:00,050
pg bhutto cat

1019
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:02,700
to be able to read the action and dowry of

1020
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,890
delivering and I am going to make a gram and I am going

1021
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:06,450
to make a gram of everything I say you are going

1022
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:08,900
to 64 points this disk

1023
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,790
and I am going to  ask greece to show me

1024
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:12,110
only what is within that

1025
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:14,799
match for example

1026
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:18,609
if I make a base 64 group trico it will not

1027
00:42:18,609 --> 00:42:20,979
be more with this and it will show me from now

1028
00:42:20,979 --> 00:42:23,920
on then only the

1029
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,509
bas  e 64

1030
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:28,089
the base 64 I am going to save it in a

1031
00:42:28,089 --> 00:42:29,079
file

1032
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,849
and that file later I am going to convert it

1033
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:33,910
into a readable jpg by my cr command and

1034
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:35,949
finally the command I will be the data

1035
00:42:35,949 --> 00:42:38,289
of that file and it will show

1036
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:40,349
the

1037
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:44,039
clear text on the screen the  phone number and

1038
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:46,839
then what we have to do in this

1039
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:48,849
case it is prepared for them to read

1040
00:42:48,849 --> 00:42:51,249
burger we are going to right click

1041
00:42:51,249 --> 00:42:54,660
on contact see

1042
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:02,530
we are going to copy cool as bach

1043
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:04,510
that easy it is great you even

1044
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:06,010
catch an expert of guilt which creates  The

1045
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:09,940
sentence and he pasted it imputed me and when

1046
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,680
I execute it I see the same thing as the

1047
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,850
developer element I paste

1048
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:18,539
the base 64 string then my script

1049
00:43:18,539 --> 00:43:21,150
will take that 64, decode it,

1050
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:23,640
transform it into a jpg file and it will

1051
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,960
read it with the I

1052
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,950
am then I go  to use the sentence pipe and sh

1053
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:34,300
chile cars to greece and with the sentence

1054
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,550
I take the result of the first fight

1055
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:38,810
forming the second, that is, the

1056
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:40,520
result of the command poor what we

1057
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,620
are seeing here will serve as

1058
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,690
inputs for this  The script that we

1059
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:46,460
generate, then, when I execute

1060
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,740
this command, it should

1061
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:51,680
result in the phone number in plain text

1062
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,270


1063
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:55,220
and indeed here are listeners, we have

1064
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:56,630
to work on these errors so that

1065
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:58,820
the script is cleaner but here

1066
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,080
we have the text, that is, the phone number in

1067
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:05,390
text.  plane 9 800 65 83 21 and if

1068
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:08,170
we are not going to advertisements

1069
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:13,140
in the file or that is the same number already

1070
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:16,530
then we transform our image

1071
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:17,930
into

1072
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:20,670
the string and this same we can start

1073
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:23,040
scanning the same as in the other portal and

1074
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,330
the malón has emptied with the name the

1075
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:26,310
person with the location perhaps with the

1076
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:27,870
vehicle even that sells and with the

1077
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:29,640
phone number and this form can be

1078
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,430
the three information is that

1079
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:35,070
both marketplaces had published a

1080
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:37,530
new phone and because of my image

1081
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:38,790
however that was not enough to

1082
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:40,560
prevent them from cam and then  Obviously

1083
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,750
now come the recommendations that

1084
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,670
we comment on to be able to mitigate

1085
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:46,410
this type of thing, which is the best

1086
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:48,960
practice and for that  We are going to return to the

1087
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,470
presentation

1088
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:58,220
and we are going to see the mitigation part,

1089
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:01,160
the input mechanism, that is, there are

1090
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,500
many techniques to mitigate

1091
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,180
screaming but there are also many

1092
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:07,160
ways to skip them, so it

1093
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,200
may be that you put the text number

1094
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,880
as the number  As an

1095
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,680
image, it may be an anti-mechanism, it

1096
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,990
is serious, but there are five hundred

1097
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:18,550
ways you can skip that, and then it

1098
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:21,290
is important to know that there are many

1099
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:24,820
ways to skip this type of thing.

1100
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:27,620
The first recommendation and one of the

1101
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:30,840
most effective is to use a captcha.

1102
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,730
We cannot put a transition captcha

1103
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,590
because it would affect the performance because

1104
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:36,300
for each captcha for each request

1105
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,920
who wants together that in

1106
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,410
captcha the platform has to go to

1107
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:42,120
validate with that captcha that they touch is

1108
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,920
correct then imagine you

1109
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,770
are seeing the platform browsing they are

1110
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:48,270
browsing  one hour the platform of the

1111
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:49,950
operating vehicle they want to buy

1112
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:51,750
and for each of their requests s  and

1113
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:54,450
send a capture request that

1114
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:57,120
directly affects performance because it may

1115
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,070
be that it really is much more in

1116
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:01,110
responding to the indication of a whole

1117
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:05,610
wants and then the recommendation is to be

1118
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:08,670
able to identify the

1119
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:10,770
platform structure functionality that exposes certain

1120
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:14,010
type of information and information as a

1121
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:15,900
number  phone number such as address or

1122
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:18,120
personal data then

1123
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,100
my platform has a functionality

1124
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,590
that could be exploited or could be

1125
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:25,380
vulnerable if that functionality of

1126
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:26,600
opening a captcha for example on

1127
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,590
Halloween is always put captcha

1128
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:30,540
to avoid brute force attacks for

1129
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,690
example

1130
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:35,820
if they already have  chile auto would have had

1131
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:37,110
a captcha

1132
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:39,270
in this implementation, the script would not

1133
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:40,230
have worked it

1134
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:43,230
simply would not have worked since

1135
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:45,200
another technique that is using

1136
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,290
images to display text

1137
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:51,090
and the purpose of that image for

1138
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:52,650
our text is that they cannot make

1139
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:54,600
writing, we have to put noise to  the

1140
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,280
image is to tell people that they

1141
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,830
are  This is clearly distorted, which means that my

1142
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:01,140
recognition program is not able

1143
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:04,020
to read it and that is exactly what

1144
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:06,420
the captors do, how they have to complete

1145
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,980
a captcha and the text appears a

1146
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,570
little messy with some lines

1147
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:12,090
crossed and with a background that they

1148
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:13,200
sometimes do.  That the coffee better

1149
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,630
understand that they are generating noise in the

1150
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:17,130
image so that it cannot be read in

1151
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:18,840
an automated way

1152
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:22,080
then this is exactly the same if

1153
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,700
we would not only make noise to that image

1154
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,680
we achieve a strange background some lines

1155
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,130
through our cdr it will not work

1156
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:31,080
then for  On one hand, we are not

1157
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,880
foreseeing the keys because the person

1158
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,869
can do it is clear but he will not be able to

1159
00:47:34,869 --> 00:47:36,910
read the information, he will not be able to read

1160
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:38,980
the data, he will not be able to read, for example,

1161
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,839
the telephone number

1162
00:47:40,839 --> 00:47:43,690
and that is important

1163
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:46,720
finally and implements

1164
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,670
monitoring mechanisms  in alert mechanisms as

1165
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:50,349
well and obviously

1166
00:47:50,349 --> 00:47:53,440
blocking mechanisms that is, if I have a

1167
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,050
malicious user who is delivering it to me, it is

1168
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:57,280
sending many requests because it is

1169
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,810
being written because it is setting up a

1170
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:01,119
database later for that I have

1171
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:02,470
to be aware of that there has to

1172
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:04,180
be some monitoring something that mahler and

1173
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:06,130
tell me I am going to know that there is a user

1174
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:07,980
who

1175
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:11,109
is all over the site in  Less than a minute

1176
00:48:11,109 --> 00:48:13,329
is really key because a person is

1177
00:48:13,329 --> 00:48:16,410
not going to enter all the tabs

1178
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:20,920
ads and the scraping behavior

1179
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,839
when a program is creating that

1180
00:48:22,839 --> 00:48:26,700
can be detected

1181
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:30,130
blocking

1182
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:33,609
maybe for a few minutes now or maybe

1183
00:48:33,609 --> 00:48:37,348
they did not detect suspicious behavior

1184
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:41,500
if  solves that captcha by

1185
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,690
browsing then in that way

1186
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:45,400
it prevents a person from exploring a similar bot

1187
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:49,810
and then obviously the recommendation

1188
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:51,670
will always be looking at what

1189
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:53,170
our platform is associating, especially

1190
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:54,690
if our platform

1191
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:56,980
works and processes

1192
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:58,390
personal data information we have to give a

1193
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:01,440
responsible training on  that information

1194
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:04,550
here the time was gathered so thank you very

1195
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:07,930
much yes to the pre  siting

1196
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:10,460
but that it has been

1197
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:12,619
expeditious I hope you also decided a

1198
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:15,180
little didactic for

1199
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:17,190
good it complicated all the expectation is

1200
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:19,230
expeditious it has been didactic it has been

1201
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:21,690
surprising it has been disturbing to know

1202
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:24,180
that the data exposed precisely already in

1203
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:25,440
Chile- auto in any those places

1204
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,240
are available for scraping  with

1205
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,210
which it is terrible it

1206
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:31,550
has been quite revealing of boesch and

1207
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:32,750
fernando we have some questions for you

1208
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:33,860
and I hope you can share a few

1209
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:37,030
minutes with us so that you can answer it

1210
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:39,770
blanch they say when we should

1211
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:41,780
stop thinking about usability x and

1212
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:44,400
prioritize security

1213
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,099
a long time ago  What has happened that are

1214
00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:48,500
things that perhaps I do

1215
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:53,000
not know are I do not know if they are incompatible

1216
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,599
I already learned the usability of a system, it

1217
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:00,480
can not be above

1218
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,490
safety and that is the work that has

1219
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:04,319
to be together for example the

1220
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,119
typical example  the typical problem

1221
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:09,569
is that there are many companies that

1222
00:50:09,569 --> 00:50:11,700
initially refused to put a captcha and

1223
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:13,680
one di  What is the probability that it

1224
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,000
is not the site if there are not people who

1225
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,289
may not be able to over the captcha

1226
00:50:16,289 --> 00:50:18,630
because it is ugly because what is beautiful is going to be

1227
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:21,119
a large in super beautiful and it

1228
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:23,369
turns out that the captcha then one says

1229
00:50:23,369 --> 00:50:24,599
but that the  Security is

1230
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:26,789
asking for it then it has security versus

1231
00:50:26,789 --> 00:50:29,549
there were indeed ways to

1232
00:50:29,549 --> 00:50:31,740
do it, for example that the captcha

1233
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:34,710
shows it to you on the third attempt, that is, you

1234
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:36,960
are not hitting the usability because the

1235
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,359
number of people who make a mistake two

1236
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:42,059
or three times in their password is  little

1237
00:50:42,059 --> 00:50:44,910
then 90% people earned their

1238
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:46,740
first credential with their first key

1239
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:48,450
the first attempt

1240
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:52,710
and this 5% are wrong and maybe 5%

1241
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:55,200
are wrong sometimes so if

1242
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,880
you tell a captcha only to those

1243
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,500
people

1244
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,990
we are giving them  the captcha maybe 5

1245
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:02,370
% people and is writing an

1246
00:51:02,370 --> 00:51:05,910
attack the same with this topic deja vú de

1247
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:08,400
chile autos you can show a captcha on

1248
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,020
the third attempt to say when you see that

1249
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:12,450
there is a behavior  I suspect that the

1250
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:14,070
person is putting too many

1251
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:16,170
requests for samples in captcha and watches

1252
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:18,210
characters in the captcha that continue

1253
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:20,250
browsing and I nowadays there are

1254
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:22,940
captcha mechanisms that allow

1255
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:24,960
monitoring the behavior of the

1256
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,940
user such as the famous google captcha

1257
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:28,830
that is the invisible captcha that  It does not

1258
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:30,510
cost you a challenge unless you really

1259
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:32,160
cannot determine you want a vote

1260
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,460
then that is the little eye that appears in

1261
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,790
the lower right corner

1262
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:39,870
that says that the site is

1263
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:41,430
protected by the captcha it is an

1264
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:43,680
invisible caps and that captcha does not

1265
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,720
show the  user the challenge but

1266
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,970
he himself determines a scoring and the

1267
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:49,950
sporting beat the Serbian so that

1268
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:52,650
a button is perfectly visible,

1269
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:55,290
so today there are many

1270
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:57,210
mechanisms so that usability is

1271
00:51:57,210 --> 00:51:59,770
compatible with security

1272
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:02,570
another example is when we have a login

1273
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:06,080
and the  platform site you make a mistake in the

1274
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,569
user

1275
00:52:07,569 --> 00:52:09,729
the platform says users correct if

1276
00:52:09,729 --> 00:52:11,380
you make a mistake the password the platform

1277
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:14,019
says wrong password then when the

1278
00:52:14,019 --> 00:52:15,849
user when the platform tells you that

1279
00:52:15,849 --> 00:52:17,529
the password is wrong you assume that the

1280
00:52:17,529 --> 00:52:19,839
user also then the attacker

1281
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,579
can do user numbering and

1282
00:52:21,579 --> 00:52:23,440
can have a list of 15,000 users

1283
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,719
and based on the response delivered by the

1284
00:52:25,719 --> 00:52:27,940
server you  you can determine who are

1285
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:30,670
users and who are not users a

1286
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:32,559
mitigation for that is that the message of

1287
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:34,509
the generic a that says credentials

1288
00:52:34,509 --> 00:52:36,549
invades at no time again and if

1289
00:52:36,549 --> 00:52:37,959
the user is valid with the key and

1290
00:52:37,959 --> 00:52:40,180
malia and there also has a topic knew

1291
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:41,799
why  the more information or the

1292
00:52:41,799 --> 00:52:43,359
more time they leave the

1293
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:46,719
user about their error about what is

1294
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:48,339
being wrong, much more feasible

1295
00:52:48,339 --> 00:52:49,359
that the person I hope can navigate

1296
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:51,160
time then if we have

1297
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,529
generic messages the use of times but who

1298
00:52:53,529 --> 00:52:56,109
told me that the key in the  user

1299
00:52:56,109 --> 00:52:57,400
and there also where the dispute between

1300
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,859
security versus usability begins and then it

1301
00:52:59,859 --> 00:53:02,170
is necessary to put the balance what are the

1302
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:03,789
risks the v  Going the

1303
00:53:03,789 --> 00:53:05,440
cruel benefits with three and based on that making

1304
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,290
decisions, for example, it may be you want

1305
00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:10,810
because in a registration process you are in

1306
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:12,700
a process that a new product is being turned on

1307
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:14,770
and a marketing campaign is being carried out

1308
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:16,540
and it had client letters purposes

1309
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:17,650


1310
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:19,270
perhaps  If you put a captcha on it, it

1311
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:20,890
will attract much less clients so

1312
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:23,350
perhaps under that scenario it puts it in the

1313
00:53:23,350 --> 00:53:25,840
balance short profit and I do not in any

1314
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,810
way assume it and the links without captcha

1315
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:30,670
but somehow it has to have

1316
00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:32,140
as a compensatory control that is to say

1317
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:34,540
if you  He is going to launch it without captcha, he has

1318
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:36,220
to be monitoring because if someone

1319
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:38,230
manages to abuse that tour functionality

1320
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:40,660
, it is that it blocks already then to

1321
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:43,420
inform compensatory there are mitigation measures there is

1322
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,450
not

1323
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:47,860
necessarily a single solution so if

1324
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:49,930
you had to make its development compatible

1325
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:51,490
with your design with an ability  The only

1326
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:53,230
compensatory measure application but you have

1327
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,210
to apply them because if your site is not going to be

1328
00:53:55,210 --> 00:53:57,340
very beautiful but it must  jo they

1329
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:01,580
are doing it see that comment

1330
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:03,920
that you have in helmand and ask where you

1331
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,950
can download the

1332
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:09,680
public script but I do not play but for that

1333
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,180
we are going to your network at the end whoever wants to

1334
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:14,060
talk to you can now generate

1335
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:16,040
scrap at the database level and  If

1336
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,050
possible, how could it be mitigated,

1337
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:20,830
Alberto asks if

1338
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:23,840
scrap can be generated at the database level

1339
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:27,020
and if possible how it could be

1340
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:28,030
mitigated

1341
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:32,030
is that the base returns a value

1342
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:34,280
that value does not show the web server

1343
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,470
finally what it is creating for us  is

1344
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:38,450
what the web shows you if you got the

1345
00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:39,920
information from the database,

1346
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,540
you got it from an api or this is an

1347
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:43,310
indifferent file because I have what

1348
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:46,370
I am, write something on a website,

1349
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:48,470
not where that information comes from,

1350
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:50,240
then give  I therefore write

1351
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,040
too much because doing in writing that

1352
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,470
is claimed has been given but in this

1353
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:56,450
sense it has no relationship why

1354
00:54:56,450 --> 00:54:57,790


1355
00:54:57,790 --> 00:54:59,470
I do not have direct access to the

1356
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:01,120
base to two for example of chill-out or  If

1357
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,400
you do not count those data through the

1358
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,920
web page, I am writing to

1359
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,990
the web page at night, literally, it is

1360
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:10,030
like passing the how the knife will pass

1361
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:11,350
over the cake and grab everything that

1362
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:15,520
I have left over above as to how that

1363
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,410
same

1364
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:19,390
perfect hears to violate  six questions

1365
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:21,220
can be detected when an ip is

1366
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:23,590
making scappini block it currently

1367
00:55:23,590 --> 00:55:25,210
many are dynamic how long

1368
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:26,740
would it take how long is it recommended to

1369
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,720
apply this type of block before

1370
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,820
the ip arrives again to avoid

1371
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:32,950
losing a valid user who used that ip

1372
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:34,370
after

1373
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:36,260
the times although  they are dynamic they do not

1374
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:39,770
change a friend changes every 12 minutes

1375
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:41,030
hours

1376
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:44,030
if she is on a mobile phone and you are

1377
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:45,560
walking down the street and you change

1378
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,120
during the other one she probably tells her to

1379
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,220
change but that they are dynamic does not

1380
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:50,690
mean that for each request she will

1381
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:52,400
change unless she is  using for

1382
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,380
example by your visit to use your

1383
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:56,750
scriptor and fine theory was what it does

1384
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:59,030
that because the blessing causes  An author

1385
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:01,550
and then it has been left then can

1386
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:03,110
send that in my requests using toro

1387
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:04,910
and fire and the 10,000 requests go and with a

1388
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:06,800
different IP the problem that I am going to make

1389
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,230
you slow and in that electronic sense

1390
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:11,180
because it does not make much sense because

1391
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:12,890
it takes 20  or 30 seconds for each

1392
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:15,230
request, who will get 10 thousand users, it will

1393
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:17,540
take you a month to do it,

1394
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:20,570
then the recommendation on how to

1395
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:23,589
block or how to identify an IP,

1396
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:25,329
the recommendations can also see the

1397
00:56:25,329 --> 00:56:27,519
history that the

1398
00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:30,359
platform has in this case because if it

1399
00:56:30,359 --> 00:56:33,829
is, for example  In a university,

1400
00:56:33,829 --> 00:56:36,140
now it is not in your work in your

1401
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:38,749
company all the officials or all

1402
00:56:38,749 --> 00:56:40,339
the students leave through the same address

1403
00:56:40,339 --> 00:56:42,709
and see what exists in blocking the

1404
00:56:42,709 --> 00:56:43,910
entire institution and all the users,

1405
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:47,359
so you have to apply something that is a

1406
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,829
little further  from Felipe himself, which

1407
00:56:48,829 --> 00:56:50,660
is to block the behavior and

1408
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:53,959
perhaps block that session or that IP address

1409
00:56:53,959 --> 00:56:56,539
based on perhaps it is not his reputation already

1410
00:56:56,539 --> 00:56:58,849
but I in day  to the blocking as

1411
00:56:58,849 --> 00:57:01,039
arbitrary IP address that is not highly

1412
00:57:01,039 --> 00:57:02,509
recommended unless you have a good

1413
00:57:02,509 --> 00:57:04,430
basis that you know that that IP address

1414
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:07,640
is from someone's house, it may not

1415
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:10,489
be from a mobile internet but not from an

1416
00:57:10,489 --> 00:57:11,930
institution so that is also

1417
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:14,779
It can be done based on reputation and the

1418
00:57:14,779 --> 00:57:16,999
importance of how often it blocks if

1419
00:57:16,999 --> 00:57:18,410
every five or ten requests it stops

1420
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:19,969
selling because constantly on a

1421
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:21,460
web

1422
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:24,220
page the web page generates 10,000 requests

1423
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:26,440
you enter and the web page that I

1424
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,210
imagined bousquet resource that avastin

1425
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:31,300
css resource connects with another garden

1426
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:33,970
where the browser for each visit that

1427
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:36,910
you browse will execute 2025

1428
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:39,430
connections more or less and if you have your

1429
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:41,770
threshold configured 10 connections per

1430
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:43,690
second it will achieve it because a

1431
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:45,130
normal behavior what must be

1432
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:46,710
blocked here  It is the behavior,

1433
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:48,570
for example, when you do not have a

1434
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:51,099
history of that user, that is,

1435
00:57:51,099 --> 00:57:52,810
at the direct request of this resource, for

1436
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:57,040
example, our de chile autos I will

1437
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,079
I have gone through the ad

1438
00:57:59,079 --> 00:58:01,450
not even the fact and not even the

1439
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:03,729
ad I passed the url of the image

1440
00:58:03,729 --> 00:58:06,549
of the phone number so a user

1441
00:58:06,549 --> 00:58:08,410
cannot reach that image if they did not

1442
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:10,719
enter the ad before then one can go

1443
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:12,489
the value of the behavior that is,

1444
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,829
you can  Even generating sessions, the

1445
00:58:14,829 --> 00:58:16,719
user first enters the

1446
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:19,089
profile ad and the image and that I combo

1447
00:58:19,089 --> 00:58:21,329
with a session and that session

1448
00:58:21,329 --> 00:58:24,400
can be, for example, it is not a shipment,

1449
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,079
what not, and then when he

1450
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:27,849
wants to access the image he has  the

1451
00:58:27,849 --> 00:58:29,970
phone number

1452
00:58:29,970 --> 00:58:32,140
that the session has been created

1453
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:34,089
previously and then there are different

1454
00:58:34,089 --> 00:58:35,289
mechanisms that exist to

1455
00:58:35,289 --> 00:58:38,920
prevent writing if there is a lot

1456
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,599
of information about there are many techniques to be

1457
00:58:40,599 --> 00:58:42,069
able to do it and there are also many

1458
00:58:42,069 --> 00:58:43,749
techniques that can give you 'false

1459
00:58:43,749 --> 00:58:44,920
positives'

1460
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,359
that is why it is important  analyze each

1461
00:58:46,359 --> 00:58:47,920
platform that is, I have a

1462
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,660
payment platform, for example, I have

1463
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:50,950
a login platform, I have a

1464
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:52,869
platform that exposes information.

1465
00:58:52,869 --> 00:58:54,670
Personal ón and that has to do case by

1466
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:56,529
case how to mitigate that is that

1467
00:58:56,529 --> 00:58:58,329
also in particular

1468
00:58:58,329 --> 00:58:59,619
but the captcha always in the best

1469
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:01,839
measure

1470
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:03,999
perfect fernando hey how we arrive

1471
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:05,559
now lunch there are many people connected

1472
00:59:05,559 --> 00:59:06,849
there are many questions but

1473
00:59:06,849 --> 00:59:07,930
unfortunately I have to give way

1474
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:10,210
quickly

1475
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:11,710
Eduardo's presentation about cats ni

1476
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:13,960
fer is also coming to us, I also hope that you are attentive to

1477
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,190
listen to that, we

1478
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:16,839
hear in the little ones, quite

1479
00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:19,089
interesting fernando, I want to thank

1480
00:59:19,089 --> 00:59:22,779
the time for the provision of your presentation,

1481
00:59:22,779 --> 00:59:25,599
the demo that particularly brought

1482
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:29,559
quite a surprise within the users

1483
00:59:29,559 --> 00:59:31,509
of  our conference today

1484
00:59:31,509 --> 00:59:33,910
and I can not thank you a million and

1485
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:36,339
let you say that we can hardly return

1486
