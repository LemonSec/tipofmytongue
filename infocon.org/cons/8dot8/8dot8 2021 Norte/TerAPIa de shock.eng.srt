and we are back

4
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:22,990

access through our

8
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,160
peace links like if they want to find the link they

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,370
can do it through www 828  dot

10
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,260
org there you will find the link to

11
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,000
write spam line if you participate with

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,500
your company email you will be able to

13
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,620
participate for eye prizes so that we can

14
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,150
raise information and besides that you

15
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,400
will be able to access this transmission and

16
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,050
also the chat where we are also

17
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,239
giving away tempos books  Anyway, everything is

18
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:50,800
happening at the moment from here

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,989
until three or four in the afternoon because

20
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:55,059
we have much much more to talk about

21
00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:56,980
cybersecurity this is one of the many

22
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,210
events that we have held during the

23
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,620
year where we have had a very special

24
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,980
agenda to be able to be close  of you

25
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,179

synchronously and asynchronously because you

27
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,110

successful spending today we are going to talk about

41
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:43,030
apis and we are going to talk about solutions and

42
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,890
security about apis I am going to leave the

43
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,840
space for you to continue

44
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,230
presenting this is all the how to

45
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,090
say it  the virtual stage of 8.8

46
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,909
regional north is for you, go ahead,

47
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:58,399
thank you very much doctor, good afternoon

48
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,310
to all, it is a pleasure to be here again

49
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,280
at 8.8 event in which I had the

50
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,350
privilege of presenting in its 2015 version

51
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,449
on security in mobile

52
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:11,599
banking applications and today  I actually want to

53
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,860
talk to you about something that has a

54
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,349
very close relationship because that is what

55
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:18,709
it connected to.  just these advantages,

56
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:21,110
these sloping banking apps or any

57
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,360
mobile app that we see as

58
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,880
these wear services works,

59
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,860
well things have changed a lot

60
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,930
since 2015 when I exhibited there on the

61
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,000
stage of the Normandy art cinema, they will

62
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,170
probably remember or did you play

63
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,210
one, you must have gone to that  talk

64
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,760
at that time and at that time the footprint

65
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,740
was based on a paradigm called

66
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,440
server site where the rendering birds

67
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,720
basically consists in that when a

68
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,480
browser sends a request to the server

69
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,230
the server what it does is send you a

70
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,160
chewed html with images with texts

71
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,880
with information and the browser receives it and

72
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,900
then it is already there, the thing is quite

73
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,270
different because there is a new paradigm

74
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:09,380
that is known as csr offline being

75
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,600
lindsay rendering well that basically

76
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,470
consists in that it is the browser or the

77
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,630
mobile application that is in charge of the

78
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,330
user interface and the only thing that is

79
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,370
exchanged between the application and the

80
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,700
server is data or the server  r

81
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,420
somehow you are going to become one

82
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,760
in a platform that has become

83
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,950
only exchanges of information there is

84
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,380
no exchange

85
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,170
of user interface elements ok so now

86
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:42,680
we have this new model in which the

87
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,020
data is what is mainly

88
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,360
transferred in the meantime  client as well as

89
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,060
the server and with this the concept

90
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,520
of bird was born, as well as the concept of

91
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,640
baviera already prior to this issue

92
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,500
of data exchange

93
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,900
through the internet and it was mainly

94
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,720
what it had to do so wishing it what

95
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,250
it has to do  With the instructions,

96
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,890
the methods that there is an object module,

97
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,500
etc., nowadays it is used more

98
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,500
to expose services to expose

99
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,830
information to be consumed by these

100
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,410
without 220 being applied or for example as ryan

101
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:22,520
as angular or by mobile apps but

102
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,020
also the apis have brought a new

103
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,720
benefit that is the fact that you

104
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,389
can automate you can monitor

105
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:31,669
what is happening within the

106
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:32,960
applications

107
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,400
within the application  is that you yourself

108
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,080
are

109
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,180
implementing or installing or making

110
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,729
use of it in your daily life so that you can

111
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:43,550
monitor and automate now

112
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:47,060
but only benefits of the time here

113
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,759
also lead to great distances in

114
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,720
fact according to a report

115
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,639
recently published by a company in addition to

116
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,490
sanz  security in the last year

117
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,520
aviz traffic increased by 141

118
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,720
percent compared to the previous year

119
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,140
and in turn malicious traffic

120
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,280
against apis increased by 348 percent and in

121
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,080
fact this same report indicates that

122
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,390
94 percent of organizations have

123
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,370
had an incident at least one

124
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,250
cybersecurity incident due to the apis

125
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,410
that they expose to the internet in the

126
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,400
last year

127
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,949
probably now I have not

128
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:27,669
heard about the habits of the geox or

129
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:29,979
more do you have several of these two ten it

130
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:32,650
is not the main totem the  unique in

131
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,509
fact there are at least five and one

132
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:36,270
of them is precisely the support of the

133
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,190
most persuasive vulnerabilities of

134
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,639
birds for which it is e  The problem now the

135
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,979
issue is that I realize that there are three

136
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:48,460
problems that go even beyond the

137
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,699
total api and are the following, the first

138
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:53,740
problem is that we do not have ideas, what we

139
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,070
have,

140
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,270
on the one hand, we use many

141
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,360
tools, we hire clouds, we occupy,

142
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,060
for example, some  states as

143
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,270
rulers we occupy

144
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,120
content management systems cms like

145
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,250
wordpress etc. we have

146
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,620
monitoring systems for example like nach llosa

147
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,800
bits we use stable data aral like

148
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,229
the blog before we called it elastic search

149
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:23,379
now the caste is read by the way we

150
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:25,780
use data makers we use

151
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,300
Jenkins action-to-file voice tools

152
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,280
that also incorporates pencil

153
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,110
these same day-to-day tools

154
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,419
development teams take up a lot of

155
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:37,210
these things like slack for example and

156
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,919
all these tools that we use

157
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:41,409
have birds that when I talk

158
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:44,530
about a tool being worthy to me  I'm

159
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,060
basing on something a manager told me

160
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,039
several years ago  when I was

161
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:50,700
looking for a replacement for nation

162
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,160
at that time I found this tool

163
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,560
of mass bits but at that time you know it

164
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,500
did not have a view then as

165
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,720
you know it did not have an app and differently it

166
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,880
found that it was not a

167
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,770
worthy tool for us to overcome it by

168
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,510
Therefore, I had you want to search for

169
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,030
an alternative so each time the

170
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,680
tools become in some way

171
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,290
more dignified and therefore they have these

172
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:16,500
they are incorporating these apps the problem

173
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,270
is that we installed these

174
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,520
tools that have built-in Avis

175
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,740
but we have no idea that they  They come

176
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,740
incorporated and many times these

177
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,510
are included by default the

178
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,970
installations of our tool

179
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:32,040
so before these apis included

180
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,050
in our tools we do not

181
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:37,020
know that many times we end up

182
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,690
exposing to the internet or even the

183
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,030
internal network for people who should not

184
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,970
see or modify information  the

185
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,170
information that is contained in

186
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,030
our tools  While

187
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:51,080
another issue is that

188
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,050
we ourselves when developing avis for

189
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,370
our applications that we

190
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,669
develop and have multiple

191
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:00,949
versions for example suppose that I was

192
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:03,770
only a fun 5 what

193
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,650
happens with the previous four

194
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,750
most of the time we do not know a

195
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,669
thing when when we change

196
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:12,889
version of an app and we forget in

197
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:15,110
front and now we forget about the

198
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:19,639
previous ones we expose ourselves to being here

199
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:22,020
in these birds in some way so

200
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,270
this is a bit like the song they

201
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,620
taught us when boys from the donkey

202
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,170
sanvicente the donkey san vicente arrive

203
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,540
in a  People then for one we have

204
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,280
birds that are included in our

205
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,020
tools that we do not know we

206
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,030
have and that they are there and that exposes

207
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,650
our information and we also have

208
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,179
old versions of the apis that we not

209
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:41,100
only develop that also expose

210
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,260
our information but of which

211
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,930
we are not  aware then the

212
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,240
first problem the second problem is

213
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,310
that we do not know what we have in what we

214
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,890
have since I mean by this

215
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:56,160
in the old traditional web of the scr

216
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,800
that I told them the chewed html is

217
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,730
basically that you have you have how to

218
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,500
know which pages or want url juris

219
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,019
you have included  Within your services

220
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:12,720
I had to build a tree, in fact, there are

221
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,790
security tools that to do

222
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,379
the analysis what they do is build

223
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:18,629
the site tree, they follow the links to

224
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:20,369
other pages of the process and they begin to

225
00:09:20,369 --> 00:09:22,110
make their corresponding analyzes

226
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,269
so you can have a cadastre  of

227
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:26,699
what you have within the website

228
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,649
that you are developing the problem

229
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:31,049
that you do not have with the different habits you do

230
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:34,170
not have in the apis some way for

231
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,689
example

232
00:09:35,689 --> 00:09:38,549
you do not have in the warnings any way to

233
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:41,339
know that you do not have a form of

234
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:44,369
hell between  the different examples and

235
00:09:44,369 --> 00:09:46,980
sexual therefore suddenly I

236
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,499
can send you perfectly some of the

237
00:09:49,499 --> 00:09:52,319
people that you have and you could

238
00:09:52,319 --> 00:09:54,869
escape from your security analysis  If

239
00:09:54,869 --> 00:09:57,420
I want to implement you, the third problem

240
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,299
is that there is still a lack to automate

241
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,220
well, at least there are not many tools yet,

242
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,889
or else there are not many

243
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:07,199
tools that allow you to do

244
00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:08,959
the job well analysis of your life,

245
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,220
mainly because they are based on

246
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,739
easy the easy one.  Technique

247
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:15,420
by which basically

248
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:19,340
what it does is try to guess

249
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,130
you have to launch where your en ponts

250
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,770
etc. are then you could have an

251
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:28,490
app and with the islands and usher but if it

252
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,560
could not be there and then the

253
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,240
tool will say the latzky

254
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,580
users apps  and there is name by and

255
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,990
basically what the tool does

256
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,570
is try to guess where your

257
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,250
examples are to be able to do the

258
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,380
corresponding scan then there are these

259
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:45,410
three problems now how to solve this

260
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,720
that

261
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,910
exist from my point of view there are

262
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,440
three solutions to solve this

263
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,460
problem

264
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,220
the old one is probably the most difficult

265
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,320
to implement and the heaviest to

266
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,070
increase,

267
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:02,280
bring me all the  s birds and when I

268
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,560
say bring me all the birds I mean

269
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,650
first to make a registry of all the

270
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:11,130
technologies that will happen is all the

271
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:14,670
slack the sónarclub ll

272
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,120
the blue the google

273
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,200
google cloud ice of that all and for

274
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,810
one you have the additional benefit to the

275
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:25,980
series  Or do you have the additional benefit

276
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,570
that you are meeting a

277
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,150
very important requirement: ice 11,000, one wants to

278
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,310
have a drastic inventory to know

279
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,140
what you are occupying in your

280
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,790
organization and the second one

281
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:42,740
will sit by default, it is activated by

282
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,819
default, you can pass  If you have abi

283
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:48,740
activated by default and you don't need them, you

284
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,860
activate them and most of the time,

285
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,170
no need, you won't need an

286
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,420
api, which is the one that will need the

287
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,050
jenkis bit, you will need the life of

288
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:04,009
tics for why now  If you have it

289
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:05,600
activated and you don't need it, you can

290
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,509
deactivate it, if you cannot deactivate it,

291
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:11,029
they will have to filter the moon,

292
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:12,379
especially if it is exposed to the

293
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:15,529
internal network or if it is exposed.  to inter the

294
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:18,069
second solution is something called

295
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:21,079
formerly called schwager nowadays

296
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:23,629
it is known as operable basically

297
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:25,040
good well a word

298
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,379
services specification is like a kind of director

299
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,269
if any of you developed

300
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:32,139
applications using

301
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:35,329
swat based notice there is an

302
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:37,970
associated technology that is  double call 'sdl that

303
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:40,399
allows you to generate a directory directory

304
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,649
where all your posts are

305
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:45,110
then the idea of having this

306
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,089
definition which is basically a file

307
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:49,670
that made a file and I talked about where

308
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,529
all the components of

309
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:53,680
shifts are included that

310
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,619
now the problem that although it is  There is

311
00:12:57,619 --> 00:12:59,360
that technology there is a bit of a problem

312
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,300
also that you are going to have to

313
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,100
document because many times you

314
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,749
have two ways in which you can

315
00:13:05,749 --> 00:13:07,730
use it for me you can

316
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,499
first write the definition and from there generate

317
00:13:09,499 --> 00:13:13,040
the code of your skillful python

318
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,759
days go by, etc. or vice versa, take your

319
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:19,369
code and generate the definition of

320
00:13:19,369 --> 00:13:22,129
tribute in any of the  You are

321
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:24,350
going to have to document two cases and that is something

322
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,569
that the developers do not like

323
00:13:26,569 --> 00:13:28,879
it was not why but unfortunately

324
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:30,350
we are going to have to do it because

325
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,899
precisely the issue of security

326
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:36,679
for birds comes from defining very

327
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:39,040
well having

328
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,170
well polished the  definitions of our

329
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,370
birds

330
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:47,300
and the third solution is to do the best

331
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,390
we can with what we have either there is not

332
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,550
much to work with I am a

333
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,140
supporter those who know me know that

334
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,029
I am a supporter

335
00:13:56,029 --> 00:13:59,450
of third-party automation that kind of thing and the

336
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,860
truth  Although there are not many

337
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,310
automatable tools, something already exists

338
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,040
and

339
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,959
can be incorporated into our

340
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,579
development process to secure

341
00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:12,889
our applications, but it is also

342
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:14,649
good to apply some recommendations

343
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:18,290
to avoid hacking against the birds that

344
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,470
we develop,

345
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,700
starting with some

346
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,280
general recommendations first.  be careful with the

347
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,290
old ones, when you are

348
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:29,850
told that there is investment, see  rsion

349
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:33,280
432 what happens with those on foot they expose

350
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,200
information and many times

351
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,810
we did not pass them we did not apply some type of

352
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:42,520
support to them nothing what happens with that and there

353
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,950
you do not have two options or you give

354
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,690
continuous support to those to my oldest

355
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,200


356
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,600
or if you  It costs a lot to make the costs

357
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,180
very large to remove them completely not to

358
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,100
occupy more

359
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,670
because that piece will remain and voted without

360
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,570
any type of support and

361
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,770
accumulating vulnerabilities because there are

362
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:04,910
some problems of the great

363
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,460
problems of legal software which

364
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,800
accumulates as the function progresses

365
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,910


366
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,310
then  when that happens it is basically

367
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:17,260
an invitation is that

368
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:21,130
the second topic is to take care of you and use it

369
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,980
well here I have been doing more hip

370
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,050
for 15 years with the star it is not

371
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,900
enough to have your server cited

372
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,000
for hd ms and it will occupy a certificate in

373
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,700
the center  that is not enough you have

374
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,250
to worry that the server is

375
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,680
well configured with secure protocols

376
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,170
with secure encryption algorithms with

377
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,910
ad validators  They all fit

378
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:47,230
several https servers that occupy s scl

379
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:51,010
2 scl 3 technologies that are no longer

380
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,900
full of security holes only I is

381
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,019
one day they

382
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:57,769
occupy md5 mediators for many

383
00:15:57,769 --> 00:15:59,899
servers it is as it is practically as

384
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:04,129
if you did not have encryption the set

385
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,050
pointed out that as if  You do not have encryption

386
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:09,290
patches sometimes it is that you have these

387
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:12,139
insecure protocols another very

388
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:16,069
important thing many times it is for a matter

389
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:18,079
perhaps of saving time of resources

390
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,899
in quotes we expose

391
00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:22,639
through our app and

392
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,230
static resources so that I mean with

393
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,879
traffic resources  I mean

394
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:30,759
images, documents and files etc.

395
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:33,319
that try to pass through the back

396
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:36,350
service, they never serve us

397
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:39,350
directly to users, it

398
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,670
has to go through some type of

399
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,499
authentication it has to go through

400
00:16:42,499 --> 00:16:44,839
some type of access control since

401
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:47,149
that is  what you have to also

402
00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:49,879
implement in your hub because if you

403
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:52,069
leave a document exposed for

404
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:53,929
anyone to do it  ace suppose that it is

405
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:57,230
a pdf I do not know 150 megabytes

406
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,540
and there are many people who start to download

407
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,270
what the server could vote they could

408
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:05,599
block access to users who

409
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,760
really need to access your

410
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,170
platform in fact we will see a little

411
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:11,750
later the  The subject of the limit rate law,

412
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,720
which is an essential tool

413
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,910
nowadays, especially in those that

414
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,440
allows you to prevent precisely these

415
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,940
denial of services attacks,

416
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,770
then also control the

417
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:25,650
static resources that go through the pike other

418
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:28,560
than to make videos directly and be

419
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,140
extremely careful  With the injections

420
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,910
formerly in the ss r model, our

421
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,190
concern was that they did not send us a

422
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,510
second injection, a cross site

423
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,250
scripting or some things and now

424
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,250
we have to worry about more things

425
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,350
that per injection if you are occupying

426
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,410
a sql database, it is not the index

427
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:49,530
jones there are injections for that type of

428
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:52,620
mongodb networking tools etc.

429
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,630
they can also be vulnerable

430
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:57,260
through software

431
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,710
you can do res  trictions you can do

432
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:04,200
jason injections that precisely what is

433
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,760
most allowed through these

434
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,820
services to be injections without

435
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,770
injections is basically the fact

436
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:11,540
that

437
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:15,090
you execute something in the shell of the operating system

438
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,679


439
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,649
the title with strings with something that

440
00:18:19,649 --> 00:18:22,110
comes from the user and there it can

441
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,360
There are vulnerabilities and ugly, for

442
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,269
example the one that happened to 5f 5,

443
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:28,590
you have probably heard about

444
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:31,139
this of this networking solution that

445
00:18:31,139 --> 00:18:33,029
has two products mainly

446
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:37,110
what is called big baby and in cue ok in

447
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,850
May of this year a

448
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,409
vulnerability arises that is  being in fact

449
00:18:40,409 --> 00:18:42,059
actively exploited even to this

450
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:44,519
day awaits I know that today

451
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:47,220
hackers have moved from

452
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,220
attacking you directly to attacking

453
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,799
your solutions and attacking your

454
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,899
suppliers or attacking your customers

455
00:18:54,899 --> 00:18:56,890
attacking your supply career

456
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,950
in order to  get there somehow and

457
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,590
then I lived and big eyes you are

458
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,740
solutions are worthy systems have

459
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:09,310
smooth once you call the c  ontrol

460
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,440
that among other things allows the

461
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,090
execution of commands in the system

462
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,850
even without the need for authentication,

463
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,300
that is, you can make the call

464
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,590
directly to this web service to this

465
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:23,140
app and without any type of identification

466
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:27,550
and easily inject an rmf

467
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:30,410
with that it could erase that the

468
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,690
operating system of this networking solution

469
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:35,240
and it would cause more of a problem for the

470
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,910
company that is occupying us,

471
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,950
already entering more

472
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,230
specific recommendations one thing that is very

473
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,420
important is to take into account the issue

474
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,400
of authorization who can do what

475
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,559
with what things we suppose  For example,

476
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,490
and 8.8 regional north would have a skillful

477
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:56,019
well-being, each of us are

478
00:19:56,019 --> 00:19:57,779
ready the event exhibitors

479
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,940
take the videos and we get on

480
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,200
then in this case here I have a

481
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,169
request in which I am uploading, let's

482
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,100
take that I was recording the

483
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,519
video of this talk  and I would upload it

484
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:11,259
through this work service then

485
00:20:11,259 --> 00:20:13,289
upload it then

486
00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:16,330
I make another request to the abi in  which

487
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:19,659
I see what the videos are

488
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:23,139
my videos percent and there as you

489
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:26,540
can see several parameters are indicated

490
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:31,610
lavín reports me that it returns several

491
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:35,940
parameters and not those gmail parameters

492
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,769
what are you going to do that I want to delete

493
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:42,000
another video that is not the one  mine

494
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,230
and my video is 616

495
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,399
suppose that francisco in the

496
00:20:47,399 --> 00:20:50,850
previous talk uploaded his talk and the air of his

497
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,340
video was 615 and I felt bad about

498
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,679
francisco because he earns so much money 2nd

499
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,570
pattern bout

500
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:00,020
then I'm not going to upload

501
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,240
it what

502
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,920
should happen  If I

503
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,010
wanted to do that, the api told me

504
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,930
that I am not authorized to

505
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,820
do that but what happens if abi

506
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,150
effectively deletes that

507
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:18,530
bona no I do not mean the scene I

508
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:20,240
mean broken opep level

509
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,760
authorization this is what this vulnerability is called

510
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,280
that has to do with

511
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,020
access to objects ok another thing is

512
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,850
access to functions

513
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:34,789
suppose that I am in the same bird of

514
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:38,360
videos of other points I see them in the

515
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,240
view my videos is not true and in some  At the

516
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,740
moment, I guess there is a

517
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:46,990
method, there is a method, there were videos in which

518
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:49,820
I should not be able to see that information

519
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,460
because I am a regular user, not only

520
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,190
the administrator, therefore, so I

521
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,470
make that request, it

522
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:59,720
should also report a 401 to

523
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,440
our code  htv and it is always about that

524
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,559
it shows me the complete video list

525
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:08,330
including those of my predecessors in

526
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:11,120
this event that is known as fl a

527
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,770
broken fans are authorized and that is

528
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,270
one thing that we have to take into

529
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,270
account when we develop Avis

530
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:22,730
validate apply and  apply what is

531
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,020
known as the principle of privilege

532
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:24,980
min

533
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,710
no one should be able to do more than their

534
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,840
fair share in any

535
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,640
information system these are very

536
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,590
old principles in fact the principle of

537
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,289
least privilege is like the year 75

538
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:38,809
more than 40 years have passed

539
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:42,860
and they are becoming more and more relevant in

540
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,409
what they have to do with the management of the

541
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:47,090
system in general,

542
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,379
software development in particular and particular cybersecurity.

543
00:22:48,379 --> 00:22:50,419
ular also

544
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:52,340
another very important thing that we have

545
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,869
to take into account when we

546
00:22:53,869 --> 00:22:55,940
develop avis is the issue of the

547
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:59,450
limit king when you expose services

548
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,690
you are basically exposing

549
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:04,370
functionality and you are exposing your

550
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,559
server to be overloaded in some

551
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,080
way or because they are sending you  many

552
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,610
requests or because they are sending you

553
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:13,789
a request that includes too much

554
00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:15,080
data,

555
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,940
here you get the concept of

556
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:20,000
mythical reyli raid limit that

557
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,929
basically consists of limiting what you receive but

558
00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:27,830
also what you send to me, for

559
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,080
example feeding by file types

560
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,309
for uploading me to this life of videos of the

561
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:36,470
8.8 north regional I should

562
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:40,250
only upload videos, not pdf, not executable,

563
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,850
not yasky files not written in gay base,

564
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:46,010
I have to validate in some way it

565
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,140
is to

566
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,630
vary files vary rest methods there are

567
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,790
a lot of rest methods

568
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:56,100
hdtv towers  jet putt of the int post

569
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,870
options 3

570
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:02,020
that many of those do not serve them they do not

571
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:05,410
serve anyone except the suits

572
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,600
how hard  and it is important to limit by

573
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,980
size

574
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,690
how much the file that I am uploading weighs

575
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:11,740


576
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,780
you can upload videos to our

577
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:16,780
platform with a maximum of 500 megabytes

578
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,240
what happens if I try to upload something very

579
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,510
heavy to the server it has been blocked by

580
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,520
how many records for example when one

581
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,040
leaves  Your imagination will probably

582
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,140
leave you busy with things such

583
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,810
as double s you make a mind a

584
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,430
double request and this does not

585
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,620
give you all the information at

586
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,690
once but tells you ok we will give you

587
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:41,000
the information but 20 out of 20

588
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,130
records  per page because we do not

589
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:45,500
want you to come later and pass as in

590
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,050
the case of the image in the figure on the

591
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:50,150
right and you at some point

592
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,160
ask us for a million records in

593
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:56,090
a single request, we no longer have to do

594
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:59,030
that type of limitation  limit by ips

595
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,700
limit by user it is already necessary to

596
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,980
have a certain control of who you

597
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,380
are limiting that information to

598
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,540
when they are the most certified areas I

599
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,070
believe that e  n more than one occasion we have

600
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:12,890
dealt with things like facebook

601
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:15,530
twitter instagram etc. and

602
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:18,880
we were assigned a touch a touch a piece of information

603
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,020
that allows us to identify ourselves in the background

604
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,300
and with that it says ok that they

605
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,420
are red and it leads to 10 requests in

606
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:29,000
the last  hour and the maximum is 20 to the

607
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,160
twenty-first we block it until

608
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,810
the hour passes and to

609
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:36,830
me the very important thing is to limit

610
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:39,870
the authentication attempts many

611
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:43,680
systems many systems do not have the

612
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,830
ability for someone to try to make

613
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,960
an attack brute force block it for

614
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,480
example  on the fifth attempt and with that the

615
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,670
servers become overloaded but

616
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:56,880
there is also the risk that the

617
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,890
authentication data will be filtered, the passwords,

618
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,950
for example user 3, must

619
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:03,600
then limit the

620
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,600
certification attempts but also limit the

621
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,480
requests made by the

622
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,740
authenticated users of tests

623
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,360
Another vulnerability to the wall that

624
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,830
paying a lot of attention to it is called more

625
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,080
blood

626
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,500
we return to the example of the api of  8.8 already

627
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,620
this api of people as we see that I uploaded

628
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:26,700
a shortlist then he checked again the list

629
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,429
of the talks, the talks that I

630
00:26:29,429 --> 00:26:32,909
uploaded and when he returned to the view to

631
00:26:32,909 --> 00:26:35,130
spend the ones that I uploaded, I was told that

632
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:39,179
the video I uploaded includes  the

633
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:41,809
light in data includes the file name

634
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:44,309
but also includes this parameter that

635
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:47,250
says conversion for month to be a

636
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,500
strange request and here because

637
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,600
it gives me that and I start to look and it

638
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,700
turns out that the data that is in the one that

639
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,049
says h 64  I do not know it is a

640
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:59,610
parameter that you give to a

641
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,620
command line tool called

642
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,320
efe efe mp

643
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,410
that what allows you is to take videos and

644
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:09,170
backwards with converting them to

645
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,670
different formats of life

646
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:14,160
this by command line

647
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,190
what happens is that  I

648
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:20,130
do not make a putt but to upload a

649
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,960
new version of my video for example if

650
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,740
I had I know that I would take the video

651
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:28,050
modify it I make it shorter a little in

652
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,090
some things in between a

653
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:32,130
small edit I lower it from low

654
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:33,870
resolution  so that it weighs less etcetera

655
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:36,280
and I upload it again

656
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,070
but I upload with heidi or know how to replace it

657
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:42,550
but also I include this

658
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:46,030
pans conversion parameter and it turns out that the here

659
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:49,480
receives it processes it and sends it to the

660
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,270
command line to do that of codec h

661
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:55,420
264 that  it happens it is known it is running as

662
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:58,150
root it is known it is running as

663
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:00,250
root and that command is executed that comes

664
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,380
immediately after 2 amper

665
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:06,160
stan and eyes remember that today

666
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,200
Linux is as an operating system is on its

667
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,270
anniversary so you will probably

668
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,800
have realized that  is what would happen

669
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,980
if you want to pass that which they eat

670
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,020
then the more assignment is based

671
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,840
basically on the fact that

672
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,980
you do not control which fields

673
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,990
of jason that users send you

674
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:29,020
can modify or you can

675
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,410
alter some

676
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,510
other things they have to do with  the

677
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,430
tokens that not only occupy a very

678
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:39,060
widespread technology for tokens is jw

679
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:42,510
of the jason day software tokens is the

680
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,550
first thing to take into account the

681
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,720
external counters  rnos are to

682
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,020
authenticate users and adolescents

683
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,690
are claims are statements are

684
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:54,690
klein and students trajectory that

685
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,910
authenticates this and you pass this

686
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:59,040
element this see it as the mobility pass the

687
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,310
mobility base you already

688
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:05,660
said you already say hey I'm cristian roja

689
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,760
but there in  the mobility pass says I do not

690
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,860
have the two doses set therefore

691
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,390
I can go in to have a beer

692
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:16,050
in the sea and that is what the

693
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,360
players are for

694
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,429
so some things to take into

695
00:29:19,429 --> 00:29:21,470
account when one occupies these

696
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:24,290
double jacks of entry the secret that is

697
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:27,559
the  secret that is included within this

698
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:30,590
token that allows you in the background to

699
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:33,380
validate that a trick ticket does not come and go

700
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:36,679
to pass or have an incorrect plan

701
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:38,660
the idea is that it is no more random and

702
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,330
long özil the site is not a secret

703
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:43,420
sometimes  when you are

704
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:46,720
going to start to generate a lot of

705
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,600
external jw test truchos the other does not

706
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,850
extract or lower than the rhythm define to be

707
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:54,580
specified that you can play more or

708
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,780
signature said

709
00:29:55,780 --> 00:30:01,330
sorry if asymmetric photography rsa h

710
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:03,220
will define the time out as short as

711
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,740
possible depending above all on wanting

712
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:08,500
your business need ok why is it going to

713
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,960
happen that while it is in operations

714
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,870
the person from web services can change

715
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:17,410
some type of privilege already and some

716
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,880
klein of  this person can do the

717
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,669
inba lyon

718
00:30:20,669 --> 00:30:24,119
and finally another one of not storing

719
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:27,029
sensitive information in the east touch

720
00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:29,489
since it could be easily encoded

721
00:30:29,489 --> 00:30:31,350
the only thing that should not be put in these

722
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,359
more tokens is hopefully in the

723
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:36,989
username and the klein a I am admin I have

724
00:30:36,989 --> 00:30:39,389
access to this folder or to this list of

725
00:30:39,389 --> 00:30:41,669
folders that kind of thing but do not put

726
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:44,429
passwords ip addresses and

727
00:30:44,429 --> 00:30:47,309
identifiable information of external users in

728
00:30:47,309 --> 00:30:48,690
fact a very interesting tool

729
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:51,029
is that you occupy the jota doublet is

730
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:54,029
one that is going to ajw tool that allows you

731
00:30:54,029 --> 00:30:56,580
basically to take  copy and paste the

732
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,639
string because this doublet

733
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:02,220
j with sting is a very long you

734
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,749
pass it to the tool via command line  ta

735
00:31:03,749 --> 00:31:05,669
and you can ask them to do

736
00:31:05,669 --> 00:31:08,220
different analysis which

737
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,929
validation algorithm you are using or what is the

738
00:31:09,929 --> 00:31:12,559
time out if you are dealing with one

739
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:17,658
that is playing an adequate secret or

740
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:23,510
not, which is very important that this

741
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,490
tool is super powerful if you  It will

742
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:26,529
help quite

743
00:31:26,529 --> 00:31:29,360
another very interesting thing is that there is

744
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,720
another way to make these websites, it was also

745
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,270
used for keto and a

746
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,760
much safer alternative mainly

747
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,700
because the developers and

748
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,200
someone may feel offended by the

749
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,220
developers are thus

750
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,830
distracting us from security issues

751
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,660
most of the time so when

752
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,860
one is with the sides they are

753
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,390
worrying bossio but what

754
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:56,750
area algorithm are we going to take case signature in

755
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,809
asymmetric lithography or is it no

756
00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:01,640
crisis or no variation

757
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,920
one could put touches that they do not forget

758
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,830
already and there with that anyone  I could throw

759
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:11,309
that it touches is trout already then

760
00:32:11,309 --> 00:32:13,740
then in jota w there are too many

761
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,210
things that one has to worry about

762
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:17,999
For keto what good technology called

763
00:32:17,999 --> 00:32:20,850
platform Carlos tics follow and tokens

764
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:22,230
the only thing the developer has to worry about

765
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,809
when he uses more this is

766
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:27,539
which version of Cuba bases and in the

767
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:29,399
version it is contained occupies this

768
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:31,320
variation algorithm always occupies

769
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,090
tourism of obligation  The algorithm never happens, it never happens, it never happens,

770
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:35,730


771
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:37,039
everything has to be not authenticated

772
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,840
and to

773
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,590
what mechanisms, etc.,

774
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:45,529
then it passes to provides the possibility of

775
00:32:45,529 --> 00:32:47,779
having greater security without sacrificing

776
00:32:47,779 --> 00:32:50,000
simplicity, it is to make it as simple as

777
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,820
possible to begin with and also provides a

778
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,320
very interesting property called

779
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,419
cryptographic agility which is

780
00:32:56,419 --> 00:32:58,159
basically a property that allows

781
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,860
systems to adapt or

782
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,299
scale to new

783
00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:04,640
cryptographic algorithms in a simple way and not

784
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,770
have to go around revalidating all the

785
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:09,080
tokens if a new validation algorithm appears,

786
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,770


787
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:15,030
another very important thing that is used every

788
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:17,340
time.  uses more of a technology called

789
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:22,020
draft and the draft is a basic  camente a

790
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:26,150
language of where and for Friday it is

791
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:28,770
good that you basically demand the

792
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,840
foundation with I want this data of

793
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,650
this data and this data and the web

794
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,720
service responds with the information that you

795
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,010
told it

796
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:40,650
much more it is much more flexible than

797
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:43,170
occupying only one  and exclusively rest to be

798
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:45,720
able to make the requests to the

799
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,180
server, greater control over

800
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,640
the data is offered now, as it is a query language,

801
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,880
this can be abused,

802
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,650
therefore it is necessary to take certain

803
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:57,840
measures is that they occupy this technology,

804
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,970
for example, limit the depth of

805
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,200
The qualis the case that you see

806
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,900
above on the right is the case of an

807
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,940
agreement that could overload the

808
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,890
server and caused a

809
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:11,610
denial of service attack

810
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:14,159
only establish that

811
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,530
which have a certain

812
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:19,560
depth and nothing more than that and the

813
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,710
second  It is page of appropriately that

814
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,989
in the case of the photo because the figure is on the

815
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:28,469
left to

816
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:31,320
establish some kind of limit that in

817
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,080
the users  You or the

818
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,090
clients cannot be passed to a

819
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:38,119
certain amount of records that

820
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:41,510
the api returns

821
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:45,340
analyze which is the case below that is

822
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:48,520
where there is an asterisk being that is

823
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,830
basically bring me all the users

824
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,840
what happens if you say a million

825
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,879
users in this  In stock,

826
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,480
the visa takes a long time to process, it

827
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,710
will leave you

828
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:02,380
in a very long round trip but it

829
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:05,020
could also happen that the server is what

830
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,440
it is or it falls,

831
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,760
another very important thing is to implement

832
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,300
time out and if the requests

833
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,700
take a long time  cut the rules and

834
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:19,119
somehow informal the client to

835
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,430


836
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:25,030
see that they distribute their accounts and their

837
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,770
requests in multiple basic requests

838
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:29,100


839
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,750
now as developers we like

840
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:36,030
when we see security talks,

841
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:38,370
development etc. we like to play with

842
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,920
the tool and I leave them with a  with

843
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,020
two tools mainly the

844
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,260
first is one is a type analyzer

845
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,930
up to once that last until

846
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:51,270
you can integrate the study like that

847
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,010
really fancy of the

848
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:55,770
developers nowadays that this

849
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:58,830
plugin that downturn and your range your window

850
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:02,100
gen you in your son is what you take your

851
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,830
definition of his yesterday young abby and you cloth

852
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,440
meat there it begins to review

853
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,660
security problems that you could have and in

854
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,920
based on that I had a score

855
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,470
and you have a score of 76 it has a

856
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:17,020
percentage of 18 it has a percentage of

857
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,930
95 and so you can yourself

858
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:22,420
developer before uploading the podium to the

859
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,700
repository you yourself can take

860
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,650
charge and start

861
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:28,940
and begin to correct the

862
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,040
vulnerabilities to  As you want

863
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,920
this tool from the volta bars

864
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,569
and the second tool with which I

865
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:37,069
do not want to leave there are many

866
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:40,100
development teams that occupy

867
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,620
hitler island in its version and ultimate has

868
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,360
an integrated tool that what it

869
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,730
does is

870
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:49,370
also take a skillful open definition but

871
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:51,590
in  This case does not remain solely and

872
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:54,380
exclusively with the fact that it does not want to

873
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,840
analyze the code of that

874
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,700
definition, but what it does is

875
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:02,300
launch a launch to  Some container and

876
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,550
start doing tests on each

877
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,500
of the nodes on each of the

878
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,110
thugs of this picket or you are

879
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,910
developing and reporting

880
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:13,040
vulnerabilities that are counting

881
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,430
as you are scanned is already a

882
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:18,440
super powerful tool and in fact

883
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,960
probably the most powerful that  You

884
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,600
can do to secure your APIs is

885
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,740
to use both tools

886
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,500
indistinctly because one analyzes the

887
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,320
architecture of an architecture analyst

888
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,890
of your bird and the other analyzes the

889
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,540
current behavior

890
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,940
and two super important factors to

891
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:41,710
maintain security in our blood

892
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,910
and starting to close

893
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:47,329
every day we  we occupy more Avis and

894
00:37:47,329 --> 00:37:50,480
we install tools that

895
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,880
have the built-in ones, we

896
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,950
develop open ones of which we

897
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:57,349
have no idea or we do not control

898
00:37:57,349 --> 00:37:59,440
what is happening with them and

899
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,470
precisely for that very reason

900
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:06,049
as we have more apis greater

901
00:38:06,049 --> 00:38:07,339
in our surface of  attack the

902
00:38:07,339 --> 00:38:08,960
data surface which is a very

903
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,670
important concept  cybersecurity sign that

904
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:13,490
basically consists

905
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:15,440
of how many doors and windows

906
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,539
farmers could try to get into your

907
00:38:17,539 --> 00:38:19,670
system through as you have more

908
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,500
doors and windows

909
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:26,119
mcs more attempts to be able to make the

910
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:28,640
entrance infrastructure crackers

911
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,470
your software extract

912
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:32,960
information destroy information perhaps

913
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,440
implant some ransomware etc

914
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,930
and finally if the development

915
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,369
of security tools for visas

916
00:38:40,369 --> 00:38:43,510
is more or less slow there are not many and

917
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:46,550
still it is and we can integrate it into

918
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,920
our development and also take into

919
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,560
account good practices in use

920
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,900
Only tools does not help you

921
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,930
to adequately ensure to

922
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:57,829
properly secure

923
00:38:57,829 --> 00:39:00,380
any software system etc. you

924
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,569
also have to put a little

925
00:39:02,569 --> 00:39:04,880
head on and follow the

926
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,339
recommendations that I was giving you

927
00:39:06,339 --> 00:39:10,119
during today's talk

928
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,360
I want to thank 8.8 regional north

929
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,619
for the invitation

930
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:17,290
thank you for

931
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:20,390
lending with me  llones on this occasion and

932
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:22,220
came to your disposal for the

933
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,770
questions that I have left to be so

934
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:27,020
doctor zombies that goes so much

935
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,270
thank you very much stay safe thanks to

936
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,410
degree that we are waiting for the

937
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,000
questions while they are selected

938
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,500
can sandoval pete asks the following

939
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,080
kristen what would be the  stages that

940
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,880
should be done in an area where there are no

941
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,830
security controls in relation to

942
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:42,290
developments in relation to the apis

943
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:44,000
where we should start where they should

944
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,150
actually start

945
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:49,099
by should I start I interpret as

946
00:39:49,099 --> 00:39:51,819
taking lsd the s which is the

947
00:39:51,819 --> 00:39:55,730
life cycle of  software development

948
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:57,530
and take this concept that many

949
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:59,119
times that many people adopted that is

950
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,460
the already sensitive cif left is that it

951
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,950
means that you have all these

952
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:06,490
steps of the software development cycle

953
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:09,410
requirements design and

954
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:11,540
implementation testing and putting into

955
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:14,569
production and for  Generally, security issues

956
00:40:14,569 --> 00:40:16,280
are seen

957
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,410
when you have finished developing the programs.

958
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:21,440
application and do your tests but

959
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,790
security is something that you have to

960
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:24,790
start planning from the beginning that is,

961
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:28,930
the most left model possible

962
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:31,400
to properly apply the

963
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,180
security requirements from the beginning and the

964
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,710
subject and is that usually the

965
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,329
requirements of  security will not come

966
00:40:38,329 --> 00:40:41,119
from your client you have to put it and

967
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,859
for that you have to inform yourself

968
00:40:42,859 --> 00:40:45,079
we had to read start

969
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:46,790
exploring options also start

970
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:49,730
reviewing tools things

971
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:51,140
like habits

972
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,090
to start worrying about

973
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:55,520
security from the beginning  Do not leave it

974
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,530
until when you have finished programming

975
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:59,600
and started your tests and there we started

976
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,090
to do the security tests of

977
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:04,310
ours is the recommendation that I

978
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:07,569
would give to the people who are wondering,

979
00:41:07,569 --> 00:41:10,619
we have here

980
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:13,690
it says what would be a good model of

981
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:15,519
good practices to protect

982
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:18,209
our apis

983
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:23,050
good practices and I would start by

984
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:26,030
doing what has waters, there are glasses, it

985
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:29,930
has several guides in addition to the  of

986
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:31,490
habits,

987
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,620
there are several guides that are specific

988
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,720
to certain technologies, for example you

989
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,720
have a chipip fabric as they call it

990
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,610
since they are like returns like tor

991
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:43,850
but now you can look for torpedoes for

992
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:46,940
graciela torpedoes for rest etc. I

993
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,660
think it is a good way  from starting

994
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:52,190
the security issue from the validity

995
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:54,830
of the security issue in development there is another

996
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:57,790
thing that me too the abbot 'top-ten'

997
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:00,230
proactive control the

998
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:02,780
proactive security controls waters that

999
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,340
a super good starting point

1000
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,470
for any developer to

1001
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:08,060
start  to apply good

1002
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,620
independent security practices that are

1003
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,170
developing a mobile application,

1004
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:16,160
a web page with scr,

1005
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,100
an api and whatever, then I

1006
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,050
think a good starting point would be

1007
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:22,880
the documentation that is

1008
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,450
publicly available to the eye site

1009
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:29,089
perfect we are waiting for more questions

1010
00:42:29,089 --> 00:42:30,440
that are separating because there are several

1011
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,910
loans both select the best that

1012
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:34,570
we can  Precisely not to

1013
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:37,010
try to make the most of the time

1014
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:38,380
that we have

1015
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,599
while we wait for it to

1016
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,760
load in the rest of the chat in our

1017
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,270
beloved example between video border, we

1018
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:48,650
take the opportunity to tell you that if you have

1019
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,960
any questions from the peace line chat

1020
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,359
you can participate by tempos you can

1021
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:55,369
participate  for prizes that we have

1022
00:42:55,369 --> 00:42:58,130
especially for you who are

1023
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:00,260
connected at this time in regional north

1024
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:03,500
8.8 in the case you need to encrypt data in

1025
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,750
a database what tools are

1026
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,820
recommended in case of using a

1027
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:10,010
password key for data encryption

1028
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:12,200
with a database and taking into account

1029
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,619
Note that every x time it should be

1030
00:43:15,619 --> 00:43:17,270
changed every so often the password should be changed

1031
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:18,349


1032
00:43:18,349 --> 00:43:20,980
when it is compromised

1033
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:23,380
to see that question I think it has two

1034
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,480
parts the first is how to encrypt

1035
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,040
data within the database there are

1036
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,470
technologies that allow you to

1037
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:35,170
encrypt the data  before uploading them to

1038
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:37,090
the database and a technology

1039
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:38,830
called will be reported will be

1040
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:41,230
tr  Ansparente encryption or transparent

1041
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:44,590
was registration already has because you

1042
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:46,270
can find out I know that

1043
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:48,520
more commercial tools such as sql server as

1044
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,250
now have

1045
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:52,480
mysql

1046
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,119
hype of belle things and you have to take

1047
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:57,880
some intermediate step

1048
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,310
the solution is slaves in fact they

1049
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:02,230
allow you to generate databases the

1050
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:05,050
which allow you to incorporate in a

1051
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:07,570
fairly easy way this transparency and

1052
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:09,550
registration now regarding the issue of

1053
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:12,790
changing passwords from time

1054
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:15,130
to time in the community if the security of that

1055
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:17,440
during the last year and a half as

1056
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,720
it is gradually leaving that of

1057
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,640
changing passwords  bases for is every so often

1058
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,770
and it is moving to a

1059
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:25,810
hockey scheme they change by step but when you

1060
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:27,759
have a kind of suspicion that they

1061
00:44:27,759 --> 00:44:29,559
are looting you because that is what happens

1062
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:30,789
many times when you change the

1063
00:44:30,789 --> 00:44:33,369
password that when you change the rules you

1064
00:44:33,369 --> 00:44:35,529
have  that decrypt everything and re-

1065
00:44:35,529 --> 00:44:37,119
encrypt everything that you are in a

1066
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:38,680
database and following these

1067
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:41,289
structures are demanding  users who

1068
00:44:41,289 --> 00:44:43,990
change their data to do your time I

1069
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:45,309
think that it has happened to all of us, for

1070
00:44:45,309 --> 00:44:46,749
example on the page of our box

1071
00:44:46,749 --> 00:44:49,240
that you connect you want to do an

1072
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,430
operation of a radio banking person

1073
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:53,650
and the ship as if it surprises you with

1074
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:56,529
this request for  hey you go word has

1075
00:44:56,529 --> 00:44:59,470
more than six months change the time and one

1076
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:01,900
the truth is that it does not have much that is

1077
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:04,779
one does not create good passwords if in

1078
00:45:04,779 --> 00:45:06,519
fact with the case of Chile the

1079
00:45:06,519 --> 00:45:08,170
same banks do not have very good

1080
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:10,480
requirements for passwords of  limit

1081
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,920
to a maximum of four six eight

1082
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,019
characters so that also

1083
00:45:14,019 --> 00:45:15,700
becomes a problem

1084
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:17,859
so I would say that those two

1085
00:45:17,859 --> 00:45:20,829
recommendations take care of and limit

1086
00:45:20,829 --> 00:45:22,750
this thing or eliminate this

1087
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:24,339
requirement of changing the base

1088
00:45:24,339 --> 00:45:26,589
every so often to a requirement to

1089
00:45:26,589 --> 00:45:29,109
change it more  For in case of gender suspicion

1090
00:45:29,109 --> 00:45:31,470


1091
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:33,240
I have a user question what

1092
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,770
tools do you recommend on the same

1093
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:36,560
previous question to raise this

1094
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,560
information

1095
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:42,470
as if I did not understand  We endorse and although they

1096
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:44,599
want you to now lie paradigms

1097
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:46,099
as to answer the previous question

1098
00:45:46,099 --> 00:45:48,710
to be useful to precisely comply with

1099
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:50,930
the requirements mentioned above

1100
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:53,599
in your answer, look for what is

1101
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:56,710
transparent,

1102
00:45:57,509 --> 00:45:59,989
do not hesitate, you can install something on a

1103
00:45:59,989 --> 00:46:03,419
physical server or in our employees that

1104
00:46:03,419 --> 00:46:08,009
is  It calls hsm and hsm is a chip that can

1105
00:46:08,009 --> 00:46:11,839
be physical or virtual in which

1106
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:14,909
the passwords are contained and he is in

1107
00:46:14,909 --> 00:46:16,679
charge of encrypting and decrypting but

1108
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:18,779
you cannot enter to take out the

1109
00:46:18,779 --> 00:46:21,299
boy's garbage in fact if you try to open

1110
00:46:21,299 --> 00:46:22,769
the chip and remove  the garbage in some

1111
00:46:22,769 --> 00:46:25,739
way the chip remains at zero and that they

1112
00:46:25,739 --> 00:46:29,549
have used there is already a standard that

1113
00:46:29,549 --> 00:46:32,399
is fill 141 2 that establishes the

1114
00:46:32,399 --> 00:46:34,619
requirements for these tools for

1115
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:36,479
these hs tools and in what is the

1116
00:46:36,479 --> 00:46:38,459
main thing that is used when you deal with

1117
00:46:38,459 --> 00:46:41,339
this  Transparent technology you see

1118
00:46:41,339 --> 00:46:42,640


1119
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,910
perfect scripts Cristian I want to thank you for your

1120
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:47,529
time I have to go

1121
00:46:47,529 --> 00:46:48,789
unfortunately squeeze a little bit

1122
00:46:48,789 --> 00:46:50,650
to be able  r continue with our scheme

1123
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:52,599
I want to thank time I would like you to

1124
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:53,769
give your networks because there are many

1125
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,089
more questions to leave than comment or

1126
00:46:55,089 --> 00:46:57,640
talk with you or have any questions I

1127
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,579
do not know if it is possible they can not put the

1128
00:47:00,579 --> 00:47:05,190
food because the link is

1129
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,760
on the screen

1130
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,890
has wanted the director  You have to

1131
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:11,880
share the screen with you,

1132
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:15,210
but from a blanket and

1133
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:18,480
the qr precisely and to be able to solve the

1134
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,789
questions that remain pending,

1135
00:47:20,789 --> 00:47:24,119
there it is for you to talk

1136

that we soon intend to be able to

1147
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:50,760
leave this virtual plane to be able to

1148
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,580
go directly to the face-to-face channel

1149

programming our dear but that the

1158
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,140
programming that we have destined for
