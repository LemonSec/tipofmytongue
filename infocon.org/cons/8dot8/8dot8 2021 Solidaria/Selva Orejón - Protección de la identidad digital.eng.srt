1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,360
I like it

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,170
well

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:17,599
[Music]

4
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:36,309
[Music]

5
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:55,840
[Music]

6
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:03,199
and

7
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,560
[Music]

8
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,259
and we are back as I told you

9
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:21,329
now part of our second half of

10
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:23,399
the conference and we have this second

11
00:01:23,399 --> 00:01:26,220
luxury block in fact I have the pleasure

12
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,799
and honor to present it  orejón that

13
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,990
for the first time is debuting with

14
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,460
us in 8.8 and I am going to say a

15
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,229
confidentiality perhaps I do not know but

16
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:39,720
Chema presented it to me so they will

17
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,899
probably go to Chema

18
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:45,060
so watch I want to thank you for your

19
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,740
time because I imagine that just like

20
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,110
that belongs to everyone is very scarce

21
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,190
today so welcome to 8.8 solidarity

22
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,509
and thank you very much for your support, nice

23
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:57,270
time, thank you very much to all of

24
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,110
you so if I am a friend of Chema and I am

25
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,830
already very honored so I will start to

26
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,569
explain a little who  I am

27
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:08,098
where I come from and I am not going to explain it

28
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:09,989
today at this time

29
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:12,360
I repeat that we have together the first thing of

30
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,769
all is to say that for me it is a

31
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:17,410
real pleasure to be here

32
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,420
well I am a person who has

33
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,460
m  Very sensitive to

34
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,680
human issues in my family we have

35
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,750
different people with different

36
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,510
types of at times with

37
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,020
different functionalities and for me

38
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,360
all my life has been living with

39
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,860
people who are completely

40
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,840
different from each other but very

41
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,140
equal so good from the  The team

42
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,310
we have is an

43
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,290
absolutely diverse team among

44
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,600
criminologist psychologists who generate

45
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,480
content, people who dedicate themselves

46
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,040
well to the world of martial arts,

47
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,780
others who dedicate themselves to issues more

48
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,970
related only to

49
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,610
cybersecurity, because in any case my

50
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,360
life is the I don't know about  the things that are most

51
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,080
similar to a Netflix episode

52
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,510
so part of it I would like to be able to

53
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,060
share today so that

54
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,330
we could get closer to what we

55
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,460
call the black market, the black market

56
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,110
linked to social networks

57
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,940
to protect our

58
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,180
digital

59
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,310
identity.  to go a little to it,

60
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,670
the first of all is to explain  What part

61
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,260
of the work that we do and

62
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,120
I always speak in the plural because I do not

63
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,630
work alone I always work as a team

64
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,640
and the great luck we have is that

65
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,320
apart from the work we do on a day-

66
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,940
to-day basis in our company,

67
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,530
we are also teachers at the school of

68
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,240
police in the

69
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,600
public security institute and there we teach them three

70
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,060
different subjects one that is or

71
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,130
inadvertently or intelligent pension first

72
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,600
investigation and protection of

73
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,610
digital identity we help them

74
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,370
so that both members of

75
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,050
the state security forces and bodies can

76
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,090
be protected  but they can also

77
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,070
obtain information that can

78
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,540
help protect the identity of

79
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,760
different people we also work

80
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,550
openly for the Spanish judicial service

81
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,310
we have given classes in the

82
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,680
general council of the judiciary and for other

83
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,770
police officers not only in Catalonia not

84
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,709
only in the rest of Spain  but

85
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,570
we have also given classes in

86
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,560
portugal and also in israel

87
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,770
pu  It is good from the month of March of

88
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,230
last year more or less we began to see that

89
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,630
there was like an explosion not only

90
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,850
of the use and abuse that was being

91
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,650
done by people who

92
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,660
are minors in social networks

93
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,760
but also by  of many

94
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,500
public figures that deep down

95
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,290
are also generating a

96
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,180
public opinion and a state of opinion on

97
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,240
different topics from different

98
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,010
sectors and it was very curious because

99
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,720
we began to see that there are a lot of

100
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,870
criminals and I say criminals that

101
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,970
here already in this forum do not do  Needless to

102
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,410
say, but well in other forums

103
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,460
signed, it is necessary to remember what we are going

104
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,880
to differentiate during all this little

105
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,250
day between what are

106
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,620
pure and tough criminals, which in this case because for

107
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,060
me they are all those people who

108
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,910
commit different types of crimes

109
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,860
specifically based on  The penal code

110
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,380
that we have to do now in this case would be

111
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,820
Spanish because they are almost

112
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,600
overworked and they commit abuses against

113
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,669
not only cu  Any profile but

114
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:29,350
especially against minors and

115
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:29,680
this

116
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,330
is going completely on the increase,

117
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,440
we will see what is the benefit that

118
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,750
different criminals are obtaining from

119
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,139
the fact of hacking the accounts

120
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:43,000
in social profiles for example of

121
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,400
instagram of twitter of 'tik tok' but

122
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,630
also  what are the consequences

123
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,880
for the digital identity of these

124
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,009
people and also of these companies of

125
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:53,139
the hacks they are suffering and we will see

126
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:55,660
some of the different techniques we

127
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,280
use to be able to recover these

128
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,289
profiles in social networks that is

129
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:00,789
becoming one of the

130
00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:03,460
products almost  more good products or

131
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,470
services more star of recent

132
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,900
times first of all and to

133
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,800
understand it

134
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,360
we would have to explain what is the modus

135
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,669
operandi as they hack for example and

136
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:14,860
we have chosen this instagram network that is

137
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,020
one of the most used the first of

138
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,440
all is that the  victim receives a

139
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,660
private message a dm

140
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,700
in which he is apparently

141
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,260
writing to him  or the official instagram support,

142
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,840
what they do is personalize

143
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,389
the profile photo,

144
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:33,710
personalize in the description and the

145
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,610
name of the profile, but generally

146
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:40,580
they also change the url of the profile or it

147
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,280
may be that they keep the same in

148
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,530
some of the different profiles but

149
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,479
that the user does not  he realizes because

150
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:49,639
when he is receiving it he sees that they

151
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,770
are writing to him from an account that

152
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,169
has quite a few followers that has

153
00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:56,720
all the appearance of being the

154
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,300
official instagram support page itself

155
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,050
but it is not and the instagram account

156
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:05,180
that is writing that message

157
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,979
Generally speaking, it would be that of a

158
00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:09,050
known contact who has already been

159
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,060
hacked and that on some occasions

160
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,340
when the profile is privatized, for

161
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,770
that reason, you may receive a direct message from

162
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,990
a person who is known only that they

163
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,570
have completely changed the profile is

164
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,669
the carnival party of  the profiles

165
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:24,249
for this

166
00:07:24,249 --> 00:07:26,709
in the private message generally what

167
00:07:26,709 --> 00:07:28,749
they do is use a shortened link

168
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:32,559
with a url  With a domain that is very

169
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:35,559
similar to instagram but is

170
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:37,179
fishing, what happens is that it is not

171
00:07:37,179 --> 00:07:39,669
perceptible to the person who

172
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:42,369
is receiving the message, it

173
00:07:42,369 --> 00:07:44,949
usually makes the user think that he is

174
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:46,779
infringing the copyright rules of

175
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:49,849
instagram or what

176
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:52,129
It may be that you have the opportunity to

177
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:54,229
verify your account, they have more or less

178
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:56,719
these two ways, the first is

179
00:07:56,719 --> 00:07:58,399
that it is infringing its copyright rules,

180
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:01,459
what makes the user

181
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:03,289
get very nervous thinking that they are going

182
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:04,939
to close the profile then how  He

183
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:06,740
gets so nervous because he thinks that they are

184
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,629
going to close his profile that is the

185
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:11,300
perfect moment in which the user clicks on

186
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,309
the phishing link and automatically

187
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:15,979
what he does is as if the session had been left

188
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:17,869
since putting a user

189
00:08:17,869 --> 00:08:20,509
password is first  of phising but

190
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:22,490
that when people are nervous, they

191
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,420
usually believe

192
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,430
what happens next, well,

193
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,050
what they do is that since they have already

194
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,850
accessed the instagram account of es  This person

195
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,540
looks

196
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,179
at many of the clients despite

197
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:36,820
having double verification activated

198
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,250
both through the application and

199
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,539
through SMS when they receive that

200
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:43,960
code

201
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,080
the criminal tells them they will have received

202
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,720
a six-digit code write us

203
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,520
what is the code of  six digits and

204
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,440
people write it the moment

205
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,300
they write it, the other is already opening

206
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,450
the session of his instagram with

207
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,220
the victim's account, with which they

208
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,620
automatically change the password,

209
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,510
they are kicked out of the sessions of the

210
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,360
devices that were from  their confidence in

211
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,250
the case that the victim does not have the double

212
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,870
verification factor activated, they

213
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,550
activate it with a phone number of the

214
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,490
offender and there what they do is two

215
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:18,400
things one they delete the photographs

216
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,130
from the victim's timeline or they archive them in

217
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,200
the case in  The fact that your profile is going to be

218
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,750
used to extort money will

219
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,030
be archived and they will make you believe

220
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,710
that the information has been deleted and

221
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,690
that if you want to recover it, then what  That I

222
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:34,570
pay you the amount that we will now see and on

223
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,730
some other occasions if the profile is going

224
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,740
to be used for other purposes

225
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,690
directly what they do is delete

226
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:43,450
that information change the

227
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,850
profile image change the description and it is

228
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,710
ready to be used as a

229
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,840
hook and  In a few days it will

230
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,940
sometimes be sold and we will also

231
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,820
see how much each of

232
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,380
our accounts is selling for depending on the number

233
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,240
of followers we have or depending

234
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,520
on whether or not the account is a verified account,

235
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,670


236
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,850
there are other difficult techniques, for example

237
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:06,840
to  be able to

238
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,940
hack users who are anonymous in

239
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,550
a more massive way and from accounts that

240
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,560
do have credibility with which they

241
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,510
can hack, for example, the account of

242
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,460
a public figure of an influencer

243
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,130
of public opinion by sending

244
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,780
or publishing an exclusive offer

245
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,540
with a link for example for the purchase

246
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,880
of reyval which is what they are doing and

247
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,130
this happens to a client of ours they

248
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,960
used their  account that he had 16

249
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,850
and a half million followers which is

250
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:35,000
enough and is a speaker

251
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,420
large enough to be able to

252
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,670
use one of his publications as

253
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,980
if it were an exclusive offer so

254
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,620
that when the different followers

255
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,140
are seeing that publication or have

256
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,060
received a notification that that

257
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,510
user has made a publication they go to

258
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:58,530
a link or they go to an offer that when they

259
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,930
click on it they are making a

260
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:03,270
payment to a paypal account which is

261
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:06,440
clearly not the paypal

262
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,750
king van account but is the paypal account

263
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,660
of the criminals but of course  How is it

264
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,120
being done from an

265
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,890
account profile that, in addition to being verified

266
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,780
from a public person that

267
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,820
we are following, gains

268
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,400
all possible credibility by being able to

269
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,510
proceed to the verified user hello hello

270
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,250
public person, of course it has

271
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,020
a high community and that is  a

272
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,360
person who has a certain credibility

273
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,130
because the promotion obviously passes

274
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,500
as if it were real users  ios pican

275
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,660
enter the data in some cases of

276
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,150
paypal others on other occasions of the

277
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,700
card itself and remember that

278
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,160
most of the users on the internet continue to

279
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,870
use credit cards to be

280
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:50,540
able to make their payments or debit cards with

281
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,460
which it is no longer just that  The glasses are never going to get to them, they are

282
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,560
knocked down,

283
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,410
but they are also giving address information,

284
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,830
full names and surnames,

285
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:04,130
email and bank details

286
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,730
or payment details,

287
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:09,760
then we have another type of glasses

288
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,800
that they do, which is economic extortion

289
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,230
to the  acquaintances of the victim one of the

290
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,490
things they do is and is a

291
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,529
public figure or in the caste that is an

292
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,570
anonymous character the criminals what

293
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,740
they do is start to get in

294
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,930
contact with their followers or with their

295
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,839
acquaintances and they begin to tell them that in

296
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,089
order to  recover that account they will have

297
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:31,690
to make a payment of x number of

298
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,420
US dollars or in this case of

299
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,579
bitcoins or we have already encountered

300
00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:38,709
another type of crypto  neda and that they

301
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:41,290
are probably accessed well also

302
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,209
clearly they are going to keep not only

303
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:45,220
their payment information and their money

304
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,139
but on some occasions we have

305
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:48,820
already heard that customers come to us that

306
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,380
after having paid they have not

307
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,579
returned their account

308
00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:54,920
but  now we are going to see what is the

309
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,189
amount of sales that are being

310
00:12:58,189 --> 00:13:00,019
made of the different profiles in

311
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:03,709
the black market well we have done

312
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:06,319
some false negotiations with the

313
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:08,179
criminals there is a person in our

314
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:11,329
team who speaks Turkish and most

315
00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:13,489
of the attacks that we  They are coming

316
00:13:13,489 --> 00:13:16,189
and the extortions come from Turkey

317
00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:18,619
not only with the IPs but with the way of

318
00:13:18,619 --> 00:13:20,569
writing it can be seen through the

319
00:13:20,569 --> 00:13:22,449
linguistic analysis that they come from

320
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:26,569
profiles that their English is with

321
00:13:26,569 --> 00:13:28,910
Turkish inferences

322
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,500
what happens that

323
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,360
criminals contact new

324
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,910
victims  to be able to sell those accounts

325
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,590
that have been hacked, that is, on the one

326
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,750
hand, they are extorting the victim

327
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,190
so that they pay them to recover  the

328
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,320
account and on the other hand they are selling

329
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,500
the accounts because or trying to sell

330
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,730
the accounts to potential buyers who

331
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,630
clearly can also end up being

332
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,220
victims of phishing and hacking,

333
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,260
so when recovering the

334
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,660
hacked accounts we can see in the dm is that

335
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,090
the criminals have been crossing paths

336
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,950
In messages with other users they have

337
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:03,050
been negotiating prices which is

338
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,940
a one hundred percent marketing situation, it

339
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:08,090
is very curious that on some of the

340
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,380
occasions we have had the

341
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,210
possibility to write to them

342
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,880
sometimes through WhatsApp

343
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,530
through the messages that  more they

344
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:18,080
use American virtual telephone numbers

345
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,330
because it is very curious because

346
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,430
they tell us when we ask them today is

347
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,500
that you know that this account has been

348
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,510
reported to the security body of the

349
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,700
state of the specific area and that is

350
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,830
good because all your criminal activity is

351
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,200
going to  be investigated and they

352
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,790
answer us with a lot of hard face

353
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,810
they do not have any kind of fear and they

354
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,519
know  that they will not be able to do anything with

355
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:42,320
this type of crime with which

356
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,509
content that is important that it is known

357
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,250
that before starting a

358
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,410
criminal activity of this type this type of is already being

359
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:52,899
done, let's say that of

360
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:55,100
verification of what the legal situation is

361
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,399
to be able to do this type of

362
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:01,370
crime and now is how much we can

363
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,529
be buying these

364
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:05,180
instagram accounts or how much they are trying to

365
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,540
sell when an instagram account is sold

366
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,269
that the payment is almost always in

367
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:13,519
cents of bitcoins or in US dollars

368
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,500
, well, a profile  with 80

369
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,420
thousand followers they were selling it

370
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,509
to us at 70 dollars which is nothing a profile

371
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:22,069
with a million followers they

372
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:24,050
were selling it to us at 875

373
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:27,470
American dollars and a profile with 15

374
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,240
million followers at 13 thousand

375
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,240
American dollars this seems almost as if it

376
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,920
were a  offer not because if we compare

377
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,560
that of a million followers with that of

378
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,139
15 million followers, let's say that

379
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:41,839
we would not get the accounts but this is

380
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:42,870
the price

381
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,810
at  that right now the different accounts are being set

382
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,450
despite the

383
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,700
fact that the case of the payment is almost always

384
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,029
with bitcoins and we have found that by

385
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:56,250
tracking several of the

386
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,860
bitcoins wallets with which they were

387
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,200
extorting our clients and

388
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,610
were making the offer to  to be able to

389
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:05,460
make the payment because in one of them there were

390
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,710
1.5 million dollars in transactions

391
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:11,220
that is said soon but you have to see how

392
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,560
little it is costing them from

393
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,080
a technological point of view to put together a

394
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,690
small and brief infrastructure that

395
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:21,240
especially in what more  leveraged

396
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,720
is in the minimum inference of

397
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,790
social engineering that they are using and that they also

398
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,320
do not have to innovate in each attack

399
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,450
but it can really serve us for

400
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,540
practically all attacks

401
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,870
as they do profiling targeting good

402
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,230
because what we have been finding is

403
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,180
that their  infrastructure is very simple

404
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,250
that in most of the ips of

405
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,709
these criminals and the type of modus

406
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:49,050
operandi that are used  Ilizar comes

407
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,420
from Turkey, I already say that not only

408
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,459
because of the IPs analyzed but also because of

409
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:55,680
the way of writing even when

410
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,360
we have been having a conversation with

411
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,750
them and it is important to try to

412
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,180
contextualize that organized crime

413
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,429
has very long arms with which

414
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:09,089
the money that is  is obtaining from the

415
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:11,640
sale of these profiles and from the

416
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,740
extortion of these profiles, it serves

417
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,470
to finance and finance some

418
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,299
other criminal activities such

419
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:20,819
as terrorism, which is

420
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:24,449
also very important that this information is shared

421
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:26,669
because if we are

422
00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:28,470
giving in to extortion  As has

423
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:31,020
happened to us with some clients when

424
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,210
they give in, one of the things that is

425
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:36,270
explained to them is that you are committing a

426
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,940
crime and be careful because when

427
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,420
an investigation is carried out,

428
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,450
your payment will most likely appear

429
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:45,270
in that investigation in the case in

430
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,250
which it arrives.  at the hands of interpol or in the

431
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,970
case in which it reaches the hands of

432
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,170
europol it is increasing  In recent

433
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,910
months, this is something that is

434
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,070
absolutely going to increase now a few

435
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,750
weeks ago that it had slowed down and now it is

436
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,240
growing again and we

437
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,270
are finding cases in

438
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,730
which apart from doing this type

439
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,400
of action on some occasions  There

440
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,750
are photographs that are

441
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,970
succulent from the intimate or erotic point of view, they

442
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,070
begin to

443
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,200
extort them with these images that they

444
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,340
can find in their

445
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,240
direct or good messages and mainly in

446
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,370
your direct messages and on some other

447
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,770
occasions we are finding

448
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,690
something that calls us a lot.  Attention

449
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,330
is that part of the images

450
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:33,120
that have been found in direct messages

451
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,550
or in that person's own timeline are used

452
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:38,340
to register a profile in

453
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,520
only fans and anonymous users do not charge for subscribing to

454
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,690
those profiles.

455
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:48,230
they are

456
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,570
safer than public figures from

457
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,820
these attacks because you already know that

458
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,400
many times what is

459
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,680
listed the most  do not are the images of

460
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,660
public figures but are the

461
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,580
images in the videos of people who

462
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,200
are apparently doing a

463
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,060
super normal thing that is to be in front of a

464
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,860
computer working having a

465
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,870
conversation with someone and that these

466
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:11,000
images are being used or images

467
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,280
of a training  or images, for example, of

468
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,190
a couple or some friends, people who

469
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,290
are in bikinis, because everything that

470
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,970
can be used in different

471
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,880
aspects, as we could try to

472
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,820
avoid it, despite the fact that absolute security

473
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,550
of course does not exist but

474
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:31,400
good part of the work that  We could

475
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,740
do to avoid it is to activate the

476
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,960
double verification factor that from

477
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,160
my point of view should be

478
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,960
mandatory in all social networks

479
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,630
and in all systems sorry that we

480
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:44,060
can find communication on the

481
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,290
internet

482
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:47,510
obviously use

483
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:50,330
and passwords that are different in the

484
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,980
different services we have because

485
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:56,330
the main origin many times when

486
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:59,780
already  They are within the network itself many

487
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,940
times what we have to

488
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,250
do as authorship to be able to secure

489
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,770
the users' profile is to see

490
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:09,590
where they have obtained that password and

491
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:12,440
most of them were part

492
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,420
of databases that had been liquid

493
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,130
That is to say, they had already been published

494
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:19,100
in other places on the internet and that what

495
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,540
was happening at that

496
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,550
time was clearly that they had the

497
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,800
user on one side the password on the

498
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,920
other, which was probably the same

499
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,380
that had been leaked in another of the

500
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,090
different databases  of data that there was and

501
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:34,580
that they have tested has worked and

502
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,690
immediately they have gone forward

503
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:40,530
for us it would be very important that

504
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,500
a continuous search be made with

505
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,660
alerts this is part of the service we

506
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,900
do is the continuous search of

507
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,490
those credentials

508
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,590
emails usernames behind

509
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:55,500
series  of information from the different

510
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,510
users whether we are

511
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,670
public figures or if we are common characters

512
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,500
completely anonymous or if we are

513
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,240
companies that search for

514
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,640
information and request

515
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,830
their elimination on the internet,

516
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,230
of course, do not provide the

517
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:13,500
access data by message to anyone and do not open

518
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,260
links without making sure of the

519
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,630
origin of that link there is something  that

520
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,790
we always recommend we

521
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:23,000
have a collaboration with several

522
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,740
companies that have applications that are

523
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,900
password managers and with these

524
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,840
password managers what we teach

525
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,820
to the different teams of community

526
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,680
management or communication agencies

527
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,560
or even certain types of

528
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,110
companies is to be able  work with these

529
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,250
links

530
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,800
and with these passwords without the other

531
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,900
colleague seeing it in a way that I

532
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,190
share with any of the

533
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,680
colleagues that I have in the office but

534
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,890
I am sharing them, let's say that the

535
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:55,230
access token I am not sharing

536
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,600
all the information in plain text  but it

537
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,270
is something that customers in part of the

538
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,470
work we do with them d  e

539
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,480
securing the profiles we use

540
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,610
with them as this type of password managers,

541
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:08,520
now if we do not

542
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,350
do this, what consequences can we

543
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,840


544
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,730


545
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,200


546
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,660


547
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,490
find?  They have already

548
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:23,450
accessed our profile or without having accessed

549
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:27,030
we have had clients who were

550
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:30,060
replicating their accounts not only on

551
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,890
those platforms themselves, such

552
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,990
as instagram or twitter or tipton,

553
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:38,550
but what I said a few minutes ago they

554
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,920
choose all the information that they

555
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,870
find interesting both  of images or

556
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:46,110
videos and they replicate those profiles in only

557
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:49,440
fans then they begin to receive a

558
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,960
subscription and the users who are

559
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,060
victims of this impersonation are not

560
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,010
aware that it is happening

561
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,990
until someone in their environment or someone

562
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,630
who recognizes them tells them hey but you have

563
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,940
an account in only fans then we have

564
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,070
had to accompany  clients to the

565
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,350
police station so that they can

566
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,450
make a complaint about what is

567
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:12,000
happening to them, we can also be the victim

568
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,400
of extortion precisely because of what I

569
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,570
was explaining, they

570
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,720
can also try to access

571
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,610
our bank details or they can

572
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,649
even reveal secrets as part of

573
00:23:26,649 --> 00:23:29,090
the  extortion, that is, they

574
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,640
take a few photographs, they

575
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,130
make them public in another profile, but they

576
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,140
are photographs that were not in

577
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,580
our timeline but were in

578
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,900
our direct messages,

579
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,090
so they make them public, they tell them if

580
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:43,190
you do not want us to continue making

581
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:45,770
these images public, pay the amount that you

582
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:48,200
We are saying and we will release your account on the one

583
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,330
hand, that is, the one that we will

584
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,650
do and on the other hand we will also

585
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:53,480
delete from this profile that we

586
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,150
have created with your information as

587
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:59,120
you will see, the world is of

588
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,550
the black market is all good as a consequence for the

589
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,380
victims because in  some of them we

590
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,700
have found that their

591
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,770
device has been hijacked in or  Others who have

592
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:09,050
only lent them the profiles on social networks

593
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:11,390
on some other occasions who

594
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,040
have accessed their banking information and

595
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,900
who have begun to make charges on

596
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,320
different cards

597
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,539
that have demanded payment in exchange for being

598
00:24:19,539 --> 00:24:21,700
able to return the normality that they have

599
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,799
accessed these  intimate images that

600
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:25,570
are filtering that

601
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:28,509
private content among their environment that

602
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,100
have accessed other contact information

603
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,960
such as the postal address the

604
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,830
personal telephone number of the partner

605
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:38,440
of the children's family or that they are

606
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,480
being scammed are hacking them or are

607
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,809
starting to access the entire

608
00:24:43,809 --> 00:24:46,149
contact list that that person has in the

609
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:48,730
different social networks as

610
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,559
consequences from the most reputational point of view

611
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,899
would clearly be the

612
00:24:52,899 --> 00:24:54,850
loss of credibility in the face of the

613
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:56,559
audience because depending on the

614
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,409
time the profile is hacked and the

615
00:24:59,409 --> 00:25:01,450
information  who are publishing is going to

616
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,789
have a loss of followers can

617
00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:07,350
also of course be ten

618
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:10,330
panning your own profile after

619
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,039
suffering this hack and some clients

620
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:14,679
do not send them complaints saying

621
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,509
that after they have been hacked it

622
00:25:16,509 --> 00:25:18,820
seems that they are having a shadow bang

623
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:21,610
that we say that their account on the

624
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:24,959
social network is having a problem.

625
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:29,760
To say how visibility

626
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,740
and dissemination capacity are

627
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,630
reaching less people selling age

628
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:36,180
men are downloading official sources

629
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,800
directly in infernal they are

630
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,540
telling us that it is not a

631
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,850
direct consequence but what we

632
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:43,470
get from customers is  Yes, they

633
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:46,500
are having this type of problem, it is

634
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,390
like the algorithm is not designed

635
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,950
for that to happen because it is

636
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:52,710
understood that it is not a matter of

637
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,840
responsibility of the user himself but

638
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,260
the reality is that they report these

639
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,640
problems to us, so we can also

640
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,160
have problems  of personal

641
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,560
or labor relations we are going to put the case of

642
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,210
someone who has had a profile hacked

643
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:09,210
just to  Before launching a movie or with

644
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:11,040
a client with whom we have

645
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,690
been trying to recover the

646
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:15,840
account for more than six months and that client has

647
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,020
registered with the same username that he

648
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,030
used when he had another account and with

649
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,290
another email that also

650
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,610
He was linked

651
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,980
in a lot of haste and for different

652
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,380
reasons he has decided to register to

653
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,730
another profile, so good because now

654
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,950
instagram says that there cannot be two

655
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,840
profiles with the same user with

656
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,940
which it has no possibility of recovering

657
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,280
that previous profile and that is

658
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,110
generating a  labor problem because he

659
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:43,840
cannot publicize with the same level

660
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,750
of diffusion all the campaigns, all the

661
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,429
theatrical works and everything he was

662
00:26:48,429 --> 00:26:50,350
doing which is obviously the reason

663
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,690
why he has an Instagram profile

664
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:55,179
feet to make himself known I do not say anything

665
00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:56,950
when we speak  For example, stores

666
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:59,200
that are dedicated to social shopping and that

667
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,809
what they are doing is using

668
00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:04,570
their own instag account as a

669
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:07,630
sales channel  ram or on some occasions the

670
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:09,790
media that have hacked their

671
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:12,190
twitter account well this

672
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,320
can also have consequences from the

673
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,059
economic point of view as I was already

674
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:18,290
indicating why

675
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:20,510
good of course for the money that you

676
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,670
are giving to the criminal

677
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:25,130
because you can also  have some

678
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:26,810
occasions the loss of employment or the

679
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:29,630
loss of the withdrawal of brands

680
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,730
or sponsors because you can

681
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,260
have a loss of business as

682
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,850
indicated now with some of the

683
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:37,520
different online stores or on some

684
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,770
occasions you can also lose the

685
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:43,820
investment of a possible  business that you were going

686
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,640
to do and in addition to all this

687
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,420
generates two concepts one is the lost profit

688
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:54,620
is how much you are not paying for

689
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,390
what has happened to you and on the other hand is

690
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:58,970
the emerging cost how much money do

691
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:02,660
you have to invest to return again  to

692
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,910
have the normality of your activity

693
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:08,660
through the internet some real cases

694
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,860
because I believe that

695
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:14,130
this does not end  to get into the

696
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,470
head well and much less through the

697
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,510
emotional circuit until we are not seeing a

698
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:21,120
real case, for example one of our

699
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,850
clients who is Cayetana Guillén-Cuervo

700
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:26,040
Cayetana one Sunday morning received

701
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,809
a notification by direct message from

702
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:32,460
apparently a profile like  She said at the

703
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,559
beginning of Instagram that she was

704
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,360
telling her that she was violating

705
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,620
copyright rules,

706
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,280
well, she thought it was really

707
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,400


708
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,010
Instagram, click on that link and from there it was

709
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:47,010
unleashed because the whole hacking situation

710
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:48,929
that occurred, they also

711
00:28:48,929 --> 00:28:50,730
began to extort money.  send him

712
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,799
messages through whatsapp because he

713
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,290
had already linked the whatsapp phone number,

714
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,809
which is the phone number,

715
00:28:57,809 --> 00:29:00,120
with the account's own and from

716
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,850
then on he began to work with us

717
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,799
to recover the account and

718
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,020
secure it.

719
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,450
case for example the dossier castro

720
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:12,240
itziar castro who kidnapped his

721
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,220
instagram account and started

722
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,740
extorting it  so that he could pay and thus they

723
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,200
could be returned to him in both cases,

724
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,620
the two accounts could be recovered and it is not by chance

725
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,200
that it happened to two actresses it is because it

726
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,690
was like a trojan horse that first

727
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:30,000
enters through a profile accesses the

728
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,370
rest of the contacts  that he has in

729
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,870
direct messages with these other

730
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:37,200
profiles and begins to spread through

731
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,510
the different audiences that have

732
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,790
another person who was also a victim who

733
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,520
is also a client who is eva isanta

734
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,670
another actress who had his account hacked and

735
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,800
who very kindly also

736
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,770
thanked us and  that one of the things that

737
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:55,070
had happened is that in this case he

738
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:59,040
was receiving a

739
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,350
direct message in which it also seemed that they

740
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:03,870
were telling him that he was infringing

741
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:06,610
copyright rules,

742
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:08,140
which is what we also find

743
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,420
that not only affects that sector in

744
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,950
concrete of the people who are better

745
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:14,620
known as people who are actors

746
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,210
and actresses of the first line but

747
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:17,830
also for example paula fernández

748
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:20,890
ochoa qu  e apart from being a lawyer, she is the

749
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:23,559
physical trainer of different top-

750
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:27,549
of-the-line athletes because she

751
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:29,770
found that a direct message was reaching her

752
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:32,650
in which it seemed that she

753
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:34,540
was violating certain rules

754
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:37,090
when she clicked on this link,

755
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:39,280
everything started happening to you.  I have

756
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,830
been explaining previously in the

757
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:44,519
case of Paula she also began to receive,

758
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:47,909
let's say, a lot of impact

759
00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:49,529
from her audience because they were

760
00:30:49,529 --> 00:30:51,690
changing her photographs and they were

761
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,580
changing the name of the account I am going to

762
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:56,399
say a trick is very important and it is

763
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,759
that we should all have

764
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:03,239
basic information stored so that in

765
00:31:03,239 --> 00:31:04,559
the hypothetical case in which

766
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,959
the impact is not looted, the

767
00:31:06,959 --> 00:31:08,609
first thing is the idea of the profile user,

768
00:31:08,609 --> 00:31:10,889
evidently with which the

769
00:31:10,889 --> 00:31:12,690
email we have registered

770
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,249
with the number of  phone we have it

771
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:15,629
linked what are our

772
00:31:15,629 --> 00:31:17,850
verifications

773
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:19,950
because we are through duo we are

774
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,590
through google au  tentica aitor

775
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,910
we would also have to know which are

776
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:25,559
the ips with which

777
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:28,890
we are normally accessing the most, having

778
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:31,950
the account hacking form pre-filled

779
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:34,860
and other information that

780
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,480
in the case of being a company we

781
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,370
should have such as deeds

782
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,530
and another series  of information and this

783
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:41,760
we would always have to have

784
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,090
stored our

785
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:45,990
professional recommendation would be that it be in a

786
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:47,940
password manager that

787
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,580
could also have managed certain

788
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:53,400
information in folders that are not

789
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,620
only figures but saved with a

790
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,240
password and with a double verification factor it

791
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,549
also happened  to another

792
00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:01,530
client Eduardo Casanova was a good

793
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:04,190
client after the hack

794
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:06,350
in this case apart he began to receive

795
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,909
another type of attack that was the

796
00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:10,429
calendar attack that this could be discussed on

797
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:12,889
another occasion by means of which they had

798
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,169
subscribed him with the same email

799
00:32:15,169 --> 00:32:17,539
that he had  they had hacked the account to a

800
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:19,850
series of calendars and that they ended

801
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:22,370
up  receiving notifications

802
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:24,590
of security breaches and other types

803
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,899
of issues and this also

804
00:32:26,899 --> 00:32:29,539
happened to him, exit ar with which a

805
00:32:29,539 --> 00:32:32,029
lot has to do not only the hacking

806
00:32:32,029 --> 00:32:34,879
but then they try to try

807
00:32:34,879 --> 00:32:38,240
to see how this information can be profitable.

808
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,840
They have already obtained

809
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,159
some solutions and are now over

810
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:44,299
because our time is running out,

811
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:47,059
as some of the solutions we

812
00:32:47,059 --> 00:32:50,410
can have are the following:

813
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:53,400
help with the hacking of this account

814
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,990
helps with the complaint process

815
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:57,970
because I have not said this but  It is vital that

816
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:00,490
there are as many complaints as possible of

817
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,410
this type of situation because it is

818
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:04,900
clear that the state security forces will

819
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,290
not be able to have

820
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:10,390
sufficient resources both on a human,

821
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,830
technological and economic level

822
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:16,080
if there is not a volume of complaints  that

823
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,550
visually and statistically makes

824
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,830
it worthwhile to have your own unit,

825
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:23,080
for example in Chile within the

826
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,300
pda and you have a unit  d that it is very good

827
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,670
that it is for everything that has to

828
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:29,770
do with cybercrimes good because it is very

829
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:32,920
important that these situations can be reported

830
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,350
because also in the

831
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:38,110
recovery process the complaint itself helps us

832
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:40,570
to recover the normality

833
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:42,070
of that account

834
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,510
then we help the  clients to

835
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:45,820
secure that account and then we

836
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,650
help them gain privacy,

837
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,990
a whole tracking and audit of

838
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:52,330
the digital identity of those people

839
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,760
or companies is carried out, whether they are

840
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,230
public figures or if they are

841
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:56,950
absolute

842
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:00,340
anonymous citizens, to be able to see all

843
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,409
those  information on where it has been able to

844
00:34:02,409 --> 00:34:04,480
end up and what has been the origin of the

845
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,700
attempt to access their social accounts

846
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,969
and people who are

847
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:11,469
public figures are helped to

848
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:14,260
verify their profile that, let's say, in

849
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,940
order to recover a profile in

850
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:19,149
many  Sometimes it is much easier

851
00:34:19,149 --> 00:34:20,949
to get your account back if your

852
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:22,989
account has been previously verified

853
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:24,460
and has been  or a work of

854
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:27,070
anti-hacking preparation

855
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:29,260
because for my part I have to

856
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,899
thank you for this little while that we have been able to

857
00:34:31,899 --> 00:34:33,940
be here and left the microphone open

858
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:37,599
to be able to ask questions, queries, complaints,

859
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,550
suggestions what

860
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:42,800
each one of you considers,

861
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,560
thank you very much jungle the truth that

862
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,570
The talk was very informative, the

863
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:49,730
truth is that I think that many times those of

864
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:51,650
us who are more technical and work more

865
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:53,659
in the world of cybersecurity

866
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:55,250
know this whole area so it is

867
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,929
really very interesting and there are many

868
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:59,290
questions,

869
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,940
some related to Chile, but I will

870
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,160
try to  To do as much as possible, for

871
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,450
example, was starting with one of the

872
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:07,850
last question from barberà that

873
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:10,520
asked if it was possible to legislate

874
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,670
on identity theft,

875
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:17,000
if it is possible to legislate, it is necessary to

876
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,680
differentiate between

877
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,390
identity theft and

878
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:22,400
identity theft.  Identity

879
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,440
generally occurs in situations in

880
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,140
which not only that own profile is being used

881
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,849
but also t  There are also many other

882
00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:31,640
aspects of the

883
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,460
person's analog identity and it is also important to see if

884
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,140
the technical identity is being used,

885
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,210
that is, if, for example, they are using

886
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,609
our machine or our connections

887
00:35:40,609 --> 00:35:43,819
to be able to make a false access to

888
00:35:43,819 --> 00:35:46,880
certain services, but Enrique is

889
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,740
so  It can legislate and in fact in

890
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,390
our country for example it is legislated

891
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:54,020
and andorra normally uses

892
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,240
practically the same penal code that

893
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,160
is being used in Spain there are many

894
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,829
countries that are copying it we are

895
00:36:00,829 --> 00:36:02,359
going behind France for example

896
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:03,799
Germany and I suppose this goes a bit

897
00:36:03,799 --> 00:36:05,660
So in a cascade,

898
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,490
here is another question according to the

899
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,440
current legislation

900
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,190
in Spain they say there is not much that can

901
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:15,079
be done positively against

902
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:17,030
those who negotiate this type of accounts, I

903
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,859
imagine I to their plantation and that type of

904
00:36:18,859 --> 00:36:23,150
thing is so or it is and if  It does not depend on

905
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:26,089
what capacity to identify the

906
00:36:26,089 --> 00:36:28,309
technical identity can be obtained,

907
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:30,559
that is, we one of the services  What

908
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:33,319
else we do is always with the work of

909
00:36:33,319 --> 00:36:35,450
the private detective behind

910
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:37,010
this is mandatory and with the

911
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:38,869
knowledge of the police force, beacons are

912
00:36:38,869 --> 00:36:40,819
made, for example in

913
00:36:40,819 --> 00:36:42,920
situations especially of harassment in

914
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,200
which we are now encountering a

915
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,289
very hard case that is a family  that he has

916
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,690
lost his daughter and that he is

917
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,400
lying down to the profiles of the

918
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,530
deceased daughter through different

919
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:57,079
social networks that this has a tendency

920
00:36:57,079 --> 00:36:58,549
that has already been given a name for

921
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,130
years that extension of the wing how they

922
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:02,930
are laughing at the person  who has

923
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:05,289
died then to be able to

924
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:07,880
identify which are the identities

925
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,160
behind many times the only

926
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,000
way

927
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,860
that is congruent and that is proportional

928
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,740
and that is the appropriate way to

929
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:17,150
achieve it is not through

930
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:19,310
intelligent opensource because that person who

931
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:20,930
is doing it is trying to

932
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:23,090
anonymize the maximum possible with which

933
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:25,400
it makes a beacon of this account

934
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,170
and tries to obtain the

935
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:29,000
technical identity that has  And behind with that

936
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,880
information plus with the

937
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:35,480
pertinent complaint to the court on duty or in

938
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,040
some occasions when they are minors of the

939
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,560
prosecution data, all that

940
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,620
information can be obtained is provided to them and there

941
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:45,680
a court order is made by the judge

942
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,110
to the company, then yes  It is

943
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,940
facebook twitter instagram web

944
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:53,900
victor whatever it is so that they can try

945
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:57,170
to contribute what the ips were,

946
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:59,900
well, all the string of

947
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,240
fingerprinting and the most important thing that

948
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,240
then the internet service provider can be officiated to the company

949
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,460
so that it can

950
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:10,090
give data of the connections  that there was

951
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:12,590
obviously when it is something that is

952
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,600
professionalized in fact it became very

953
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,820
public that there were several companies in

954
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,710
Latin America such as

955
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:21,530
there are 320 urdón there is stream that they were carrying

956
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:23,349
out smear campaigns

957
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:25,849
orchestrated to be able to attack against

958
00:38:25,849 --> 00:38:27,980
different political leaders or against

959
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:30,410
different companies when in that

960
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,900
case  you have to do another type of

961
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:36,320
research much more advanced that

962
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,560
also does it  We can, but

963
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:43,190
technically, another thing is that they have not

964
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:46,550
left any type of mistake or that

965
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,720
there has not been any type of

966
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,210
human error that with which it ends up

967
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:51,859
delaying in time as it has

968
00:38:51,859 --> 00:38:53,599
happened to us in some case for five years

969
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,599
but the legislation  Yes, he does contemplate it,

970
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:58,910
what happens is that many times and I say

971
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:02,150
a very clear case if the IPC is, for

972
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,980
example, they end up showing that they are all

973
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:06,960
from Panama Panama tells you like this

974
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,630
and does not answer you or if you have the bad

975
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,790
luck that you have bought the mail  Or with

976
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:14,510
others that I will not say with telegram,

977
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,700
look there is another question that says at the level

978
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,710
of legislation, the budapest agreement

979
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:21,020
has contributed to the actions of the police

980
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,790
to prosecute this type of actions or

981
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,230
not

982
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,930
and it depends on each country

983
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:29,309
I insist that it depends on the

984
00:39:29,309 --> 00:39:31,829
international treaties that exist between the

985
00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:33,539
different countries, for example Andorran

986
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:36,119
has an international treaty with the United States and

987
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:37,470
when they encounter a

988
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:39,450
problem such as

989
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:41,160
something that is happening  Through

990
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,960
instagram or through facebook or

991
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,210
through whatsapp because it is

992
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:48,900
complicated, okay, here is another

993
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,890
question

994
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,319
also good knowing that there are

995
00:39:54,319 --> 00:39:56,119
legal experts in the area of security xi,

996
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:58,940
the question is there are also these

997
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:02,030
prepared on these issues and both  I had the

998
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:04,549
great luck of being

999
00:40:04,549 --> 00:40:07,700
able to do class two weeks ago because every year

1000
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,380
we do classes at the herald contribution

1001
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,420
the judiciary so there are prosecutors

1002
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,859
who are specialized in

1003
00:40:12,859 --> 00:40:15,140
technological crimes who are very good here

1004
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,119
we have one Roberto Valverde who is a

1005
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,640
machine or we have Bermúdez who  It is another

machine or it is not the same there are many

1007
00:40:21,859 --> 00:40:25,760
people now the issue is

1008
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,560
when one is going to initiate a

1009
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,380
judicial process or first a police process

1010
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,630
so that it ends in a judicial process it does not

1011
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,880
have to have even the slightest failure you

1012
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,230
cannot present a screenshot

1013
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:39,470
to  The crazy thing has to be done well, the

1014
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,290
digital certification and very important

1015
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:44,870
how it is explained to the judges for me

1016
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:48,200
is  vital the staging that he does is

1017
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,090
the moment when you go to the trial was

1018
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:51,740
a person who is sixty-some

1019
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,140
years old you cannot talk to him about

1020
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,910
ips and you can talk to them about

1021
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,680
technical identities can look what you

1022
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,690
are telling me but there is  to do it

1023
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:02,180
even with drawings without

1024
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,540
disrespecting them

1025
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:07,089
here ends one related to facebook and

1026
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:09,160
foot and who wants the moment he

1027
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,569
was talking about facebook says

1028
00:41:10,569 --> 00:41:12,430
facebook cannot analyze that type of

1029
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:15,910
links or suspicious thematic leagues I

1030
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:16,599
think so it

1031
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:19,240
probably depends on one  I

1032
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,829
ask facebook facebook for little it can

1033
00:41:20,829 --> 00:41:22,289
deliver all the user's information,

1034
00:41:22,289 --> 00:41:25,000
especially identity unless there is

1035
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,400
a court order, be you,

1036
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,460
I like that a lot because it opens up there me the

1037
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:33,609
very fat the first is I know that in

1038

cases in which it has  there has been a

[Music]

1040
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:41,710
a firm suspicion of risk to the

1041
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,210
life of a person

1042
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:45,790
facebook has delivered an immense file

1043
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:48,819
of information from that profile to the

1044
00:41:48,819 --> 00:41:50,800
police force comp  Etente of the area so that they

1045
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,420
identify their user and try

1046
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:55,150
to prevent suicide now I say if

1047
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:58,150
this is obtained it can also be used

1048
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:00,040
for other cases such as

1049
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,099
harassment such as harassment that are repeated

1050
00:42:03,099 --> 00:42:09,130
but there we enter into a struggle with something

1051
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:11,410
that  For them in the United States it is vital that it is

1052
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:12,579
the issue of freedom of expression,

1053
00:42:12,579 --> 00:42:14,890
so we enter into the conflict between

1054
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:17,200
freedom of expression or not and then something

1055
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,670
else and that is that I believe that these

1056
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:21,369
social platforms that

1057
00:42:21,369 --> 00:42:23,650
we all work on are very

1058
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:26,140
good.  monetizing our data and not

1059
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:28,869
so good we are going to put it like this

1060
00:42:28,869 --> 00:42:31,420
by responding to the problems that are

1061
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:34,470
caused to us in these networks both at a

1062
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:37,809
business level and at an emotional and

1063
00:42:37,809 --> 00:42:40,490
personal level then they

1064
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:42,260
can have that data they

1065
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,940
have that data another thing is how

1066
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:46,040
they are used  but I have to say for their

1067
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,840
benefit that there are very

1068
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,450
good people working on the platforms, which

1069
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:52,160
in fact consists of a very good friend

1070
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,270
who works in  the area of minors

1071
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,700
precisely all the monitoring that is

1072
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,250
done to blooming sexting etc.

1073
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:00,410
but unfortunately and probably

1074
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:02,030
because that is the way it has to be, there are also

1075
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:03,920
many protocols to be able to deliver

1076
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,710
certain information or not or it is

1077
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:07,610
probably in the case of harassment

1078
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:09,440
while it is not really achieved

1079
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,000
check that the person they are

1080
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,920
harassing has a risk of life

1081
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,540
probably facebook does not deliver

1082
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:17,500
the information and the same career

1083
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,940
would be nice if artificial intelligence was applied a little

1084
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,160
to be able to

1085
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,220
prevent this type of behavior ok

1086
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,720
to freedom of expression but i

1087
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,950
Telling you are ruining

1088
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:30,380
someone's life and they have made you 500 complaints

1089
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:33,470
can be a trick when they see a profile

1090
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:36,170
that is harassing them that they do not all go in a

1091
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:38,810
herd because if it does not fall to the same

1092
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:41,180
person that we say is the moderator

1093
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:42,980
you have to go waiting and  You have to

1094
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,349


1095
00:43:44,349 --> 00:43:47,229
wait in time and also change the

1096
00:43:47,229 --> 00:43:49,839
device and IP to attack the property itself.

1097
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:52,059
or profile because if the same corrector does not arrive

1098
00:43:52,059 --> 00:43:55,140
and it no longer works, of course,

1099

excellent, throw the jungle, thank you very much

1100

, there were many more questions

1101
00:43:59,769 --> 00:44:01,059
but unfortunately for time we

1102
00:44:01,059 --> 00:44:02,769
cannot do it so it was an

1103
00:44:02,769 --> 00:44:03,849
incredible experience for us to

1104
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:06,670
have had your talk and

1105
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:08,920

thanks and good to the audience you

1113
