1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,360
I like it

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,170
well

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:17,599
[Music]

4
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:36,309
[Music]

5
00:00:42,820 --> 00:01:02,210
[Music]

6
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:26,580
we are back

7
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,289
as I told you in a few minutes

8
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:30,810
we were going back and the truth is that for me

9
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,710
now it is an honor and a pleasure to

10
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,420
finish the morning session, so to speak,

11
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,670
although we continue  long so

12
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,100
bring your pizza your beer whatever it

13
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,750
is here to the computer because we don't stop

14
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,730
until the end of the conference

15
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,520
I'm with santiago lopez and as i

16
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,040
told him he tried to look for weakness

17
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,870
but santiago lopez better known as

18
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,630
bad luck antonio also told me  He is

19
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,580
a really old school hacker,

20
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,220
that is, we have the honor and pleasure of the

21
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,750
fact that you look for Santiago yourself,

22
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,880
you will not find him, so you are there,

23
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,440
I really appreciate your

24
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,500
time or support, you can share your

25
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,020
great experience with us and  as I

26
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,210
could not find you yourself, I will have to

27
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,160
introduce you, thank you very much for being with

28
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,200
us, our solidarity 8,

29
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,370
thank you very much for your

30
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,350
involvement, it is a pleasure to be

31
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,180
with you.  us and also supporting a cause of

32
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,020
solidarity as it is fine because as

33
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,900
you said I am simply dedicated to

34
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,240
security issues I am not a person

35
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,800
who is too neat on

36
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,320
social networks yes I have but I try to keep my

37
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,670
profile low it is only for

38
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:43,390
close people and not  I am in favor of

39
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,220
publishing no personal information,

40
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,700
no information that can reveal

41
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,170
political ideology,

42
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,210
religious feelings, feelings, football,

43
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,370
nothing, because in the end you never know

44
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,280
when that could turn against you,

45
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,820
so well, welcome to

46
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,550
Santiago, thank you very much, thank you,

47
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:06,850
thank you, well share

48
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,330
Yes, the screen is right. My talk today will be

49
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,640
about bitcoin and about blogs.

50
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,960


51
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,990


52
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,540


53
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,270


54
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,060


55
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,350
what are

56
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,820
honest cryptome let's see some

57
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,070
headlines where  we are going to see how

58
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,890
these things are treated we are going to see

59
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:40,000
why I consider together with some

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,580
other people that the blog can be the

61
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,500
beginning of an important change within the

62
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,870
internet we are going to see what a blog is

63
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,060
in a bit how it works what

64
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,890
It has characteristics and we are going to

65
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,600
see the functionalities that are less

66
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,700
known of the sein bloc, which are

67
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,010
smart contracts,

68
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,200
ok then well,

69
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,050
without further ado, let's start if you

70
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,000
think we are going to see what a crypt is,

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,280
a Christ coins as its own

72
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,580
name indicates  is a is a currency that

73
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,069
is not real it is a currency that only exists

74
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:14,069
on the internet and that may

75
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:18,029
arise with the idea of trying to

76
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:21,358
facilitate or create an

77
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,340
exchange system that would be completely

78
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:29,669
agnostic of countries of economies and

79
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:32,460
other things that are  It could be used

80
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,560
anywhere in the world and that it was

81
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,800
always a currency that was on the

82
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,010
network for its on the other hand that

83
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,360
characterizes the crypts ways that

84
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,450
evidently  entity against the currency

85
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,060
of a country, a crypto currency does not have

86
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,729
any type of support, that is, there is

87
00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:52,800
no one who supports the value of that

88
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,810
crypto, therefore no bank,

89
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,210
no country can determine what the

90
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,600
real cost of the crypto currency is.  It

91
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,450
makes its entire operation based on

92
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:06,060
something as cruel on some occasions

93
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,000
as the value of the value of supply

94
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,789
and demand, that is, the more supply

95
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:14,280
there is or how much more demand there is, the more the

96
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,620
price of bitcoin rises, which we have seen

97
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,539
ago.  not for a long time or from

98
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:20,580
crypts in general, something that we have seen

99
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,020
action for a long time that

100
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,850
bitcoin was above 50 thousand

101
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,280
dollars and now it is at 20 thousand then it

102
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,460
is highly volatile and I think that

103
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,320
about a year ago something like that was in  three

104
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,660
thousand in three thousand dollars then it is one

105
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,750
is a very volatile thing

106
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,090
and what is certain is that crypto

107
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:40,280
currencies like bitcoin seriously and others

108
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,500
are all based on block

109
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,760
change technology that is to say all the  crypto currencies

110
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,290
belong to a block change but not

111
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,420
everything that is in a block is crypto

112
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,800
currencies there are more things that is what we are

113
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,740
going to see in this talk to see what

114
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,730
little things it provides you also good because

115
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,200
a crypt way that we need to

116
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,390
use it obviously and  fundamentally we

117
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,130
need an internet connection if

118
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,170
there is no internet connection we cannot

119
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:09,080
use a crypt from there

120
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,850
when we want to make a transaction we

121
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,880
need to know who we are going to

122
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,580
send it to and if we are going to receive money from

123
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,470
where are we going to receive these

124
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,200
addresses from  Sending and receiving

125
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,310
make up what is called a

126
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:27,080
crypto wallet, this is the same

127
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,550
as this way, they are still a

128
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,800
kind of wallet that can be

129
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,140
located in different places.

130
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:36,710


131
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,990
our

132
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,000
team by installing a

133
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,689
software such as

134
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:44,819
the electron for example that is a

135
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:47,399
bitcoin client in such a way that

136
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:49,019
we install that client is the

137
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:52,919
client generates an electronic wallet

138
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:55,529
an encrypted file in our computer

139
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:58,649
in which we are going to receive the bitcoins

140
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:00,629
we are going to be able to send green bitcoins'

141
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,479
from that wallet then there is another type

142
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:05,519
of work today another way of working

143
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:07,739
with wallet that  They are the remote

144
00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:09,989
ones that are usually used

145
00:07:09,989 --> 00:07:14,879
by de de Cristo 'traders' coins or

146
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,229
remote payment systems there are

147
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:18,389
platforms where you can let yourself

148
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:20,550
register with a user and a

149
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,969
password and enter your money there

150
00:07:23,969 --> 00:07:26,729
to convert it into crypto currency  But

151
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:29,279
the physical file where

152
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,229
that information is stored

153
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:34,469
always remains on the service provider's server,

154
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:36,659
each one has its advantages

155
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:38,099
and

156
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:39,599
disadvantages.The advantage of having it locally

157
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,149
is obviously safer,

158
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:44,819
that is, we are going to have our file.

159
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:47,380
to have us guarded

160
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,540
in a usb that can be encrypted with

161
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,710
a password and can also be

162
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,890
protected  In a safe in front of a

163
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,610
[Music] the

164
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,530
same is an earthquake that will

165
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,199
always be located on the server of a

166
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:05,789
Christ management platform. '

167
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:07,719
Obviously, if we lose the file,

168
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:10,840
we lose the usb and others if we have not

169
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,610
been careful to save our files.

170
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,879
Words that make up the

171
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,990
possibility of recovery

172
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,080
are normally about 12 random words and that

173
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,580
would give us the possibility of recovering

174
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,469
that wallet on any other

175
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:25,569
computer if we physically lose the

176
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:28,180
file and do not have that information if,

177
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,500
for example, a large software attacks us and

178
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,180
We lose and encrypt the information on the

179
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,370
disk because obviously we have lost

180
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,690
all the cryptos coins that we had

181
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:38,078
this happened to someone who threw a

182
00:08:38,078 --> 00:08:39,909
computer in the trash a few years ago

183
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:42,789
because it was an old laptop and it turns out that

184
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:43,990
there was a walid with a few

185
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,910
bitcoins and  is now offering

186
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,780
a rather generous reward for

187
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,550
helping him search the mountains of

188
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,640
garbage to see if  I found the one on the

189
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,580
computer in the case of the remote one because

190
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,720
obviously it will always be

191
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,090
accessible from anywhere, it will be

192
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:05,120
to view backup copies but it

193
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,040
has a small weakness that is that

194
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,510
some attack of this style has already occurred

195
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,880
and that is, in the case  of an attack on the

196
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,010
platform if they manage to violate the

197
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,140
platform, they could obviously have

198
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,740
access to which users and

199
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,620
could extract all that money from

200
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,660
all those crypto ways of the valet and

201
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,820
transfer it to other accounts so that

202
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,400
we can see a little above what a

203
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,800
wallet wallet is this this is a ballet

204
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,290
created with electron and we have a series

205
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:36,790
of very strange reception addresses

206
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,020
any shipment that is made to any

207
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,940
of these addresses would arrive at this

208
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,280
same address and we can send from

209
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,730
any of the addresses that

210
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,290
are marked in yellow  in such a way

211
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,300
that we have multiple

212
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,060
input addresses multiple addresses

213
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,979
to make it difficult to trace

214
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,350
the pr  On the contrary, since we have said that it was

215
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,820
that to try to make the transactions

216
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,040
simple and that they were

217
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,080
globally it is very easy to pay with Christ

218
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,840
coins although each time depending on the

219
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,390
time of the people I do not know if the year

220
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,390
but it depends on the country at the time

221
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,280
The political moment of many of

222
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,690
certain things may be

223
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,770
complicated in China now it is

224
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,330
practically impossible to pay with Christ

225
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:21,360
ways but if it allows us to put, I will

226
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,770
make payments anywhere

227
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,930
globally and from and without any problem with

228
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,540
a certain immediacy it allows us

229
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,160
Eliminate intermediaries that is, we

230
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,500
remove the concorde in the middle with

231
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,900
which the commissions of that

232
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,090
type end if it is true that through when

233
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,560
you make a payment through cryptocurrency networks in

234
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,200
the end you will

235
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,240
always end up paying a part as well  of

236
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,070


237
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,870
commission transactions say that they are anonymous

238
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,640
or that is what many people think

239
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,400
but not only are they so much they are not so much

240
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,130
we will see what  and

241
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:56,940
recently there was an attack on the colonial oil company

242
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,460
in the United States by a team

243
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,160
of hackers called dark side

244
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,840
who asked for a ransomware attack,

245
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,430
asked for an attack or

246
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:09,000
asked for a ransom from 75 bitcoins to

247
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,190
the company, the company paid them  To

248
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:14,180
recover the information

249
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,960
and the research base, it has been possible

250
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,390
to recover about 64 bit

251
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,700
coins, with which we are seeing that

252
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,890
they are not so intractable either and then

253
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,839
we will see it in more detail, it also

254
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,610
provides

255
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,410
network users with the

256
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,240
option as interesting things  mining, that is, the option of

257
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,970
putting my computer to work

258
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,730
and generating money in some way, this

259
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:41,070
in the beginning was very simple, but the

260
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,410
structure of blog networks

261
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,180
usually means that the script or

262
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,430
coins do that the more  time passes

263
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:50,010
more time more time and more computation you

264
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:53,310
need to process and to generate

265
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,769
a new currency that you because it can

266
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:58,079
bring you a profit then for this

267
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,910
it is  It works with mining polish

268
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,800
graphics cards and now the

269
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,959
electricity consumption is so high that perhaps

270
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,699
what this economic return achieves by

271
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:07,970
doing this

272
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,399
is much less than what you have spent on

273
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,920
electrical investment and on good hardware and

274
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,149
then because the banks are not

275
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:15,470
using it as well.  within their

276
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:18,350
portfolios as a

277
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,720
better investment asset because within

278
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,699
the risk products that they have they

279
00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:26,250
have investments in cryptocurrencies

280
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,740
because crypto and bitcoin have such a bad reputation

281
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,960
and these things,

282
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,410
obviously because it has always been the

283
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,480
standard or preferred format for

284
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,630
cybercriminals to

285
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,330
collect their blackmail in the case

286
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,950
of ransomware attacks that this is

287
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,860
a real kidnapping and I also say that it is

288
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,570
real because they behave exactly that

289
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,580
I do not know it costs exactly the same as a

290
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,920
hijacker  real they encrypt all

291
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,380
the information on the disk and when you and

292
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,750
have the address where you have to

293
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,230
do the  I pay that it is a bitcoin wallet,

294
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,690
well they behave

295
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:04,920
exactly the same as the kidnappers

296
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,360
and I say this because it has touched me sometime

297
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,330
and it is that they allow you to ask for

298
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,340
proof of life when they kidnap

299
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,900
someone in the movies, the typical thing is

300
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,610
that already  But tell me, show me, let me

301
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,900
talk to him to know that he is fine,

302
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,820
because here they do the same they tell you,

303
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,910
send me three files, the encryption of the ones

304
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,860
you have on your disk that I

305
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,630
will return them from decryption so you can see

306
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,340
that I do have the password

307
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,020
then  they act exactly like

308
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,210
the kidnappers in life in the

309
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,070
physical environment in real life

310
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,500
and then there is the scam part that is

311
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,480
another part that is very fashionable

312
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,490
has had a season that was

313
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:42,960
more down there was not so much spam but it has

314
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,030
It has come back lately that are the

315
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:48,240
emails that come to your

316
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,240
mailbox saying how good it is a

317
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,430
hacker who has been monitoring your

318
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:56,160
computer for months that has managed to record in

319
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,430
video  deo while you are watching pornography

320
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,350
on the internet that you have

321
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,790
strange tastes and that also as you have had

322
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,970
access to your contact list if

323
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,360
you do not want me to make those videos public to

324
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,850
your contacts then obviously pay

325
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:15,180
an amount of money x in bitcoin to a

326
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,630
water that you  Obviously send this is

327
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:21,240
a fake normally there is no one there

328
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,040
is no hacker who in the end

329
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,680
has really managed to access your computer and

330
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,990
this is a scam because there really

331
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,850
is nothing to say the first time it

332
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,890
comes this gave me a fit of laughter but

333
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,350
well

334
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,160
what does the press say well there are many it

335
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,870
depends on the moment there are many times

336
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,720
that things vary greatly there is

337
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,060
regulatory uncertainty the states

338
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:47,730
govern it they do not know how to treat this

339
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:50,279
for the clients there is

340
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:52,440
fear of theft theft what we were talking about

341
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,760
which are hosted on

342
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,699
remote servers is that if that server is

343
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:59,370
violated then automatically all the

344
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,829
ballets that are there are robbed  [ __ ] and

345
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:05,250
that causes the prestige of that network or

346
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,570
that crypt currency to fall and its value falls in

347
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,790
electricity consumption because of course there are

348
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,950
people there are areas where

349
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,830
the issue of finished is no longer allowed because because the

350
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,720
mineral mined from Victor in the end

351
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,170
supposes  A real problem for the

352
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,300
electricity grid, on the other hand, is the tax part,

353
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,040
that is, governments

354
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,410
want to collect taxes for the

355
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,450
benefits that people obtain, but if

356
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:32,210
this is all in virtual platforms

357
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:34,490
where governments do not have access, it is not

358
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,470
difficult for them then they are already

359
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,200
trying to legislate  and control who

360
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,730
invests in crypto currencies to

361
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,160
limit it right

362
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,560
now there are more than a lot of this

363
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,019
presentation there were 1600 currencies now

364
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:52,810
we are above 4000 and it is true

365
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,160
that many of them will not survive

366
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,920
so you invest in a

367
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,170
way that  Better in three months it has

368
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,149
risen a lot and the following month it has

369
00:16:01,149 --> 00:16:04,060
disappeared and well then there are

370
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,740
possible manipulations and then

371
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,189
manipulation  There are ions of the technological type

372
00:16:08,189 --> 00:16:11,350
in quotation marks and then there are those that are

373
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:15,069
at the communication level that we have

374
00:16:15,069 --> 00:16:16,990
our friend of the most that every time

375
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,480
he speaks and produces each time he speaks

376
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,069
in a way produces a

377
00:16:21,069 --> 00:16:24,220
brutal effect then when he left talking about

378
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,500
the  coin people started investing

379
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,079
locally then they said they were going to stop an

380
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:31,959
ad that tesla was no longer going to allow

381
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:34,149
their cars to be paid with bitcoin

382
00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:36,699
bitcoin sank then soon after they

383
00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:38,230
said no good i am thinking

384
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,449
maybe we will continue  that we are going to continue to

385
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:42,490
admit bitcoin with which

386
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,829
bitcoin rose again and in the end

387
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:46,630
then bitcoins lipton also collapses

388
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,460
because china is limiting

389
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:52,150
both the access eliminated from christ '

390
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:56,770
ways as well as the payment and the use of

391
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:59,710
them so it is all very complicated

392
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,930
and more things that can be done, not

393
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,910
only that is to say, we must keep in mind

394
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,200
that there are many more things that we can

395
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,440
do, we can do electronic voting,

396
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,150
banks are seeing that  They bet a lot

397
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,700
on blogs sein because because it

398
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,670
helps them to reduce and simplify the

399
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:18,910
processes and guarantee the traceability

400
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:21,060
of all the actions that are carried out,

401
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,800
we will see later a particular case

402
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,380
of Carrefour, which is a

403
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:30,310
French supermarket chain that implemented

404
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,820
a block change technology  for a

405
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,440
particular issue and is extending it

406
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,550
for the control and management of the

407
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:42,490
distribution of internal products, now

408
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,530
it has also become very fashionable to be

409
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,470
able to protect the copyright of

410
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:49,030
electronic works we will also

411
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,740
see later and then well, the

412
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,380
investments in  The block change that they are

413
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,669
uploading

414
00:17:54,669 --> 00:17:56,769
effectively say that there are people who are already

415
00:17:56,769 --> 00:17:59,039
saying that the use of blogs in

416
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,629
standish disruptive such as

417
00:18:01,629 --> 00:18:03,369
mobile phones,

418
00:18:03,369 --> 00:18:05,409
this can have a lot of impact, I am

419
00:18:05,409 --> 00:18:07,539
convinced that it will be good for a

420
00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:10,389
little more of the same as  the positions

421
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:13,359
are usually that the banks also that I

422
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,739
pay attention to the banks a lot because in the end

423
00:18:14,739 --> 00:18:16,809
if the banks  They do it, it shouldn't be

424
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:19,720
so bad for the business. Okay, and

425
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,429
above all what they are also talking about is

426
00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:23,139
that smart versus smart contracts are

427
00:18:23,139 --> 00:18:24,940
going to have a lot of impact

428
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:29,259
on the link in how things are done

429
00:18:29,259 --> 00:18:32,559
in the world. We are seeing that

430
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,929
bogota  It is going to contribute 2 thousand 800

431
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:38,529
million for funds for matins

432
00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:40,629
goldman sachs visa and paypal that is, large

433
00:18:40,629 --> 00:18:43,389
companies are getting a lot in the

434
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:46,310
topic of blogs

435
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,280
because we understand that it is a revolution to

436
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,420
know the internet has gone through many

437
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:54,170
stages the first was the first the

438
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,700
first was  as a decentralization

439
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,400
of operations and the internet the darpa network

440
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,310
was born as a defense system a

441
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,690
system during the cold war while there

442
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:04,490
were nuclear tensions between

443
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:07,340
russia and the usa there was fear that the

444
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,960
russians would launch a missile that could

445
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,140
use their control center in the center

446
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,370
control of the American

447
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:15,080
response and missile launches,

448
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,570
so to solve this, what was

449
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,190
done was to create a defense network.  nsa that

450
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,830
was to pray for a father or mother of the

451
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,950
internet in which there were different

452
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:27,350
nodes distributed throughout the country that

453
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:30,170
had the ability to fulfill each

454
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,390
other that was decentralization of

455
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,760
operations after they began to decentralize

456
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,470


457
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,350
services, mail services, campaigns of  marketing

458
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:42,950
campaigns of attention to the public that is,

459
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,350
the way of communicating with people began to change

460
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,970


461
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,289
then we have seen that there was a

462
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:50,120
decentralization of communication,

463
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,429
the issue of the boom of

464
00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:54,830
social networks and the boom of all

465
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:57,260
microblogs and all these things has been crucial  that have

466
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,929
given wings to the communication that

467
00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:02,800
was previously managed

468
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,410
and monopolized by certain

469
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:08,080
televisions and newspapers, press and others,

470
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,050
now anyone can publish a

471
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:13,570
news anywhere and appear

472
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:16,420
on the front page of the 'new york times'

473
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,420
okay, well, what is the  part of

474
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,070
blog sein goes towards the decentralization

475
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,200
of value and trust, that is,

476
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,060
we are going to take  the things that are worth

477
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,880
money and we are going to take the things that

478
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,370
are reliable to a network that is going to

479
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:32,470
be above it is a kind of layer

480
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:37,200
within the internet this layer has

481
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,490
optimized services through

482
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,520
speed we are going to see why it is fast

483
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,320
because  It is treatable and because it is safe,

484
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,520
good characteristics because basically

485
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,970
a block change is an

486
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,680
accounting book like the one that a company may have

487
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,090
or the one that a family may have

488
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:56,730
where we start the month and say

489
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:59,580
we start with a thousand dollars,

490
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,220
now I spend 100 dollars on it.

491
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,620
rent is worth then then I put a

492
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,320
note that says 100 - and I put a

493
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,930
balance that is 900 some

494
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:12,870
accounting book to use as it is worth because

495
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,940
it is nothing else blogs in is nothing else it

496
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,760
is simply an accounting book

497
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,230
that is managed in a

498
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,750
distributed database is that

499
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,240
distributed database is public and accessible to

500
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,670
everyone in the public blogs of

501
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:29,850
asse etéreo go to be it coin see

502
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:33,220
any of the networks  It is public

503
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:37,480
and it is important because that means that it does not

504
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,380
require that a company does not require

505
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,210
a large storage capacity, a

506
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,890
large hardware capacity to

507
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,780
manage all this information, but rather it

508
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,400
will be distributed and replicated with

509
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,429
which it is secure and in addition to being a

510
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:53,200
Distributed database and all

511
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,210
the information being distributed

512
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:57,220
can also be executed or there are applications

513
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,809
that are distributed distributed over

514
00:21:58,809 --> 00:22:01,000
the network, that is to say, imagine that it is one

515
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,470
more layer on the internet where there is

516
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:05,919
information and programs and applications

517
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,700
in accordance with acts in a consensual way,

518
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,620
that is, a  When a transaction starts it

519
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,659
has to be approved by

520
00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:16,690
a number of nodes and it is also

521
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:18,250
auditable, that is, all the

522
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,990
transactions that are made are visible

523
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,789
, that is why I say that it is anonymous but not

524
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:26,169
so basic as we work there when

525
00:22:26,169 --> 00:22:29,350
a block network is created and new is  you can

526
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,210
do with your based for example on

527
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,289
zero

528
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:34,630
the first thing that is generated is a

529
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:36,280
genesis block that will  be the lock without

530
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:36,940
original

531
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,040
that has a series of properties has

532
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,740
a time stand has a

533
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:45,250
unique signature and is known by all the nodes

534
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,560
of the network of this node is this block is

535
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,270
the most important and all

536
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,770
transactions have to end in the

537
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:53,680
then  at the end, that is, then

538
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,630
new transactions are generated, next

539
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:56,890
point in our accounting book,

540
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,720
because the next block

541
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,360
that is, well, look, I have made a

542
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,900
transfer of x money or x of x

543
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,510
bitcoin to from this wallet to this other,

544
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,940
then all this is worth  it is stored it is

545
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:13,540
processed it is validated it is signed with a

546
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,330
unique signature with a hash and this block has its

547
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:19,600
unique signature and the hash of the

548
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,390
previous block and so on in such a

549
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:24,220
way that if we take a block

550
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,350
of a transaction we can see all the

551
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,210
transactions that are  have

552
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:30,010
previously done in that block so it is

553
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:32,110
auditable

554
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,420
how the end works when we

555
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,179
want to make a payment on the internet

556
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:38,380
we request a transaction  n

557
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,940
we are connected with a

558
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,799
blog change client x we request a

559
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:43,570
transaction I want to pay this amount

560
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,970
of bitcoins to [ __ ] to this account

561
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:49,780
then what happens the client launches that

562
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:53,860
request to the nodes of the

563
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,980
block change network where those

564
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,510
nodes are connected are the  They are going to be in charge of

565
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,880
validating the transaction depending on the

566
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,059
type of network, as the consensus is,

567
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:06,250
once it is validated by x number of

568
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,470
nodes, all have decided that this

569
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,120
transaction is valid that there is no

570
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,150
alteration in everything in everything in the  chain

571
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,910
of blocks that has been sent,

572
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:17,520
a new block is generated

573
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,940
that is number 4 and is number 4, which is

574
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,160
the block that already contains

575
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,170
the transaction information and that block is

576
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:27,810
in turn added to the block change chain and

577
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:29,910
that chain  from block thein it is

578
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:32,130
redistributed to all the databases and

579
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:33,690
then transactions will be finalized

580
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:36,540
is to finish the payment according to it is a

581
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,090
process that sometimes takes a

582
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:41,700
little time because  Depending on

583
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,040
how overloaded the network is, there are

584
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,070
times when the commission that we want to

585
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,810
pay is like banks in the end,

586
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:50,460
if we want the transaction to be

587
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,830
fast, we have to pay more commissions

588
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,720
not to a bank but to the network to these

589
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,210
nodes  that they are around here validating and if

590
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:59,340
we want to pay little then more will be done

591
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,820
with more time

592
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,980
that it has to be reliable because

593
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,510
the thing is far above it is a

594
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,700
standard protocol is based on a p2p network such

595
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,300
as

596
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,580
[Music]

597
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,789
torrent and all these  Actions that there was

598
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:15,559
the exchange of films because it is the

599
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:17,740
same protocol but it is made to

600
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:23,120
manage it the traffic database

601
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,850
does not stop

602
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,980
transactions everything is encrypted with two

603
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:31,820
different means consists of 256 and 7 m of 160 and

604
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,990
well then it has a series of

605
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,990
members  and other is worth we can

606
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,789
differentiate two types of blogs in there are

607
00:25:37,789 --> 00:25:39,679
two types of blogs in the high types

608
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,360
there are two ways to differentiate

609
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,090
jane blogs depending on the scope we can

610
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:46,490
differ  start blog same networks

611
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:48,980
according to their scope, differentiating

612
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,200
a public network of blogs change,

613
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,510
anyone can connect, for

614
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,600
example bitcoin 90,

615
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,910
that means that any user

616
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:00,460
who wants to belong to the network can

617
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,110
connect and become a

618
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:05,350
validator node, according to the other hand.

619
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,840
in the private ones that would be the ones that are

620
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,610
used internally within

621
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,850
companies for production

622
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:16,240
processes of industrial process management of whatever

623
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,820
it is because we have here one that are

624
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,490
more or less typical and perhaps the one that

625
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:23,879
I have seen the most is to see  the jr

626
00:26:23,879 --> 00:26:27,389
but we go there is fat rifle pound and

627
00:26:27,389 --> 00:26:28,799
then there is the art consortium that are

628
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,169
more at the level of cooperation between

629
00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:33,749
different organizations agree

630
00:26:33,749 --> 00:26:35,699
so these are a little more

631
00:26:35,699 --> 00:26:37,229
specific there are a couple of them that are

632
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:41,099
lira and alastair pounds but we go the most

633
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,629
typical and  what we are going to find

634
00:26:42,629 --> 00:26:45,329
in 99% of the time are going to be

635
00:26:45,329 --> 00:26:46,589
public networks and that is what we can

636
00:26:46,589 --> 00:26:49,079
work with as well and we can create podem  You

637
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,729
differentiate the second the scope or

638
00:26:50,729 --> 00:26:52,499
according to the way of approving the

639
00:26:52,499 --> 00:26:54,449
transactions, there are two ways to approve

640
00:26:54,449 --> 00:26:55,889
the transactions, on the one hand, we have

641
00:26:55,889 --> 00:26:58,229
the possibility of doing it by proof of

642
00:26:58,229 --> 00:27:01,319
work, which is how bitcoin

643
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,719
1 version 1 of terol works and that means

644
00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:06,119
that  There are a series of nodes working and

645
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:07,829
when the nodes that are working

646
00:27:07,829 --> 00:27:09,839
that all have the same weight

647
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:12,119
when voting decide that this transaction is

648
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:15,899
correct because that transaction is approved

649
00:27:15,899 --> 00:27:18,929
and passed to the network there is another type of

650
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:21,839
test that is the test  Of bet, to

651
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:24,809
put it in some way, the steak well

652
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,729
in which they enter, for example, there is

653
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:28,979
fat pernet or pigs of pigs is also

654
00:27:28,979 --> 00:27:30,390
included in this

655
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:33,270
consensus format that consists in that

656
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:35,640
well, who are you? You are a node

657
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,680
that you have bet and you  You have a lot of

658
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,170
crypto currency, for example of

659
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:41,610
certain, it is worth it because if you have a

660
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,320
lot of currency of terms it means

661
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,480
that you trust that network a lot with

662
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,120
which you weight when it comes to  voting if this

663
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,460
transaction is good or bad is greater

664
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,840
than that of a new one that has fewer

665
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,660
entities, let's say that by a proof of

666
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,640
commitment to that network and then there

667
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,260
are already complex permits that are

668
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,470
more typical of internal organizations

669
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,970
where it can be defined than a mode

670
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,680
The specific thing is that you have to approve

671
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,570
the transactions.

672
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:09,269
Well, let's get to the middle of the question that

673
00:28:09,269 --> 00:28:11,039
are smart versus smart cons

674
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,690
are smart contracts that are

675
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:16,320
executed within the blog network and not

676
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,860
all blog networks support smart

677
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,559
cons but those that are  support, I

678
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,269
think they will have great success and this

679
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:26,009
is where I think

680
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:28,320
the shots will go in the next few years.They are

681
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,580
programs that are executed there, they are

682
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,309
written in standard languages, request

683
00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:34,269
and java does

684
00:28:34,269 --> 00:28:36,279
and they do not need, they do not need

685
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:38,739
intermediaries and  They also allow

686
00:28:38,739 --> 00:28:40,749
machine to machine transactions,

687
00:28:40,749 --> 00:28:42,639
that is, they do not need human intervention

688
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:44,589
to do things and like

689
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:47,480
all blogs they are

690
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,670
habitable that can  eden make use of oracles an

691
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:52,340
example if we want to imagine

692
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,610
that we have contracted a flight and within

693
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:58,760
the contract of the plane ticket we have

694
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,540
agreed an insurance in which if

695
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:06,080
the afternoon plane can the company the

696
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,700
company has to return a

697
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,370
certain amount  of money but it turns out

698
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:13,130
that we do not know how to know if there is no

699
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:15,410
possibility because there is nothing at the

700
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:18,440
airport in the system that allows us to

701
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,930
know if the plane has arrived on time or

702
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:22,670
not there is no gift of blogs in which

703
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,680
that is not happening  information we can

704
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,180
make use of oracles that are

705
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,370
external sources where we can check if there is

706
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,350
a web page we can see consult

707
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:32,060
the airport web page to find out

708
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,670
if that airport is and on the plane

709
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,770
in which I have traveled its time has arrived

710
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:38,900
at its  time or not if the time has not

711
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,970
arrived automatically the contract would be

712
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:43,970
executed and I would refund the

713
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:45,590
money automatically without the

714
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,720
intervention of anyone otherwise

715
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,610
we would have to start  ar the claim processes

716
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:51,870


717
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:54,870
for the delay but in this case being

718
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:57,059
a smart contract it would be solved

719
00:29:57,059 --> 00:29:59,610
at the moment and this is where it is expected

720
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:01,170
that there will be a high demand a high

721
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:03,120
demand from programmers and

722
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,890
security auditors because smart contracts

723
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:07,650
will  move a lot of money in

724
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,900
the future with which I think this

725
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:13,280
is a good niche to start

726
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:17,280
considering a future of work future

727
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,030
a silly example would be an exporter from the United States

728
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:22,920
wants to export bananas to Europe

729
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,860
very well but there is a condition that is to say

730
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,180
I want that  My bananas arrive well

731
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,620
because if I want my bananas to arrive

732
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,260
well, I will pay you what was agreed and if they

733
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,190
arrive badly, I will pay you less

734
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:36,630
as determined if they arrive well or badly,

735
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:38,850
for example because inside the

736
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:42,120
cargo hold of the ship there is a  series of

737
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,700
thermometers that what they are doing is

738
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,140
sending

739
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,410
thermal readings to the blocks every so often and then those

740
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:51,390
thermal readings will then be evaluated

741
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:54,320
by the smart against  And what it will do is

742
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,380
analyze if everything has gone well because it

743
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,050
will pay what it has to pay and if we

744
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:03,450
have exceeded the temperature above or

745
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,500
below because penalties will be applied

746
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,830


747
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:10,970
this is a video of how it works more or

748
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,970
less we have you are going to see the  Language that

749
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,500
is very simple, that is, the

750
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,140
products of this is the supplier

751
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:21,799
we have the ship down here

752
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:24,919
we have the possibility of seeing the

753
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:27,139
contract where

754
00:31:27,139 --> 00:31:29,330
the actions are specified how often

755
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:32,600
the temperature is taken how often or

756
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,450
what margins  There is temperature and then

757
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:38,480
we have the different actors that you are going to

758
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,850
see here that the exporter will be the

759
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:43,600
importer and he and the carrier

760
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,549
then each one has their

761
00:31:46,549 --> 00:31:48,590
initialization that is to say here we would have

762
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:51,619
our balance here we would have the

763
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:54,590
balance of the importer they are at the moment they

764
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:57,220
are all at 0  and the economic balance

765
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,960
of the carrier and then there is the

766
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,279
contract in the contract is where

767
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,129
the minimum maximum van gogh temperatures are defined

768
00:32:04,129 --> 00:32:06,889
and the penalties as well as the

769
00:32:06,889 --> 00:32:09,200
contract, which is the one identified

770
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,669
well, then from there what

771
00:32:10,669 --> 00:32:13,789
will begin to happen in the ship, which is

772
00:32:13,789 --> 00:32:16,159
the tractor and that indicates the number of

773
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,230
units that transport well, because

774
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:20,330
when we start to send when the

775
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:23,029
thermometers begin to  put information

776
00:32:23,029 --> 00:32:25,820
in the blogs and what we are going to see what

777
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,990
happens

778
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:29,150
all those readings go from the

779
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:32,059
thermometers they are signed and

780
00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:34,700
saved within the contract in such a

781
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:37,460
way that everything we do

782
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:40,370
will receive a unique signature and will be

783
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:42,659
inserted  inside the block

784
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:44,849
we are going to make another reading this

785
00:32:44,849 --> 00:32:46,799
reading has been with a temperature of 4

786
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:47,700
degrees

787
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,669
we make a temperature reading in

788
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:53,720
this case it is 2 degrees for example and

789
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,070
we will add another event imagine this

790
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,690
in a chain on a boat that is

791
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:59,539
sailing during a  week in the

792
00:32:59,539 --> 00:33:02,340
atlantic because it would record all

793
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,019
this information depending on what

794
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:05,519
we read we are applying

795
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,590
penalties that we contact them to

796
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:11,970
apply penalty  lizations in a

797
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:13,590
higher or lower way depends on how it is

798
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,960
defined, it is also important to know that

799
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,149
the smart contract is auditable, that is,

800
00:33:18,149 --> 00:33:19,739
anyone can see the smartphone is there

801
00:33:19,739 --> 00:33:21,809
and anyone could also modify

802
00:33:21,809 --> 00:33:26,429
the requirements that they want to meet,

803
00:33:26,429 --> 00:33:28,590
that is, it is not, it is not something.  It is strict but

804
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,840
can be modified

805
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,970
during an agreement negotiation,

806
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,070
so well, at the end when it

807
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,929
ends when all the

808
00:33:36,929 --> 00:33:38,940
transactions end when all the

809
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,789
readings end we will see that the producer has

810
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:43,349
received his amount of two thousand

811
00:33:43,349 --> 00:33:46,979
five hundred dollars and the importer has

812
00:33:46,979 --> 00:33:48,359
a deficit of two thousand  Five hundred dollars,

813
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,520
which is what

814
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,280
the importer is, because because the

815
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,560
temperatures that we have been reading

816
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,820
were at all times within the

817
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:59,930
margins established in the sea against

818
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:02,780
this is where I see that it is a

819
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,480
possible source or this is going to have a

820
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,540
lot of impact for this  It would be another

821
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,399
example a little more complex.

822
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:14,330


823
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:17,810
time and this is a real example

824
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:20,179
that is the one I mentioned before this is an

825
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:22,520
example that I have done in the Carrefour chain they

826
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,699
decided to implement

827
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:27,909
traceability to chicken meat

828
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:32,030
so what do they do good because they have

829
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,489
a supplier that has laying

830
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,219
hens then when  the hens

831
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:38,929
lay their eggs, what this supplier

832
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:40,909
does is take the eggs and put them in

833
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:43,790
incubators and the chickens are

834
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,100
discharged into the block sein and

835
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,040
the incubator leader is indicated

836
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,230
wherever that egg has been incubated the date

837
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,239
of the  birth and the date on which it is

838
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:57,260
sent to the growing farm

839
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:01,040
when the farm lord receives

840
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,380
the order or receives the chickens to

841
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,560
create to raise them identifi is

842
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,030
identified within the blocks change

843
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,250
enter the data of his

844
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,980
breeder identifier the address  from the farm the

845
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,410
month of the arrival date and when

846
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:17,300
the time comes, you will enter the date

847
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,820
of shipment to the slaughterhouse during the

848
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,410
time the chickens are growing because

849
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,940
p  They will roast a series of

850
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,770
veterinary controls then the veterinarian will

851
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:27,320
say if the sisi this

852
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,900
particular chicken has required some type

853
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,150
of antibiotic treatment or not and all

854
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,860
that information is stored in the

855
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,260
blocks and what the veterinarian does the

856
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,500
food that the dog is eating  chicken because

857
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,450
there is a feed producer who is

858
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:44,420
sending them the information of sight since

859
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,400
sending this feed I think that I am sending

860
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,740
this batch and also I am sending you the

861
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,870
quality certificate in such a way that

862
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:53,480
in the block it is reflected all

863
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,640
the history of this animal  when it is

864
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,400
time to send it to the slaughterhouse what

865
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,610
they do is in the slaughterhouse they enter it

866
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:03,530
on the slaughter date they

867
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:06,440
identify the batch they indicate the date of

868
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,140
shipment to the warehouse and the expiration date

869
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:11,810
this is then sent to the

870
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:15,620
distribution chain and  They mark with lots the

871
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:18,170
arrival date and the delivery date of the store at the

872
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:20,030
end when the user who buys a

873
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:24,440
chicken in this chain of a

874
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,000
certain of u  not one of the certain

875
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,770
providers that is the one that reached

876
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:30,890
this agreement if you

877
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:34,010
read that qr code with a qr code reader you

878
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,330
will know what the

879
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:38,090
complete history of that animal has been, that is, you will

880
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:40,850
know where it has been what it is  What is

881
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:43,040
what you have eaten if you have had a

882
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,020
problem that is, we are going to have all the

883
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,870
information

884
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,850
companies that are included in

885
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:51,430
these topics of blogs saint because there is

886
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:54,280
everything there we can see ibm sap intel

887
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,040
cisco there are different networks of the different

888
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,200
networks  Well, there are people who are there, there are

889
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,030
companies that are involved in one by two,

890
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:05,350
we can see strictly from loita bots,

891
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:09,190
that is, depending on the network because it

892
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:12,130
has a series of promoters but still

893
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:14,050
it is not, they are not exclusive according to

894
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:16,540
the people or the certain  companies

895
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,520
can bet on various

896
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,350
blogging technologies depending on their

897
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:22,380
needs at certain times it is

898
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,660
worth more we have

899
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,780
technological impact that we will have in

900
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,970
the future

901
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:31,890
for example is  to becomes a

902
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:35,220
new form of investment because until

903
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,900
now when companies are formed

904
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,530
when they are founded they start with a capital

905
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:42,210
if at a certain moment they need to

906
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:45,240
expand that capital they have to

907
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,820
turn to suppliers to banks for

908
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:51,060
loans to be able to obtain that capital

909
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,349
they need  To grow

910
00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:55,269
normally they are usually high amounts

911
00:37:55,269 --> 00:37:58,180
with which they need either a

912
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,190
large loan or an investor that puts in a lot of

913
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:02,289
money because through crypto

914
00:38:02,289 --> 00:38:04,059
currencies and the psycho that are the

915
00:38:04,059 --> 00:38:06,729
initial ones, knowing what we are doing

916
00:38:06,729 --> 00:38:10,029
is allowing small companies

917
00:38:10,029 --> 00:38:12,579
find a way to finance themselves in

918
00:38:12,579 --> 00:38:14,410
a simple way by creating a crypto currency

919
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:17,109
in such a way that I sell and instead of

920
00:38:17,109 --> 00:38:19,529
having two instead of having a large

921
00:38:19,529 --> 00:38:23,349
provider or a large lender or a

922
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:24,519
large investor who is giving me the

923
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:26,799
money I can have many small ones

924
00:38:26,799 --> 00:38:29,229
investors who are providing me with the

925
00:38:29,229 --> 00:38:31,140
capital I need

926
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,600
and who also do not necessarily have

927
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,070
to be from my country but I can  star

928
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:40,230
receiving money from japan, colombia

929
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:43,290
or france, i don't care, i don't

930
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:45,030
need a bank in between, but all

931
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,500
this financing will come to me

932
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,320
through block sing and it will also

933
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,510
be without having to go to a

934
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:56,000
specific bank or  a bank to a physical bank

935
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,010
I have always seen that this also poses

936
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,110
a threat to certain companies,

937
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:04,820
for example the compendium that I

938
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:07,160
always wear as glasses that is google apple

939
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,100
facebook and amazon that are the four

940
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,260
technological giants of today

941
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,540
could get, for example, of a  In a

942
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:17,780
very simple way in the world of the loan,

943
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:21,560
that is, they could start cryptocurrencies,

944
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,780
in fact Facebook is doing it and

945
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,810
from there they could give loans or they

946
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:29,150
could give any type of aid or they

947
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,370
could do any type of

948
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:35,480
management through the cheyne pad, skipping to

949
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,540
banks and preventing banks or

950
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,730
making banks lose a

951
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:42,950
part of their customers and then

952
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,390
we also have the possibility of having credit

953
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:46,250
s  In financial interest that is

954
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,090


955
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:49,570
sometimes sometimes a pain

956
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:51,820
in insurance companies in the insurance company also

957
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,500
has a very great importance let's see

958
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,990
that they can access if

959
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:58,210
we had all our

960
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:00,310
insured data in a block change any

961
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:02,650
company in that network could consult

962
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,410
our  data and they could know if we

963
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:07,600
are good insured or if we are

964
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,300
insured we are too much of

965
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,040
we generate too much expense to the company

966
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,230
the change processes could be

967
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,970
immediate because in the end it is

968
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:18,640
still a contract that can be renewed or

969
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,350
can be changed at a

970
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:23,260
certain time  And it is immediate at night and

971
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,840
what scares me the most about this

972
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,640
is honestly the part of the possible use

973
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,650
of the hotel of the internet for things

974
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:32,110
for risk analysis now that

975
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:34,660
all cars have a billion

976
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,330
sensors let's imagine that those sensors

977
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:39,310
have accelerometers  we have zero

978
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:41,470
meters we have in kilometers we can

979
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,420
know a lot of information so

980
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:46,050


981
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:48,250
Knowing how the owner of the car drives knowing how the owner of the

982
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,950
car drives and even if the owner

983
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,600
has not had an accident, an

984
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,760
insurance company could establish

985
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,740
that that user should have

986
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,600
a higher fee because their

987
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,130
driving is more aggressive than that of the

988
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:02,170
rest, then we could  arrive at

989
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:05,140
insurance price customizations

990
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:08,619
even by analysis

991
00:41:08,619 --> 00:41:12,670
of user behavior in how you use your vehicle

992
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,319
on the protection of copyright

993
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,150
this is something that is happening now and it

994
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:19,510
is based on a man who had

995
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:23,619
an image that a company  He decided to

996
00:41:23,619 --> 00:41:25,990
auction then he chose in his image

997
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:29,500
from his instagram I think it was and what

998
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,640
they did was organize it, they

999
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,619
organized that image and they auctioned it, they

1000
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:36,910
sold it for an amount of money,

1001
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:39,549
it was not excessive, it seems that it was 70 euros,

1002
00:41:39,549 --> 00:41:42,730
something like that and the author received those  70

1003
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:44,410
euros that this has to be nice to

1004
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:47,440
organize that I have lame the image was

1005
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,920
generated by a token generated a unique signature  ca and

1006
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,920
that image is associated with that touch if

1007
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,750
your copy is the image that image does not

1008
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,430
have the token with which it is not the

1009
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:59,760
original image, that is, we are

1010
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,290
enabling something that is the

1011
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:04,750
originality of the image compared to

1012
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:07,119
any other copy that could exist

1013
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,040
in  Internet that you could have done by

1014
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,380
downloading the image of this type that

1015
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:14,230
you can see in the foundation app

1016
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:16,809
you can see that things are being auctioned

1017
00:42:16,809 --> 00:42:18,500
in the ethereal

1018
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,780
you can make rentals there are companies

1019
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,950
that are dedicated to renting

1020
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:24,350
storage vehicle housing

1021
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:26,300
in  There has been a time in the cloud

1022
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:29,120
when the crypt chia currency had a

1023
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,100
very large rise because instead

1024
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,770
of looking with the chia glass based

1025
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:35,690
on process what they do is look

1026
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:37,940
through the storage you offer

1027
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,350
instead of your processing capacity  for the

1028
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:41,780
network what you offer is your

1029
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,670
storage capacity for the network in such a way

1030
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:46,370
that you give up 50 gb of your hard

1031
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:50,480
drive for other network users to

1032
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,130
use them co  mo

1033
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:53,720
storage system a kind of

1034
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,720
competition from dropbox but

1035
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,340
decentralized fully encrypted and

1036
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,490
only you would have access to the files

1037
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:02,840
such as cards, ok and then

1038
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,930
finally is a comment creating

1039
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:08,720
a blog without private is not complicated

1040
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,430
that is if someone wants to do the

1041
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:12,650
test all you have to do is download

1042
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:15,380
for example get which is the ethereal software

1043
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,710


1044
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:19,530
we can create a new network with a create

1045
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:21,930
a genesis block a network name and

1046
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:24,810
generate the touches and nodes or we can

1047
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,420
connect to the standard network and

1048
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:31,260
become a  Node more of the

1049
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:34,740
cerio network than the general network, well

1050
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:37,660
it has come this far, I don't know if

1051
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:40,390
there will be any questions, I'll be

1052
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:44,680
happy to answer you.

1053
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,540


1054
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,310


1055
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:50,170


1056
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:52,180
jane blogs who incredible the amount

1057
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:54,280
of things that can be done if there are

1058
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,250
questions there are several questions so I

1059
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:59,140
go with the first one we go to  Affiliate to

1060
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,790
is as well as basic good and

1061
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:02,860
you have probably been asked many times what type of

1062
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:03,220
blogs

1063
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:05,890
jane is the most recommended bitcoin ogre

1064
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:09,430
probably refers to christ currency

1065
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:11,890
or it depends if we are talking about

1066
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:13,480
crypto currency that we are talking about

1067
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,860
a network of brooches  and what I want is

1068
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,470
when we talk about a blog network is

1069
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:19,510
because the kane blog asks if

1070
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:20,950
we are talking about the blog network and

1071
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,780
we can work calmly or

1072
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:24,850
with zero if we want a public one

1073
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:26,800
or we can work with the hyper lakers

1074
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,650
that  it is one of the private ones that is

1075
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:31,420
sponsored and managed by ibm

1076
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,310
has a framework that can be

1077
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:36,040
downloaded from ibm and you can set up

1078
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,400
a network of blogs in concert

1079
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,720
graphical environment and in a way

1080
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,280
like it is

1081
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,670
worth the second question says there will be

1082
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:47,620
some way to implement  a

1083
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:50,260
block change type system to regularize the

1084
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:55,770
attacks to regularize the attacks

1085
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:59,240
and if it is a question of identifying the truth

1086
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,950
that I do not know here is that in block cha  In

1087
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:03,800
the imagination it is very free of each one

1088
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,550
so it is very difficult to

1089
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:10,010
decide to say yes or no because it

1090
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:12,290
is a completely new world that is,

1091
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:15,640
we can investigate and we can develop

1092
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,990
practically anything in smart

1093
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:18,950
contract

1094
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:21,200
but everything that is going to be played  hoisted,

1095
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,630
that is, if I make an attack

1096
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:26,450
through this touch, hoisted in the end they will

1097
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:29,770
reach who to whom has been

1098
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:34,400
standardized, so to speak,

1099
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,170
an attack is directed at someone, this

1100
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:37,850
would be the safest and most concrete way to

1101
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:39,100
do

1102
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:41,480
it.  a question do you think that the

1103
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,280
script or currency may have a type

1104
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,200
of vulnerability buner in terms of its

1105
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,609
logic

1106
00:45:46,609 --> 00:45:49,279
in terms of logic it is very difficult

1107
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:51,200
normally the cases that have occurred of

1108
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,079
hacking crypto currencies have been two

1109
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:57,079
in two different ways or  Well in which I

1110
00:45:57,079 --> 00:45:59,780
commented before that he was

1111
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:02,390
accessing a server that stores the

1112
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:05,890
wallets of the users and

1113
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:09,800
stealing them and the other option that

1114
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:13,220
I have seen is in the networks that are

1115
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:15,520
tests that are based on proof of work you

1116
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:19,610
need to have 50 50% plus one of

1117
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:23,000
the controlled nodes to be able to go

1118
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,360
back a transaction to say it is not

1119
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,460
easy to revoke something or to say that something is

1120
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:31,550
false if you do not have control of the network

1121
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:34,010
is  To say if you have a network of 10

1122
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:36,620
nodes, it would have to have 6 controlled ones

1123
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:39,880
that said the same thing to be able to do

1124
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,310
to be able to do something that was

1125
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:45,530
illegal or that was not coherent

1126
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:49,290
with the network in that case if it could be done

1127
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:51,240
here there is a question of  David says that he

1128
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,070
developed his block chains tension and that

1129
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:54,780
he found many elements of

1130
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:57,360
sins and when he finished them with others he

1131
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,100
said then we can ensure the

1132
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,930
continuity and security of a block

1133
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:04,010
chains and the changes are so fast,

1134
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:06,680
well I hope that now that

1135
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,320
companies are  getting more seriously if it is

1136
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,960
possible that the thing ends up

1137
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,030
standardizing I know a lot more if it is

1138
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:16,070
true that in the end if it did it

1139
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:17,810
some time ago I think that the

1140
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:20,440
block change technology is m  uy new is to say the

1141
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:24,170
birth of bitcoin in the paper of

1142
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:28,220
2008 of 2008 crypto currencies began to be made

1143
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,510
and other

1144
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:31,130
good because when they have become

1145
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:32,810
more popular the block chain has been in the

1146
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:35,380
last four or five years

1147
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:37,869
with which it is true that we were

1148
00:47:37,869 --> 00:47:39,460
In the boom we are in the

1149
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:42,039
expansion and if it is possible that we

1150
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:44,619
find things that are still

1151
00:47:44,619 --> 00:47:47,529
going to continue to change in fact as

1152
00:47:47,529 --> 00:47:51,220
an added comment is the video that I have

1153
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:53,529
shown of the transactions that I

1154
00:47:53,529 --> 00:47:55,089
did with hyper léger but with a

1155
00:47:55,089 --> 00:47:57,369
web version that now  it does not exist

1156
00:47:57,369 --> 00:47:59,710
suddenly when he has gone to do it with the

1157
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,079
because I like to do it live but

1158
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,900
but I found that it is not there

1159
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,849
then now they have already passed it it has

1160
00:48:06,849 --> 00:48:08,680
gone to hyper leites it will manufacture that

1161
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,910
you have to install it on the computer

1162
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:11,980
you have to do then  I have not had

1163
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:14,109
time to do all the

1164
00:48:14,109 --> 00:48:15,970
configuration but we are going if it is true

1165
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:17,559
that we are at the beginning with which I

1166
00:48:17,559 --> 00:48:18,670
do not know we can find many

1167
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:22,029
excellent modifications there are o  Another

1168
00:48:22,029 --> 00:48:22,690
good question,

1169
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:24,960
taking into account

1170
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,359
at the moment taking into account the amount

1171
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:29,339
of cryptocurrencies and

1172
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:32,490
existing technologies to support them, there is some

1173
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:34,400
body that regulates their implementation,

1174
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,380
insecurity, some iso, for example, or

1175
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,810
some financial regulations so far

1176
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:41,970
nothing so far nothing there is no type

1177
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:44,609
of legislation  and in fact the principle

1178
00:48:44,609 --> 00:48:47,339
of blog saint is also a bit, it is a

1179
00:48:47,339 --> 00:48:49,200
bit that each one does what you want to

1180
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,690
predict you have to comply with the

1181
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:54,240
rules of the receiving network create

1182
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,570
your own block without without without having to

1183
00:48:57,570 --> 00:49:00,869
standardize have any kind of compliance

1184
00:49:00,869 --> 00:49:04,560
There is no type of regulation there is no type

1185
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,810
of legislation in that sense we are

1186
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:08,339
concerned about legislating on the subject of

1187
00:49:08,339 --> 00:49:10,890
taxes and how and how to manage the

1188
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:13,400
money that is produced there of course

1189
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,690

00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:17,400
