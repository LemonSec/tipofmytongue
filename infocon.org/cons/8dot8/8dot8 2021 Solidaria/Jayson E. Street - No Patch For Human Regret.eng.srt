1
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:16,320
then

2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:29,840
then

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:43,840
me

4
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:57,839
so

5
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,840
is

6
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:10,560
jason thank you so much for your support we hope 
that we can invite you the next year for chile to  

7
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:20,160
do a physical conference thank you so much because 
we know that you do it only a few talks this year  

8
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:31,680
that's in an honor for us to have with us today 
thank you so much gracias uh one of diaz uh uh  

9
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,360
and unfortunately that's probably the most of 
my spanish that i can do without uh ruining the  

10
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:47,520
language uh i i have to uh apologize i'm american 
so i only speak one language and i'm from texas  

11
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:55,840
i don't speak it very well um but i 
make up for it i talk very loud and fast  

12
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,600
so uh so i've got this talk now 
i'm going to share my screen

13
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,120
hopefully everybody can see the kittens

14
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:15,920
yes okay so this talk i usually do 
a warning sign when i'm doing a um  

15
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,719
the uh hold on i'm trying to see if i

16
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,840
can

17
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,280
i'm sorry i was trying to trying to 
get that one thing done it's like uh  

18
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,719
so what i'm going to do is i uh i set up a warning 
label for people so it's like because usually  

19
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,440
some of my talks are offensive meaning that i'm 
breaking into places and doing things like that  

20
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:53,200
and instead of that what it is i'm going to 
be offending a lot of people in our industry  

21
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:02,240
so uh so that's what this is about this is uh 
about our industry uh talk this is pointed to us

22
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:10,880
so uh the title of the talk is no pass for human 
regret breaking people to break into networks

23
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:27,680
and and basically it's like i've always 
said uh when you break into a server or  

24
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,760
um compromise it or expose vulnerabilities in 
a server or a network uh you don't hurt its  

25
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:40,880
feelings it doesn't get it doesn't feel bad that 
you compromise it's just a computer it's inanimate  

26
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:50,880
uh so the same can't be say when you break into 
a network using a employee using a person uh when  

27
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:58,240
you uh misdirect them uh when you uh tell them 
what uh that you're doing one thing and then  

28
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,520
you do something else that's the difference so 
we're going to talk into that and we're going  

29
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,440
to delve into that a little bit more this 
is mostly about the ethics of red teaming

30
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:19,920
this is the bio because there's supposed 
to be a bio page of who i am um is it is  

31
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:26,720
the least interesting and uh i you can you can 
search on that stuff it's like uh the whole thing

32
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:36,080
so uh there's no patch for human stupidity 
i think we've all seen these t-shirts and i  

33
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:44,640
have to admit that i own one um i actually used 
to wear i mean i before i evolved my outlook on  

34
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:52,800
what i do this was hilarious but it's not 
anymore and we're gonna go into why that is

35
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:01,599
uh and also i have to say when i go in uh and i 
talk about these things i'm talking about this  

36
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:09,280
industry remember i'm going from my perspective 
and my path i'm not calling anyone else out in  

37
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,679
red teaming i'm not calling anyone else and 
blue teaming i'm not calling out well i'm  

38
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,960
calling out a couple of companies specifically 
but i'm not calling out anyone in our industry  

39
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:25,760
uh that that finger is pointed directly at me 
i'm looking at the mirror when i talk about these  

40
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:33,200
issues because everything i talk about i had i had 
those attitudes i had other but i changed and i  

41
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:45,680
hope more of the people in the industry change so 
uh there's no password i hate this cartoon this is  

42
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:54,079
the actual cartoon that ran in the papers that 
people were like boom this is should be good um  

43
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:02,400
it's got the data security it's got um technology 
in one corner and then dave in the other corner um

44
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,200
and that's so insulting and that's how 
our industry handles users we like to  

45
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,120
use them as the excuse for our bad 
technology instead of trying to get  

46
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:27,040
technology more and more technology to 
protect the humans why don't we get the humans  

47
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:34,000
to protect the technology they are better 
suited for that than the technology but we  

48
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,080
don't give them credit and we write them off and 
we treat them like a liability instead of an asset

49
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,839
and a funny story i was so 
upset about this cartoon  

50
00:09:51,440 --> 00:10:00,000
that my boss at the time jason burns actually 
contacted the artist and had them fix it

51
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,680
that is how you should be seeing your users

52
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:14,320
that is what your users are they are a 
wonderful resource for you to go to to  

53
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,320
help you defend your company but are we doing 
that are we actually utilizing them like that  

54
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:27,360
instead of just writing them off so that's what 
uh that's how the cartoon should have always been

55
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:37,280
so i want to address two problems problem number 
one offensive teams don't have to be so offensive

56
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:47,120
and what do i mean by that i mean what are the 
functions of the red team we have gotten to the  

57
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,200
point where red teams are the ones that break 
things in yeah they're like something separate  

58
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,200
from the industry they're like this uh everybody 
wants to be a red teamer everybody when they  

59
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,280
break when they want to get into information 
security they want to get into pin testing  

60
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:10,319
they want to get into breaking things and i 
always have to remind people you do understand  

61
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,319
that the only reason that red teams exist

62
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,079
is to make the blue teams better

63
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:29,840
and when i say red teams just for people 
who don't know red teams mean people who do  

64
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:37,200
external exercises they take on the role of the 
adversary to test vulnerabilities in a network  

65
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,160
so they're the offensive 
teams and then the blue teams  

66
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,280
are the defensive teams they're the ones that 
work in the information security the the sock  

67
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:57,120
the uh they do the protections of a company uh 
they man the firewalls the ids's do the hard work

68
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:07,199
so that has always been the red tees function 
is just to make the blue team better the red  

69
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:15,040
team does not exist without the blue team 
it's like so the blue team is hiring or  

70
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:23,840
utilizing a red team mindset just to make their 
defenses better and we've lost that along the way

71
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:34,319
red teams have gotten so to the point where it's 
this big macho you know oh i'm i'm the red team  

72
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,240
i'm going to come in and i'm going to smash things 
it's like and like like that's that's that's going  

73
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:48,960
to help your users like like that approaches to 
your users that you're an advocate for them for  

74
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:55,760
securing them when you're coming off more like 
an adversary how are they supposed to react

75
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:04,880
one of the sayings that upset me the most 
um and there's so many different red teamers  

76
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,720
i've heard say this over the years i mean 
over the last decade i keep hearing this quote  

77
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:20,320
in uh books and talks it's like uh from 
conversations uh this is a quote from mike tyson  

78
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:31,120
everyone has a plan until they get punched in the 
face hey first of all i personally don't get any  

79
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:38,560
kind of life advice from a convicted rapist who 
tattoos his face and thinks that's a good idea and  

80
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:47,839
when he got punched so much uh in the face during 
a boxing match he bit the ear off of his opponent  

81
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,200
second of all i'm tired of him getting 
so much credit for these quotes

82
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:06,800
mike tyson borrowed this quote from helmet 
von molka the elder the prussian general

83
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,840
he said no battle plan ever 
survives contact with the enemy

84
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,920
so instead of a quote trying to mean like you're 
you're a big bad guy that you're going to come in  

85
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,120
and you're going to show your clients you're going 
to punch them in the face and see if they have  

86
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:36,080
a plan and show them where their vulnerabilities 
are this was supposed to be a warning to red teams

87
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:45,920
because plans are ever changing the battle 
is ever changing when you go to attack you  

88
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,079
never know what's going to be responding you 
never know what their forces are going to be  

89
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:56,640
like or what securities are in place it's 
like so all your plans and your your recon  

90
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:04,880
will not withheld withhold sometimes the actual 
engagement actually going in and breaking in

91
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:15,360
so it should be more of a warning 
no no i wanted to give mike tyson  

92
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,200
a little bit of credit you know i don't 
like being totally negative on someone  

93
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,840
so i found this quote from mike tyson 
i thought this was a really good one  

94
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,880
everybody you fight is not your enemy and 
everybody that helps you is not your friend

95
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:39,760
that is a very good info set quote 
because pin testing even though i'm  

96
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:49,520
fighting you i'm not your enemy and sometimes 
your employees or your contractors or your um uh  

97
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,240
your connections your other companies 
the colleagues are not your friend

98
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,319
yeah but he stole that one 
too what are you gonna do  

99
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:08,320
it's like so i think my best mike tyson 
quote comes from someone who's not mike tyson

100
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:18,960
this is john oliver because there's a rule 
if your life intersects with mike tyson's in  

101
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:24,960
any way whatsoever it is bedtime for you he 
is the canary in the coal mine for all of us

102
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:40,079
very well said uh so that's the problem we've 
become so adversarial we have created that  

103
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:48,560
mindset that we're boxing and we're battling our 
clients that our job is to batter them our job  

104
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:56,640
is to punch them our job is to be that offensive 
we are an advocate to help them be better secure  

105
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:08,480
we are doing adversarial simulations to check 
where the vulnerabilities are so they can be fixed

106
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:21,440
now that offensive red team mentality bleeds 
over to the blue team in the worst possible ways

107
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:33,680
instead of just getting the blue teams and the 
uh internal security to think as an adversary  

108
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:38,880
in a way to look for vulnerabilities to try 
to find vulnerabilities in their network  

109
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,240
they're beating up the 
users like they were beat up  

110
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,680
by the red team it's just a chain 
of abuse that they're going through

111
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,639
and i and one of the epitomes of this

112
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:05,840
happened christmas this happened 
uh just this last christmas 2020  

113
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,160
uh and it was the catalyst for this talk

114
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,360
i was so outraged by it uh i 
literally created this talk  

115
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,959
uh based on this but i found 
so much other worst things too

116
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:32,159
godaddy the web hosting company 
during the middle of a pandemic  

117
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:39,120
when people were losing their jobs they were 
trying to make sure they had money for rent  

118
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,919
they were trying to see if they could 
survive the winner during a plague  

119
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:51,840
decided to send all their employees and 
telling them they got a christmas bonus

120
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:02,080
now there is one specific thing that i do 
when i'm doing a security awareness engagement

121
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,960
when i am showing executives when 
i'm doing demonstrations on the stage

122
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,160
my phishing messages

123
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:30,320
are diabolical they are very i i involve people 
that have died i involve uh uh casualties  

124
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:36,320
that have happened in the area uh natural 
disasters i've brought up horrible things  

125
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:45,120
to show people how dangerous it can be how 
people will get you to click on a link using very  

126
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:59,520
bad means and i've always stressed that i would 
never ever send that out to a real employee

127
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,840
you never manipulate an employee  

128
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:11,600
like that it is good for a demonstration 
you don't manipulate it like that  

129
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:19,840
that that and we'll get a little bit more and 
another one this happened in february of 2021  

130
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,639
they were telling people that they 
got back they could get vaccines  

131
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,920
they're telling the workers to register for 
people desperately scrambling to get the vaccine  

132
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:38,639
at the very beginning of 2021 a company a library 
decided to fish their employees thinking it  

133
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:44,960
was a good idea to fish their employees 
that they could get a covid 19 vaccine

134
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:54,159
you do not mess with your 
employees livelihood or their life  

135
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,480
those are two things that you do not use as 
fishing subjects internally you can use those  

136
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:14,720
as demonstrations never in a real life exercise 
because guess what you may have had a couple of  

137
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:24,720
disgruntled employees potential insider threats in 
your network after you sent that email out after  

138
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:31,520
you sent that phishing email out and and promised 
them a bonus or a vaccine and it turns out that  

139
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:38,560
they're in trouble and you faked it and there is 
no bonus or vaccine opportunity congratulations

140
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,680
your insider threat has quadrupled

141
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:53,760
because now instead of just having a couple 
i would be like every other one i would be a  

142
00:21:53,760 --> 00:22:00,560
long-standing employee and i would have received 
that and i would be mad af it would be very bad

143
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,480
but also the same thing so you can't do 
that but the same thing goes to red teamers

144
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,600
red teamworks have this mentality 
where it's like they go in they  

145
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,320
can break these things compromise 
these people and then they're like

146
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:29,200
we're done here's your report we'll work with 
some of the remediations but the company might  

147
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:35,200
have a lot of hurt feelings left over from 
that red team especially if they did social

148
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:47,680
engineering so basically we've got to 
learn to be better at giving a constructive  

149
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,840
positive message to the users 
that we compromise directly

150
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:05,680
and i will admit i've made mistakes i've talked in 
several of my talks that we don't have time to get  

151
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:13,200
into now for little stories but there's talks 
where it's like i promised uh a bank manager  

152
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:19,360
all these new computers just to the end of the 
the engagement that he got to find out that they  

153
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:26,000
weren't coming uh because i lied because i needed 
to compromise his whole bank and get access to  

154
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:35,840
his network and his computers which i did so yay 
me but but how did that what did i leave behind  

155
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:45,280
that was on me uh and i've i've done that on 
uh several different times i but one engagement  

156
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,680
i believe it was in west virginia for this 
location and i i can't uh say where but  

157
00:23:53,680 --> 00:24:02,640
my whole outlook uh changed because a person 
opened the door i held the door open for me and  

158
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:12,400
let me come in but i saw their face and i realized 
they knew they shouldn't have done that and then  

159
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,800
as i'm walking down the hallway and i've already 
compromised a couple machines i've already won

160
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:26,560
i saw them talking to another person looking at me 
and talking and discussing it and i know they were  

161
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:32,480
calling security i know they were going to report 
me i know they were going to do the right thing

162
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:39,520
i could have left out the door the door was 
right there next to me they were down that  

163
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:45,840
hall i could have left and been free 
and clear great findings i'm the hero

164
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:55,440
or i could change it up a little bit 
and lose i could let them catch me

165
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:07,040
fix their mistake and be able to recover from 
it and that's exactly what i did i got caught

166
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,840
that was such a bigger impact 
for that company's security  

167
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,600
because why i was able to show vulnerabilities

168
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,920
i was able to hold one of their 
employees up who did the right thing  

169
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:31,280
and show them by example what they should be 
doing not all the things that they did wrong

170
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:43,280
from that engagement from from then 
all the way to now i will always always  

171
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:50,800
lose part of the engagement the first two days 
i will destroy you the best i possibly can

172
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,320
on the third day is the day i get caught

173
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:05,680
i'm more obvious i'm more uh just a 
parent in what i'm doing it's like  

174
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:12,400
i make it very easy to get caught because 
that's what it's about it's about the lessons  

175
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:18,639
not the winning not not me winning 
it's about the client winning  

176
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:27,840
learning the lessons sometimes the hardest part 
of winning sometimes is dealing with sore losers

177
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,640
more than once after i've already won  

178
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,640
and i've allowed myself to get caught 
and then i explained to the people  

179
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:47,440
what i was doing how this was a thing and 
even having an employee vouch for me there

180
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,960
yeah they still wanted to call the cops

181
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:00,000
they that yeah they still wanted to call 
it the cops it's like and i had to do with  

182
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,840
that so you're also social engineering 
the people that you social engineered um

183
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:15,120
so what do we do internally what do the blue 
teams do before the red teams even get there

184
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:24,800
i do something what i call the three 
e's educate empower and enforce

185
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:34,240
this is what we need to start doing first we 
need to start teaching educating your users  

186
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,960
what is the biggest problem 
with security awareness classes

187
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:52,400
they're boring very very 
very boring not interesting  

188
00:27:53,120 --> 00:28:00,959
how does it relate to me how is this a 
thing information security has to learn  

189
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:09,040
to engage their users in information security 
from day one on the first day that they're hired  

190
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:16,880
they need to learn what their responsibilities 
are you teach them that their job role  

191
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:25,120
they are responsible for answering this many 
emails or processing this many whatevers  

192
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:35,920
or you give them metrics for what they do you need 
to include in those roles and responsibilities  

193
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:46,639
is securing the network that is a job 
responsibility not an afterthought not a test  

194
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,600
they take once a year that they click the answers 
multi-choice and say they're security aware  

195
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:59,040
it is a job responsibility for them to keep 
their job they have to make sure they're not  

196
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:05,040
clicking on malicious links they have to make sure 
they're reporting things that uh are suspicious

197
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:15,760
the next thing is we need to empower them that's 
where the security we can't just put it all  

198
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:23,040
on them it is securities team it is 
the blue team's job the company's job  

199
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,400
to empower the employees to be able to 
do that without any repercussions without  

200
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:38,000
uh any hindrance or adversarial relations if they 
try to report something or something that fails um  

201
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,560
one of the way that we do this is does 
your [ __ ] does your company have an  

202
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:50,800
extension a phone extension or an email 
address dedicated to information security  

203
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:58,160
so if someone does see something they can 
report it immediately and do everybody in  

204
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,840
that company know what that number 
is do they know what that email is  

205
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:12,560
are you creating an environment that rewards 
that kind of activity because when i talk about  

206
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:20,879
enforcement it's not just negative 
enforcement we need to reinforce the ideas  

207
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:33,280
that security is an everyday thing create 
a raffle every quarter uh a drawing a a a

208
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:44,800
and contest this contest what you do is you 
put in that uh if you report a suspicious email

209
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,920
if you report it you'll get 
uh one entry into the contest  

210
00:30:53,600 --> 00:31:03,840
if that suspicious email turns out to be an actual 
phishing email you get 10 entries into the contest  

211
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:14,400
now if you see someone walking into the facility 
without a badge and you question them or you  

212
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:25,200
report it to security that's 20 entries now as 
your company you can set aside every quarter um  

213
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:34,400
a thousand or whatever currency whatever amount 
you want to a gift card in a good denomination  

214
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:45,440
of money uh that will be an incentive for people 
to want to enter into it now that some that money  

215
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:51,440
does not change the prize money will always 
be the same every quarter so you can budget it

216
00:31:53,520 --> 00:32:01,760
but how many people enter into it is what 
changes so you're not going to have to have  

217
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:07,840
any unexpected cost but more and more people 
will participate and want to get a chance  

218
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:15,280
to win see how well your security improves when 
people think that there's something in it for them  

219
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,480
it will improve greatly because now it's 
not just about securing the company data  

220
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,840
no one cares about the company data it's 
about they have a chance to win a prize  

221
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:34,160
let's make sure i'm not clicking on anything 
suspicious let's make sure i'm watching to  

222
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:44,880
make sure people belong where they're supposed 
to go and you will see a vast improvement so i  

223
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:53,280
i want to leave it it's like uh on this last part 
it's like uh there is a patch for human stupidity  

224
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,840
it's called education people 
who say otherwise are stupid

225
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:11,680
we have gotten to the point in our industry where 
we've uh a lot of people have been burned out  

226
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:16,960
with the fact that this job 
sometimes seems impossible  

227
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:23,840
it seems like we're never going to be able 
to keep everything fixed or everything secure

228
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,879
and you're right we're not

229
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:37,840
especially if we're doing it by just our 
department if we're just doing it alone  

230
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:49,920
we are trying to not eliminate risk being on 
the internet is just inherent risk is just  

231
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:58,960
risky it's like so what we have to 
do is do our best to lower that risk

232
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:07,520
now one of the best ways to 
lower that risk is with help

233
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,840
from the ceo to the person in the mail room

234
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,800
those are members of your 
information security team

235
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,640
do you realize that and more 
importantly do they realize that

236
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:37,839
it's like because most of your employees don't 
even realize what information security is  

237
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,360
or how it actually relates and impacts their job

238
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,400
that's on us

239
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,480
that is on us to fix

240
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,000
an employee is doing the same job  

241
00:34:54,880 --> 00:35:03,600
day in and day out they are going to be the first 
one to notice when something strange happened

242
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,760
and if they are going to report that

243
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:21,680
then you have one of the biggest most fine-tuned 
intrusion detection systems known to man

244
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:38,400
no blinky boxes no technology humans employees 
users fellow co-workers that are working with you  

245
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:46,320
to secure your network that is the 
goal and just like any ids system  

246
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:58,480
that is built on technology the human ids requires 
fine tuning it requires to be programmed it needs  

247
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,120
that if it doesn't have it if it doesn't 
have the programming if it doesn't have the  

248
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:08,319
signatures if it doesn't know what to look out 
for then yeah it's not going to catch anything  

249
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:17,200
and that's not the fault of the technology or 
your users that was the person putting it in place  

250
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,560
and all your employees are in 
place they're doing their jobs  

251
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:28,960
show them how security is part of that job 
and how to report something that is unusual

252
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:39,839
so uh i'm supposed to leave some 
time for questions so here we go

253
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,839
uh mute

254
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:02,400
i'm sorry sorry i am mute thank 
you so much jason a great talk

255
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,680
i am looking for for question

256
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:21,840
i have a lot okay

257
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,840
he

258
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:53,920
do you think security's improved no no relation 
awareness of word um i believe it's starting

259
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:03,839
thanks to uh the news and uh 
thanks to television shows

260
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,440
unfortunately that is a double-edged sword

261
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,879
on one hand they're more aware of

262
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:21,440
threats on the other hand they have an exaggerated  

263
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:32,240
uh understanding of what the threat is they think 
it's um like hackers and hoodies on keyboards  

264
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:39,440
and not international crime gangs or nation 
states people who are trying to profit off of it  

265
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:47,280
i've always tried to explain to people hackers 
are not your problem criminals are your problem  

266
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:54,400
it's like that's what people don't understand 
it's not about trying to pawn a network  

267
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:02,240
or compromise it's about making money 
if i get robbed by someone with a gun  

268
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,760
i don't automatically assume 
that they made that gun  

269
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:14,160
that they're a gunsmith that they created it that 
they developed it and it's like that they you know  

270
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,359
hacked the bullets themselves you know to 
make sure that they shoot me properly no

271
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:30,960
they're using a tool to commit a crime yeah 
computers are extremely good for committing crime  

272
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,880
so criminals are taking tools 
that hackers may have developed  

273
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:42,000
or vulnerabilities they may have discovered 
that were already in the systems they just  

274
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:48,400
discovered it and did responsible disclosure 
of it and then they're using that to make money  

275
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,280
they don't know how it operates they 
don't know how it works they're just like  

276
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:59,040
downloading a youtube video seeing how 
the program runs and click get paid  

277
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:07,840
i mean there are some malware and ransomware games 
that operate support lines for their software for  

278
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:13,680
their malware because the user because they're 
users the criminals don't even understand how  

279
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:20,799
to use it it's like so we that we can't give them 
that much credit they're criminals there are some  

280
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:29,680
hackers that are criminals but most criminals are 
not hackers uh it's like if i go to a bank and  

281
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:39,040
they had the week before a bank teller get 
arrested for money laundering i don't go  

282
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:45,680
to my bank the next week and go say to my teller 
are you a black hat banker or a white hat banker  

283
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:52,879
because i i don't wanna i don't wanna work with 
a white a black hat banker that sounds stupid  

284
00:40:54,240 --> 00:41:00,399
it's like and it's just the same thing with white 
hat and black hat it's like you're a hacker or a  

285
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:09,760
criminal that to me is the designation um so 
we got to uh teach our users what the proper  

286
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:17,120
threat is it's no longer like 4-1-9 scams like 
the nigerian prince they keep looking for that  

287
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:23,759
because security keeps teaching them that 
with misspellings and something fantastical  

288
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,760
and then all of a sudden they're getting an email 
from their ceo about a wire transfer that they  

289
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:33,360
need authorized with the employee's name it's 
like perfectly spelled and they're falling for  

290
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:39,760
it we need to update our training show them what 
the real threats are not what the tv threats are

291
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:46,960
excellent

292
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,840
i would say for one thing um  

293
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:24,240
layers are always good it's always 
good to have certain layers saying that

294
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:33,920
before you uh and i don't mean 
this like literally but before you  

295
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:39,920
worry about antivirus before you worry 
about your infrastructure security  

296
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:49,680
make sure you're updating every single piece of 
software you can especially the operating system  

297
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,360
those are free operating system updates are free  

298
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:02,880
and most of the vulnerabilities are targeting 
vulnerabilities that have been passed  

299
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:16,479
there are still people in their internal networks 
whose machines are vulnerable to ms-0867 for those  

300
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:29,200
who don't know that is a windows vulnerability 
that came out two thousand and eight 2008 over a  

301
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:35,439
decade ago and they're still vulnerable to that 
and that is called the golden key you can just  

302
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:44,320
the golden ticket you're just in it's like go get 
past go collect the 200 and all the company data

303
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:53,839
so that's we need to keep patching but 
also when we're patching our networks  

304
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:00,880
what are we patching do you know 
every device that is on your network

305
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:09,120
you should have every ip 
address mapped or computer name  

306
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:17,600
that's on your network address and if a 
new device pops up someone should know  

307
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:24,080
because i promise you nine times out of 
time ten when i'm around that new device  

308
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:30,319
popping up on your network is mine and it 
is not named like the rest of your companies  

309
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:38,800
if you see a machine fyi called pwning 
machine 403 you're going to have a bad day  

310
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:46,240
i mean that's just what's going to happen so yes 
you have to you have to do those two basic things  

311
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:57,200
and that doesn't cost contractors or um extra 
money it's like that costs employees and work  

312
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:03,840
and effort and it's well worth it and 
that builds your foundation of security

313
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:34,640
ah that is a good question especially since 
uh i've been known to be on social networks  

314
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:44,879
from time to time um so uh i would say one 
thing it's um another double-edged sword  

315
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:55,360
it's like so uh because of the fact that 
uh i got my first book deal from twitter  

316
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:05,120
when i was just starting out as as a information 
security guy in a bank it's like i got  

317
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:10,400
that's what started me out on this path 
to be here speaking to you now was twitter

318
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:20,560
but there's a downside to that i've had people dox 
me people who have sent hate things people who've  

319
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,799
been disgusting online toward 
me because i'm more public

320
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:36,640
back in the day we there uh in irc and 
the bb uh s's we had uh a little bit more  

321
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:43,440
anonymity there were still jerks there were 
still trolls but i didn't know who you were  

322
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:52,240
really it's like you were a faith a 
picture uh avatar or a nickname uh  

323
00:46:52,880 --> 00:47:00,080
you were what you knew it was your consciousness 
that i was communicating but now i can see you and  

324
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:04,640
i can see that you're in a different country 
or i can see that you look different from me  

325
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:10,720
or i can see that your faith is different from me 
or your lifestyle or your gender is different from  

326
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:19,919
me and that has gone dramatically uh as a negative 
uh because we have to get to the point where  

327
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:28,799
um and this and this is going to be a hard 
one it's like because i can't solve it  

328
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:40,720
but we need to understand that with 
this internet comes a lot of information  

329
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:48,320
and awareness but it should also 
come with understanding and that's  

330
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:52,560
the key that we're missing and the 
compassion of that understanding

331
00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:00,720
it's like one of the things that recently has 
been going on is uh and i will straight out  

332
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:11,200
a minute is like where we have um women in 
tech women in general who post uh pictures  

333
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,120
uh on the internet that they want to pick post 
pictures about because they feel confident  

334
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:24,720
they like how they look and all of a sudden 
you have men judging them based on that  

335
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,640
whereas if i was a man and i 
posted the same kind of picture  

336
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:37,040
my responses would be dramatically different 
you don't think less of me you don't think i'm  

337
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:42,720
less professional that's just jason b and 
jason no that's called a double standard

338
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,799
it's like we forget in this industry

339
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:58,720
that women founded it women started the computer 
industry from ada lovelace who created the first  

340
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:05,759
computer program before their computers to hedy 
lamarr who created uh shortwave frequencies and  

341
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:13,440
worked on bluetooth and wi-fi and submarines as 
everybody knows her as an actress that's what  

342
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:20,960
she did the people who worked in nasa who put 
people to the moon a lot of them women of color

343
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,080
who created those programs 
who double checked the figures

344
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:36,080
back in the 70s and 80s men realized they could 
make money in this industry and that's where women  

345
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:42,000
disappeared and so now guys are like where did all 
the women go [ __ ] we took them we took them out  

346
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:49,040
you're not trying to get women into technology 
you're trying to let them come back in and  

347
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:53,840
we're not doing and and the thing is that 
we keep saying even in our phraseology  

348
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:04,400
is there's no letting they belong here we need to 
accept it it's like and you need to stop judging  

349
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:13,520
people based on their physical characteristics 
how i look does not judge me or my abilities

350
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,319
reproductive organs or lack thereof  

351
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:31,280
it's like do not make what i am i identify as a 
gender how identify with my faith or my culture  

352
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:44,160
or my country does not change in any iota what 
i know this is who you are yeah everything else  

353
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:53,839
is extra and social media is getting people 
focalized on all this instead of this

354
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,600
show me what you can do show me your actions  

355
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:10,080
show me by what you share show me who you are by 
what you know care less about what you look like

356
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:47,200
um quite frankly we do have the uh we do consider 
the users the weakest link because right now  

357
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,680
they are because we've made them that way

358
00:51:54,240 --> 00:52:03,839
i will run this by you your company your 
fictional company hires delivery drivers  

359
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,640
on day one of their job when they first start

360
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,280
do you hand them the keys and their route  

361
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,800
and tell them to go drive the 
company van and start deliveries

362
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:26,319
no you teach them you tell 
them what your rules are  

363
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:31,840
what their policies are supposed to be you tell 
them that they have to wear a seat belt every  

364
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:37,040
single time they have to do blinkers you'll 
put a sign on the back of the truck with the  

365
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:42,160
phone number if they're doing bad behavior 
or they're driving badly you put devices in  

366
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:46,879
their vehicles to monitor them to make sure 
they're not speeding you let them know that  

367
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:52,400
they have to follow traffic laws that's part of 
their job responsibility as a delivery driver

368
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,480
and if they rent that ban they will face  

369
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:06,400
penalties if a delivery driver of 
yours wrecks your van three times

370
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:17,120
will they be still your employee after the 
third time we have no problem firing that person  

371
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:19,759
from that wrecked van

372
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,000
day one someone comes to work with their job  

373
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,360
and you hand them a computer and 
you tell them there you go have fun

374
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,280
you don't tell them about the threats what 
rules they're supposed to follow for safe  

375
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:43,200
computer driving so to speak the operation of that

376
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:49,520
equipment that you just gave them 
or their responsibilities for it  

377
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:56,400
and if they jeopardize the security 
of that equipment or the network  

378
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,840
more than a certain amount of times 
then they could lose their job  

379
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:13,840
oh hold on hold on you mean if i click a bad email 
it's like more than once i'm gonna get fired i  

380
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:22,000
say soon but i say first the first time you 
click a phishing email or an actual testing  

381
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:29,120
email you get a warning and re-education 
you're forced to go back to another one-hour  

382
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:36,000
class on security awareness specialized for people 
who have made those mistakes on how to better  

383
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:41,279
look at emails how to better go through 
them show them the different simulations  

384
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:50,560
and show them the workings of why that's a problem 
the second time they do it you limit their access  

385
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:56,000
to email you actually give them some kind of 
quarantine that they have to go and then review  

386
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,360
their email goes to a different section and 
they have to send that email make it a little  

387
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:07,280
bit more difficult but safer for a month or two 
months while they're going through this process  

388
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:13,359
if they click it three they're probably an 
insider threat get them out of your company  

389
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:20,000
it's like they shouldn't be there it's like a 
delivery driver that wrecks a ban can cost you  

390
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:29,440
thousands thousands of dollars in damage to 
those vehicles target lost over 300 million  

391
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:35,520
dollars because some other employee in 
another company clicked a phishing email link

392
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,879
and we care more about delivery drivers and bans  

393
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:47,839
than your guy in accounting 
uh clicking on random emails

394
00:55:51,280 --> 00:56:00,160
thank you so much jason you rock really thank you 
i i hope to see you then the next year in chile  

395
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:06,879
and we see you in defcon definitely i would love
