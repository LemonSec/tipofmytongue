[Music]

59
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,850
a little to talk about the context

60
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:54,610
in recent years in recent years the

61
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,530
different expressions of

62
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,960
digital gender violence have raised

63
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,140
alarms both in civil society and

64
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:05,080
in international organizations and this

65
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,180
has  been motivated in large part by an

66
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,550
abandonment by the state and a

67
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,310
legislation that reflects that reality

68
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,280
in the extension and the  The intensive use

69
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,769
of mobile internet devices,

70
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:19,630
social networks such as

71
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,100
instant messaging services and

72
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,290
geolocation, as well as personal data,

73
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,810
photos, videos, etc.

74
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,080
have served as a cause for the flower

75
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,470
ife the proliferation of behaviors of

76
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,530
violence against women, proving

77
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:38,170
that  In many cases it is the Internet and its

78
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,300
services and applications are

79
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,290
also used for the purpose of controlling,

80
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,690
intimidating, harassing, humiliating and

81
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,090
blackmailing women, and this constitutes an

82
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,190
instrument that is increasingly used for

83
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,540
these purposes.

84
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,340

86
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,060
This is also due to these new threats

87
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,820
to women who are victims of violence,

88
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,980
which is explained in the first place by the

89
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,510
speed with which information is

90
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,170
disseminated in that environment and also by the

91
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,990
possibility of accessing information

92
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,390

saw it  rality the durability the lack of

96
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,680
forgetfulness in the online environment are

97
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,570
entering new risk situations

98
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:29,320
such as the access and disclosure

99
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,330

100
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,970

photographs of videos of an intimate nature

102
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,540
and also the surveillance and monitoring

103
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,760
of activities in  line

104
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,610
developed by women and also damage to the

105
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,620
reputation of women either

106
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,960
through what is written about her or the

107
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,720
use of practices such as fake

108
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,430
or behaviors known as

109
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,860
extortion and sexual harassment also

110
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,729

125
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,270
addition to another 300 complaints

126
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,699
received by the organization a vos femme which

127
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:42,800
is the association of

128

to affected women and of

135
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,080

137
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,150
educational inputs and also promoted and

due to the use of information technologies

or that this

159

and well recently in 2018 the

United Nations through the

179
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:04,279
resolution on promoting the protection and

enjoyment of human rights on the

internet expressed with concern

182
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,370
why many forms

183
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,840
of digital gaps persist between  countries,

184
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,150
but also not only between countries

185
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:21,000
but also within these countries among

186
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,610
men, women, boys and girls, and here he

187
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,010
recognized the need to close this

188
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,200
party through international cooperation

189
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,260
, he also recognized that

190
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,580
violations of women's rights

191
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,230
online are a

192
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:37,560
global concern.  increasing because it hinders

193
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,570
the exercise and

194
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,640
enjoyment of human rights and

195
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,070
freedoms on an equal footing and that

196
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,200
is precisely what can

197
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,600
persuade women to use technologies

198
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,830
and it is to that lack, let's say this flight

199
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,930
from  part of women from digital environments and

200
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,330

gender inequalities in

the protected data foundation prepared

206
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,010
a study where we worked together

207
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,420
with another organization called

208
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:21,250
amaranta on the intervention of

209
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:25,900
criminal law in this phenomenon of

210
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,580
violence  of gender on the internet in Chile

211
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,980
and what we were able to determine here, for

212
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,290
example, is that the four

213
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,450
most common types of violence in Chile on the

214
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:37,300

215
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,670
verbal attacks, mockery, insults and

reception of intimate images

219

and aggressively sexual videos as a

220
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,440
form of intimidation and 13 percent

221
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,780
were the dissemination of intimate images without

222
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,740
consent

223
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,960
where and in what

224
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,990
places this gender violence was taking place

225
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:09,380
well 71% of the attacks occurred

226

organization also amaranta

234
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,869
through this project called we are

00:11:40,869 --> 00:11:45,279
aurora also produced a report with

236
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,379
a survey on the experiences of

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,470
example, it was determined that of the

240
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:59,230

violence in digital spaces.

246
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,970
What happened after the attack here,

247
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,720
according to this report in Chile, how

248
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,490
the attack of this violent attack

249
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:35,970
on the Internet affected them was an

250
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:40,439
emotional impact in 273 cases on self-esteem

isolation  to and physical health problems

256
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,290
according to a report

257
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,449

of the year 2020 also

260
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:05,550
called what is virtual is also

261
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:08,970
real the investigation prior to the cob and 19

262
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,829
revealed several consequences of

263
00:13:10,829 --> 00:13:12,509
violence against women online

264
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:15,269
for example that some experienced

265
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:17,399
high levels of anxiety

266
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:20,189
stress disorders depression trauma

267
00:13:20,189 --> 00:13:22,319
panic attacks loss of self-esteem and a

268
00:13:22,319 --> 00:13:24,120
feeling of helplessness in their ability

269
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,160
to respond to abuse

270
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,170
these feelings may of

271
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,120
course increase in  a context of quarantine and

272
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,000
isolation throughout these

273
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,730
different waves of the pandemic

274
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,860
since women are confined to

275
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,680
their homes with additional elements to

276
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,019
economic, social and political stress and of

277
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:45,449
course there is a greater risk of

278
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:48,269
domestic violence and also the year

279
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:53,100
passed the un Chile women with

280
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,470
protected data and amaranth also got up  n

281

a survey of digital violence to

282
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,899
determine the experience of

283
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:02,639
digital violence of girls and

284

adolescents in Chile between 12 and 18 years old,

285
00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:08,819
what were some of the

286
00:14:08,819 --> 00:14:12,480
important data of this survey is

287
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,870
that if you look here 92 percent

288
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:19,079
of girls  Between 12 and 18 years old, they have

blocked unknown people or profiles

290
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,889
because they seemed

291
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:25,390

denounced or reported

296

found it offensive  aggressive or

298
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,520
inappropriate and 67 percent of

299
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,839
girls also have their

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,570
private profiles because only the people who

301
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,700
follow her can so that only the people

302

who follow her can see their content

303
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,070
of the percentage of digital violence that

adolescent girls between 15 and 18 years of age

see 24% of

310
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,620
men have experienced some experience of

311
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,390
digital violence during the pandemic,

26% of girls between 12 and 14 years have

313
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,120
suffered and indicated that it has been violence

314
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,700
and 31 percent  of girls between

boys, and 23% also with respect

317
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,230
to boys between 15 and 18 if you

318
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,420
look here in this statistic

319
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,029
of course there is a prevalence

320
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:49,000
of digital violence  against

321
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,610
women, girls and adolescents,

322
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,370
but what are the characteristics

323
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:59,149
of gender-based violence online? First,

324
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:00,620
one of the most

325
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,600
important characteristics is that there is no

326
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,850
closed catalog of behaviors and as

327
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,800
new types of

328
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,200
technology or new types of  Platforms

329
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,290
can gradually increase the way in which

330
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:15,890
concepts such as bullying and online harassment can be digitally attacked. They

331
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:18,709
do not

332
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:20,990
have unique definitions and cover

333
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:25,089
multiple behaviors.

334
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,070
see below what each one consists of and

335
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,990
although it can affect all

336
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,420
people we have already seen that they affect women in

337
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,190
a special and disproportionate way

338
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,769
and also people

339
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:39,760
of the lgtb community

340
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:42,029
of course that the characteristics of the

341
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:44,100
internet that we already discussed at  the beginning

342
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,980
can increase the effects of the

343
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,560
harmful and damaging effects on

344
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,610
the mental health of the girls and

345
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,770
that a significant number of the

346
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:58,529
aggressors are known to the real ones of

347
00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:01,320
the victim in many cases of course

348
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,760
there are also many aggressors who

349
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,740
are anonymous and  of course this

350
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,689
is also given by him due to the

351
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:11,459
anonymity of the internet so here

352
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:14,520
we see for example a way we see a

353
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,520
negative aspect also of anonymity

354
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,179
we know that anonymity is

355
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:23,099
also a positive aspect because it

356
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:25,170
allows us our freedom of expression on the

357
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,589
internet but for  On the other hand, it

358
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:31,010
is also evident that this anonymity

359
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:36,540
can increase the types of violence.

360
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,760
When we think about a typology of

361
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,680


362
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,720
online gender violence behaviors,

363
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,940
despite the fact that the development of

364
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,860
technologies may bring new

365
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,929
forms of violence, at least

366
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:52,289
we could point out that

367
00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:53,830


368
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:57,250
these types of behavior constantly exist, the

369
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,500
first being the harassment of bullying.

370
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,860
online that can of course encompass a

371
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,409
fairly wide range of conduct such

372
00:18:05,409 --> 00:18:08,140
as violent threats

373
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,929
spreading lies with the intention of damaging

374
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:14,289
the victim's reputation invasions

375
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:17,559
of privacy posting

376
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:19,510
sexually explicit images without

377
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:23,670
consent etc.

378
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,530
and therefore  can arrive at an

379
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,720
approximate definition of these concepts

380
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,210
on its own, but

381
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:33,180
the thing online can also be defined as the act of

382
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,450
intentionally causing

383
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,940
the victim an emotional discomfort that is

384
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,460
of a substantial nature through either

385
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,650
online expressions in a manner

386
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:47,640
persistent so that they are part of

387
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,000
a course of action say of ad  It is a

388
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,090
persistent act on the part of the

389
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,220
aggressor and that it is not only

390
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,759
an isolated event

391
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:01,519
of course that online harassment

392
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:04,309
can also become

393
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:08,929
cyber stocking and that what it does is that it

394
00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:11,029
allows the continuation of

395
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:13,190
physical harassment by digital means

396
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,229


397
00:19:14,229 --> 00:19:18,679
This may, for example, consist of the

398
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:21,379
repeated monitoring of a person

399
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:23,629
through the internet or through other

400
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:26,359
electronic means, including behaviors

401
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:28,399
such as sending

402
00:19:28,399 --> 00:19:33,199
unwanted communications, as we

403
00:19:33,199 --> 00:19:35,539
have seen, for example, with the sending of

404
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:39,199
unsolicited intimate images and

405
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:41,899
advances.  for example, or petitions of

406
00:19:41,899 --> 00:19:44,239
a sexual nature, threats of

407
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:47,119
violence, surveillance, monitoring

408
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,639
the location of the victim in their

409
00:19:49,639 --> 00:19:51,859
daily activities and also their

410
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:54,709
communications, the second, the second

411
00:19:54,709 --> 00:19:57,440
most widespread conduct is what is

412
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,259
called boxing, which consists

413
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:02,659
of public disclosure in a manner

414
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,490
intentional on the internet

415
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,710
of personal information about a

416
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:09,020
person  or about an individual in this

417
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,030
case a woman by a third party

418
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:14,950
with the intention of revealing the identity

419
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:18,620
of an anonymous person his

420
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,950
physical location to humiliate threaten to intimidate

421
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:25,070
or punish that person who has been

422
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:28,520
identified in third place and I believe that

423
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,910
this is a  One of the most serious types of conduct

424
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,770
is the dissemination of

425
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:37,460
intimate images without consent. Normally,

426
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,370
this type of conduct is confused

427
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:43,970
with revenge porn since by means of

428
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:47,059
which an ex-partner by herself or with third parties

429
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:48,770
distributes intimate images without the

430
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:51,740
consent of who appears in those

431
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,309
Photographs or videos in order to

432
00:20:54,309 --> 00:20:57,620
publicly humiliate her, however, it is

433
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,720
very important to point out that this

434
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,940
characterization of speaking or this

435
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,340
concept of revenge porn

436
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,950
is not the most accurate because not always

437
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:09,679
the perpetrator is an ex-partner or

438
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,990
has a without personal consent with

439
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,460


440
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,640
that woman  Many times the spirit of those who

441
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,159
disseminate a material is not revenge,

442
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:21,919
even or it is not spite and finally

443
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,960
n  or they are necessarily

444
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,820
pornographic images but they are intimate images

445
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,549


446
00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:31,269
that is why it has been proposed to use another name such

447
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:34,720
as pornography did not consent since it

448
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,179
amounts to this creation or distribution

449
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:39,610
or threat of distribution of

450
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,529
sexually explicit private material without the

451
00:21:41,529 --> 00:21:43,749
consent of the victim when it

452
00:21:43,749 --> 00:21:45,309
is  For example, threatening to

453
00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:47,320
distribute or communicate images is

454
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,419
what we can call

455
00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:53,139
extortion, as I pointed out, this is one

456
00:21:53,139 --> 00:21:54,909
of the most serious violations of the

457
00:21:54,909 --> 00:21:57,690
privacy and intimacy of a person

458
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,249
that not only affects their dignity but

459
00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:02,470
also affects their

460
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:06,369
psychological integrity and even  physical and finally

461
00:22:06,369 --> 00:22:07,960
other forms of violence online

462
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,230
massage images and includes a

463
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,720
variety of behaviors such as the sending of

464
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,330
images or videos of a sexual nature

465
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:19,239
without the consent of the recipient, the

466
00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:21,369
creation of manipulated images to

467
00:22:21,369 --> 00:22:23,230
show the victim in situations of

468
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:26,919
character  sexual denigration of them

469
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:28,450
for their physical appearance or for their

470
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:31,149
behavior and of course that this

471
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:32,889
can also include sexual extortion

472
00:22:32,889 --> 00:22:33,929


473
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:35,340
is the threat through digital media

474
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,470
to disseminate images of

475
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:41,460
an explicit sexual nature if she

476
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,169
does not comply with certain conditions or

477
00:22:43,169 --> 00:22:44,970
requires or requirements of the person who

478
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:48,730
is perpetrating this act

479
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:51,549
and well the  Online gender violence is

480
00:22:51,549 --> 00:22:54,190
one of the main causes of

481
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,650
women abandoning the internet or moderating their

482
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:01,330
speech on the internet. Here I present

483
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:06,720
this is, let's say, a list of types of

484
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,460
behaviors that we have already discussed in

485
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,040
the previous sheet but that has to

486
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,410
do with good we saw  online harassment or

487
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:16,750
cyberbullying this is as a summary the

488
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:19,270
dissemination of personal or

489
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:22,000
intimate information without consent the zinc doc the

490
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,090
use of aggressive language and insults the

491
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,610
coordinated mass attacks also the

492
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,679
monitoring surveillance the

493
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,480
hate speech against women or people from the

494
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,240
lgtb community the

495
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,770
discriminatory expressions the access have

496
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:38,049
authorized device and of course

497
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:40,800
that identity

498
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:46,050
theft usurpation or identity theft and this

499
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,999
is very important to understand

500
00:23:48,999 --> 00:23:51,099
this type of behavior is what

501
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:53,169
constitutes gender violence there are

502
00:23:53,169 --> 00:23:55,959
many women or girls who experience or

503
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:58,839
suffer this type of violence but they

504
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:02,139
are not aware of what  that what

505
00:24:02,139 --> 00:24:05,079
they are experiencing is a form of

506
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:07,160
violence

507
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,320
here a classic example

508
00:24:13,379 --> 00:24:18,238
2007 with nati's coffee

509
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:24,410
and where there was a lot of talk

510
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:30,770
that the video that was viralized by nati was

511
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,710
cataloged considered the first viral

512
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:36,500
in Chile but the truth is  that it was

513
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,280
about me I think that many of us think that it

514
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,460
is the first case of

515
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,340
digital gender violence already and that it

516
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,680
was not treated as such at least

517
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,140
by the media and the

518
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,390
rest and well what has happened  For example,

519
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:55,040
with private platforms and

520
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,020
online gender violence, when

521
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,940
we analyze how private platforms

522
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,430
address digital gender violence,

523
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,500
the outlook is not particularly

524
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,180
encouraging either.

525
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,400
In the first place, there are not very specific solutions,

526
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,100
it can be speculated that the

527
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,170
platforms either ignore the existence of the

528
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:14,030
problem or do not face it in

529
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,820
clear and well-defined terms and that implies

530
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,290
a first barrier to access to

531
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:21,020
justice, such as how a victim reported a

532
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:24,140
case, we have already seen  For example, in the

533
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,490
foundation

534
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:29,179
in particular, many cases of this type come to me

535
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:32,510
and we find, for example, that

536
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:35,330
every time a case is reported, it is not

537
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:38,929
possible to make a clear follow-up

538
00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:40,250


539
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,710
of the situation on the internet platforms, they

540
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:45,050
do not even have a

541
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:47,420
case number  assigned therefore the

542
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:52,400
follow-up of the complaint is not possible

543
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,740
or delay in time as it

544
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,870
finally enters a kind of limbo

545
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:59,990
within the platform secondly

546
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:02,720
there are solutions are solutions that

547
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,910
demand a legal domain for some

548
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,770
platforms educational skills are required

549
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,990
quite high and a

550
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:11,300
combination of legal expertise

551
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,250
to understand the terms and

552
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:15,440
conditions  ones of the service and on the other hand

553
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,420
evaluate the tool and with legal criteria

554
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,940
select the option that seems

555
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,980
most appropriate, for example when it

556
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:25,460
is a harassment or it is an

557
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,920
image that could contain, for example,

558
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,879
some type of

559
00:26:31,879 --> 00:26:34,940
intellectual right and in  thirdly, the

560
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,190
absence of linguistic diversity in

561
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,379
general, the reporting tools do not

562
00:26:39,379 --> 00:26:41,839
consider the diversity of languages, which

563
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:43,279
is a basic element for the

564
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,319
accessibility of solutions by

565
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:49,219


566
00:26:49,219 --> 00:26:51,109
the victims.

567
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:54,289
fourthly, the

568
00:26:54,289 --> 00:26:56,239
personal data and the anonymity of the

569
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:58,690
victims

570
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:01,200
because, contradictorily, in order to

571
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,560
remedy the forced de-anonymization of

572
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,300
these victims' bodies, the

573
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,190
platforms request more data

574
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:12,110
than their destination is not clear, and

575
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,480
how we combat gender violence

576
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,500
in  line well here it is important four

577
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,010
basic points the car self-care

578
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:23,960
security privacy and  l

579
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,330
consent when we talk, for

580
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:30,119
example, about self-care

581
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:31,829
and we have to ask ourselves the following

582
00:27:31,829 --> 00:27:35,639
questions, how much time did I spend online and

583
00:27:35,639 --> 00:27:38,749
in which social networks am I participating?

584
00:27:38,749 --> 00:27:41,759


585
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:45,089


586
00:27:45,089 --> 00:27:49,169


587
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:51,779
that

588
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:54,719
these devices make, I know what

589
00:27:54,719 --> 00:27:56,549
their qualities are, their properties, what

590
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:59,549
aspects could fail in those

591
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:01,979
devices, my devices are

592
00:28:01,979 --> 00:28:05,389
functional to my uses and why

593
00:28:05,389 --> 00:28:08,029
when we also think about doing this

594
00:28:08,029 --> 00:28:10,639
analysis regarding security, it

595
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:13,519
must be borne in mind if I have,

596
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:16,009
for example, checked the configuration of  my

597
00:28:16,009 --> 00:28:18,169
devices and the applications that

598
00:28:18,169 --> 00:28:20,779
I have installed as

599
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:24,049
my profiles in social networks are configured if

600
00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:25,579
the security mechanisms

601
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:27,829
for the accounts have been activated and this is a very very

602
00:28:27,829 --> 00:28:30,169
important many of the cases that come to us

603
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:32,499


604
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,320
are cases in which the

605
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,330
security measures of  the personal accounts that

606
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:39,580
are all  Our digital assets do not

607
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,950
have basic security measures

608
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:45,370
such as two-

609
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,130
step authentication or double factor authentication,

610
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:50,380
which are very important because if

611
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:53,170
anyone has

612
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:55,780
unauthorized access to a social network account

613
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:58,810
or an email, the fact

614
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:03,700
having a registration in another factor

615
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,060
another factor of security for access

616
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,800
allows in the background to protect that account

617
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:13,330
that account or digital asset

618
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:15,460
I also have to ask myself if I have the same

619
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:18,280
password for all that also comes to

620
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,530
be an aspect to combat this

621
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:21,640
violence

622
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,550
I have  backups of my information because it

623
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,650
is important for me to respond to support

624
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:28,930
the information I do not know here it is also a bit

625
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:31,870
of thinking and analyzing all the

626
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,090
information that our devices have,

627
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:36,230


628
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:38,179
all the personal information, be it

629
00:29:38,179 --> 00:29:40,040
photography or other information

630
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,590
that could be of a sensitive nature  and

631
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,780
also think for how long I

632
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,370
keep the information before

633
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,350
destroying  The because of course that the

634
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,750
information as long as it is not destroyed can

635
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,059
be kept indefinitely in

636
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:54,679
the different devices that we

637
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:57,350
maintain and with respect to privacy

638
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:01,190
it is also important to analyze what

639
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:05,419
information I have, where information is stored,

640
00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:07,890


641
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:11,610
how accessible or public or

642
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:14,310
confidential that information is

643
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,230
who has access to that information there are

644
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,970
many cases, for example also of this

645
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:20,850
survey of the united nations, of or not

646
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:23,520
women in chile of the amount a

647
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,990
significant percentage of adolescents

648
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:30,420
shared their access code or their

649
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:33,390
passwords that this type of information

650
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:35,610
published in  my social networks and how much

651
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:37,680
of my life and my environment is

652
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,300
available on the internet since this

653
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,220
would also be a kind of an

654
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:45,360
analysis of how I am handling how

655
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,010
we are handling our information on the

656
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:49,170
internet that is why it is always important to

657
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:53,670
be searching in google in case  there is

658
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:55,320
private information that

659
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,220
was circulating

660
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:03,159
o and fourthly the consent and

661
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:05,950
here the consent relates to

662
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:08,200
what information content I am sharing

663
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,899
with who I share it if I am aware

664
00:31:10,899 --> 00:31:13,659
of the things in which I can be

665
00:31:13,659 --> 00:31:16,299
tagged online

666
00:31:16,299 --> 00:31:18,789
content or information was exchanged with someone I

667
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:20,559
know how it is stored  on your

668
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,289
device and if necessary, perhaps

669
00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:25,149
indicate specification in that

670
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:27,190
information exchange that is why it is

671
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:29,830
very important to know the terms and

672
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:33,129
conditions to know the rules of the

673
00:31:33,129 --> 00:31:35,109
community standards of the platform in

674
00:31:35,109 --> 00:31:37,149
relation to the information that I am

675
00:31:37,149 --> 00:31:39,029
sharing and when that information

676
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:42,190
stops  be under the control of

677
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:44,750
ourselves

678
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:48,830
and finally think a little about the

679
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,810
holistic security strategy since

680
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,700
this is a diagram that was created by

681
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,850
tactical tactics the tec which is a

682
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:58,030


683
00:31:58,169 --> 00:32:01,830
non-profit organization with which it is based

684
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:06,059
in germany and they published  this

685
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:09,389
holistic guide here is also indicated

686
00:32:09,389 --> 00:32:13,320
the link where they can access and distinguish

687
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,830
In this holistic security three types

688
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:19,499
of security physical security on the one

689
00:32:19,499 --> 00:32:23,369
hand that deals with our

690
00:32:23,369 --> 00:32:25,919
physical integrity in our homes

691
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,259
in places in vehicles etc.

692
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:31,649
a psychosocial security that has to

693
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:33,960
do with our psychological well-being and

694
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,499
digital security about what it is about

695
00:32:37,499 --> 00:32:39,059
About our information, our

696
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:40,769
communications and our teams,

697
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:43,379
then all this holistic analysis of

698
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:46,679
strategy is also established with

699
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:49,889
strategies and some tactics, this

700
00:32:49,889 --> 00:32:51,929
also in conjunction with others with other

701
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:53,070
initiatives that it also has

702
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,960
tactically that I also invite you to

703
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,409
know what is called data of toks that

704
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:00,050
It is a kind

705
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:05,900
of detoxification on data issues of

706
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,310
all the information that we are

707
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:10,990
sharing on the internet,

708
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:14,590
well I want to leave the exhibition up to here

709
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,940
to give space to the

710
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,070
conversation or the questions that

711
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:23,270
the people in whom they have attended

712
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,250
each conference have  and

713
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,560
maybe talk about some of him  The cases of

714
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,720
some of the some queries that they

715
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,940
have in relation to these behaviors

716
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:35,000
what happens in Chile in Latin America

717
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,320
so today available for them, well

718
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,190
the talk, the truth is that because in the

719
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,480
field there were many things that they did not

720
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,440
know and not many times  It does not

721
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,309
really measure what happens on the Internet,

722
00:33:52,309 --> 00:33:54,480
probably we who work on

723
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,120
this know we know a little more about the

724
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,740
risks that exist on the Internet than what

725
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,690
people are exposed to, but in this

726
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:02,460
particular case of gender, the truth

727
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:05,730
is that I did not know so much, I asked questions about

728
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:07,780
In fact,

729
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,730
here is one, for example, Roberto says

730
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:12,920
how do you think we could encourage

731
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,360
users to apply methods to know others

732
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,980
regarding the information they share

733
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,120
because of course I believe that Carlos, a

734
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,560
user, I always say it in my

735
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,989
talks also with users of

736
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:25,670
social networks mainly  We are very

737
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,320
responsible for the information that we

738
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,699
share, one of the main

739
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:31,149
responsible parties,

740
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:37,060
yes I think it is super important  What,

741
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,150
beyond self-care, which of

742
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:42,120
course is important here, there

743
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,489
is also a responsibility of the state to

744
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:46,650
establish public policies

745
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:49,290
to protect people. We think that is

746
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:52,199
why I started by pointing out that this is

747
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:55,600
about human rights

748
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,760
and international

749
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,920
rights law.  Therefore, the state

750
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,400
has to

751
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,190
guarantee the balance exercise

752
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:08,220
for both women and men on

753
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,859
an equal footing, but not only

754
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:12,540
are states obliged to comply with

755
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,190
these standards, platforms are also obliged,

756
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:16,320
companies

757
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,480
must also apply it and therefore  They must both

758
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,660
establish

759
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:24,000
mechanisms that allow guaranteeing a

760
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,340
space free of violence

761
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,910
and this, as it is increasing, is all this

762
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:32,760
currently, let's say I think it is an issue

763
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,890
that has been increasing and where it is being

764
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:37,020
approached from different ways, that is,

765
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,540
not only from the user.  only

766
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,180
from self-care also from other

767
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,920
organizations or other agencies that

768
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,600
have something to say, such as

769
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,070
data protection authorities,

770
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:51,780
because any type of act where

771
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:55,260
the privacy or

772
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:59,090
protection of the data of these women is public is affected

773
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,040
also implies a violation of their

774
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,080
right to privacy and personal data

775
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,850


776
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:08,300
in  That sense in Chile as we are

777
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,800
regarding public policy or

778
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:16,170
related legislation, look at the year 2020

779
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:20,820
, a last bill

780
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,460
on digital violence was presented, what happened

781
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,200
and before that one had already been presented

782
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,090
by the executive, this last project

783
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:30,020
of 2020 was presented by  A group of

784
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:33,020
parliamentarians

785
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,490
and in Latin America there are many

786
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:37,410
countries that are legislating, perhaps

787
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:40,620
some not as completely as

788
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,810
we saw, for example with all these cases

789
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:45,300
of non-consensual dissemination of

790
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,490
images and harassment of online harassment

791
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:49,110
as if  They have other other

792
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,670
laws, Spain does not have

793
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,560
established in its penal code and the

794
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,540
penalties are criminal,

795
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,730
let's say.  constitute crimes and

796
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:00,030
therefore the penalties are associated with

797
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:02,490
custodial sentences in Latin America

798
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:05,780
Mexico has advanced a lot around the

799
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:08,550
rules for the non-consensual dissemination of

800
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,080
images on purpose a well-

801
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,420
known case that is from Olympia, then the

802
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:15,000
Olympian law that are thoroughly approved  In

803
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,560
all the in all the federated states

804
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:21,480
of Mexico it has already allowed to have a

805
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,210
legislation Peru does not also have but

806
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:27,390
it is pending to dictate its own

807
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:28,590
legislation on

808
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:31,440
digital violence in terms of public policies

809
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,060
the truth is that I know I do not know

810
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,340
initiative for  part of the state in

811
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,200
terms of digital violence and on the other

812
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,269
hand when we see for example

813
00:37:39,269 --> 00:37:42,089
or in what situation both the

814
00:37:42,089 --> 00:37:43,679
investigating police and the

815
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:47,489
prosecutor's office are, many of

816
00:37:47,489 --> 00:37:50,459
the victims who are going to report

817
00:37:50,459 --> 00:37:53,550
cases of violence

818
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:56,160
are not received their complaints

819
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:01,590
therefore there is no record of some type

820
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,630
of typology because as there is no

821
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,950
criminal type

822
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,720
Many of the complaints in the background

823
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,420
are nothing or are classified as

824
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,090
in another type of crime such as

825
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:15,900
domestic violence or some type

826
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,240
of computer crime if

827
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,319
that hypothesis could occur

828
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,849
and with respect to social networks for

829
00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:27,190
example what is your opinion  That there

830
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,869
is one that can be considered

831
00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:30,849
safer than another because it offers you more

832
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:32,770
guarantees

833
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:36,190
in terms of digital violence.Look

834
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,230
lately what we have seen is that

835
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,480
internet platforms, at least

836
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,310
the big ones, the most important social networks

837
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:45,400
are opening

838
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,990
information spaces for by  For different

839
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:52,630
types of violence, for example, if

840
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,360
Facebook has it and is there and provides

841
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,240
information, for example, as in conjunction

842
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,060
with some

843
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,770
civil society organizations that are the ones that are addressing

844
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:05,020
this issue, finally, civil society

845
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,390
is the one that has been allowing this to

846
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:11,460
and from  making violence visible on the internet

847
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,650
but every day others are being added, for

848
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:18,730
example lately I learned that  He

849
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:23,680
also dictated to open a kind of

850
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,960
security committee where there are also

851
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,720
people who are representing in that

852
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,180
security committee and who

853
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,640
also represent Mexican civil societies,

854
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,220
for example on issues of digital issues

855
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,490


856
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:39,530
and violence and on the other hand, for example,

857
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:44,390
look at  I have also had to

858
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:47,960
coordinate together with another colleague from Costa

859
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,100
Rica in a project on

860
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,470
digital gender violence for Latin America and what

861
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:56,540
she seeks is to strengthen the strategies

862
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,100
of the data protection authorities

863
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,369
in the matter of digital violence in

864
00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:03,920
fact in the last  updating of the

865
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,980


866
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,109
data protection and privacy

867
00:40:08,109 --> 00:40:12,010
principles of the oas we were able to include the aspects

868
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,990
of digital violence within these

869
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:16,359
principles therefore we are giving

870
00:40:16,359 --> 00:40:18,340
a gender approach to data protection

871
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,369
through the consecration of

872
00:40:21,369 --> 00:40:23,590
this type of phenomenon in  these

873
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,039
principles

874
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:29,769
ok ok look several questions came

875
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,080
well this a question a bit technical

876
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,460
but  Or do you also handle the matter? It

877
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,530
says how we could promote at the

878
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:39,540
government level with both national

879
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:42,090
authentication, it is difficult for me to

880
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:45,210
imagine adolescents using them considering

881
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:48,800
the only useful that of course

882
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,860
well that I think is simply

883
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:55,170
information and training in

884
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:57,210
cybersecurity capabilities  for children and

885
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:59,850
adolescents and that should be of

886
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:01,950
well-being this public policy lesson

887
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:04,530
I believe that one thing the first thing that

888
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:07,230
should be established in Chile as they

889
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:10,970
have done in some countries is to

890
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:14,030


891
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,200
formally establish in the law

892
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:24,700
a chair, let's say a branch within that

893
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:30,300
of  the educational curricular mesh

894
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,609
digital education and that and in that

895
00:41:33,609 --> 00:41:35,320
digital education is that

896
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,150
all these aspects

897
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:40,150
of privacy cybersecurity are contemplated, that is, that is essential and

898
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:42,910
today there is no branch as mandatory,

899
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:45,550
I explain myself, I think you have to

900
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:47,520
start there as if to  oblige all

901
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,599
educational establishments to do so in

902
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,730
addition to other public policies that

903
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:54,339
may be impl  In the meantime,

904
00:41:54,339 --> 00:41:57,369
I imagine that the support to the

905
00:41:57,369 --> 00:41:59,589
civil society organizations that you,

906
00:41:59,589 --> 00:42:02,050
Gabriel, know a lot in which we

907
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:03,460
participate and that we are working

908
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:06,400
to also educate in digital matters and

909
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,290
that is the aspects of the double

910
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:10,900
authentication factor is essential, it is as

911
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,510
we say it is a  basic along with

912
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:16,839
password for digital security of

913
00:42:16,839 --> 00:42:18,519
course but I think we cannot

914
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:21,640
wait for people to know how to use a

915
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,229
teenager or someone of the third age

916
00:42:23,229 --> 00:42:25,869
if it has never been explained to them how exact

917
00:42:25,869 --> 00:42:28,299
we also discussed it with jason at

918
00:42:28,299 --> 00:42:30,009
first it can not be  demand from

919
00:42:30,009 --> 00:42:32,319
someone who ended up using the

920
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,479
internet if you never told him what it was for

921
00:42:34,479 --> 00:42:36,600
as his salvation,

922
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:41,730
look at several they tell us that we are in charge

923
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,380
with the issue of data protection

924
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:46,080
that you see that could help to

925
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,610
correct and restore trust by

926
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:50,100
thinking about  all in the attacks

927
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,080
associated with data spoofing their

928
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,120
identity where the victim feels

929
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,200
alone and without support

930
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,010
what happens is that today they are re  glas

931
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,170
are not clear if the problem is one of the

932
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:04,210
great problems of steel is that as

933
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:06,460
there is no legislation with an

934
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,560
authorship that can control to sanction

935
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,260
any type of d

936
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:14,040
[Music]

937
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,680
of infringement of the law on

938
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,710
data that gives the arbitration in  The bottom line is that

939
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:23,310
first to what a victim can do

940
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:26,550
a victim in his right in courts

941
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:28,740
of justice and not before an authority that

942
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:31,230
could ensure compliance with the

943
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:33,210
law and sanction and supervise etc.

944
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:36,540
then that is the first thing I think that

945
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,770
here what  There is

946
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:40,200
no political or political will, I mean both the

947
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,000
legislature, the legislators and the

948
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:42,960
executive

949
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,330
with the amount of time in which

950
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:48,240
this type of norms have been discussed, stretch

951
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,190
when, as I have seen it countless

952
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:53,400
times, with the scope of technological penetration

953
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,550
in Chile and  if we compare it

954
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:59,700
with and the implementation of 5g we are

955
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,920
legislating on neuro rights etc.

956
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,320
but in parallel

957
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,900
we do not have one yet we do not use the

958
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:10,020
law of crimes i  Computer scientists do not have

959
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,610
a decent data protection law

960
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:13,860
or an authorship that ensures that I

961
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:16,890
believe that here in responsibility it is

962
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:19,200
the political responsibility of the

963
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,640
legislators and the executive, here a

964
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,930
good question that I do not know the

965
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:26,480
answer

966
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,760
or any penalty for the  Responsible for the

967
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,190
case of no one

968
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:36,230
yes yes a good penalty because in the

969
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:39,440
boys who released those images those

970
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,300
videos were minors at that

971
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:44,359
time so what was done was

972
00:44:44,359 --> 00:44:46,099
civil lawsuits civil lawsuits were sued

973
00:44:46,099 --> 00:44:48,940
for extra-contractual liability

974
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:51,290
she later obtained in the supreme court

975
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:53,710


976
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,720
But he ordered the payment of compensation

977
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:02,150
to the parents of the perpetrators,

978
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:04,160
let's say of the perpetrators of those

979
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,520
who published the video and a fine

980
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,130
to an amount of compensation for

981
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:13,280
moral damage of 30 million pesos. Now that

982
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,830
case is one of the  cases that we know as

983
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:18,110
the one that has established a higher penalty

984
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:21,470
but the case of nati did not come only to

985
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:24,170
kisses to her years later she had to

986
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:26,600
pr  to present a protection resource, well

987
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,370
she first, in addition to all this, that is

988
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:29,630
why I have the stigmatization is very

989
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:30,380
great

990
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:33,320
nati was expelled from school and after being

991
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,900
expelled from school she had to

992
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,360
leave the city and go with her family

993
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,580
to another city to build a road  The new one

994
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,590
had to change her name,

995
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:47,320


996
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:49,740


997
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:54,090


998
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:56,580


999
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:57,630


1000
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:00,869


1001
00:46:00,869 --> 00:46:04,170


1002
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:06,270
etc.  ten years

1003
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:08,609
later that is why I say the impacts

1004
00:46:08,609 --> 00:46:10,559
it can have and here for all

1005
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:12,750
the parents who are listening to

1006
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:15,540
this talk the importance of this

1007
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:18,420
digital education to girls and also

1008
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,970
to boys because finally

1009
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:22,890
gender violence in the

1010
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:27,359
It does is how to replicate machismo and what

1011
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,849
we see in the real too and this is

1012
00:46:29,849 --> 00:46:32,430
virtual and as we already said the real

1013
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:34,950
also the virtual term is real

1014
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:37,049
so definitively  Well, they ask you if

1015
00:46:37,049 --> 00:46:39,930
there are spaces or organizations that

1016
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,940
educate privacy on the internet for the

1017
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:45,000
good adolescent child, we try to do

1018
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,510
something in 8.8 obviously late

1019
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:50,970
and we also in the protected data foundation

1020
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:53,310
that is a

1021
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,110
frozen communication I want an organization that

1022
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:56,880
promotes privacy and data also

1023
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,550
ours  The purpose is to educate in

1024
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:01,590
privacy and data and in

1025
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:05,520
digital security that today and especially today

1026
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,690
with the pandemic is essential without a

1027
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:11,100
digital native foundation is also

1028
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,740
committed to the xi protected data

1029
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:16,110
point heretic our our

1030
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:20,820
excellent and good site they speak that there should

1031
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:23,340
be an obligation to  Some of the

1032
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,950
companies also with regard to regulating

1033
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:27,810
cases of digital violence, I do not know

1034
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:30,200
how the issue is at the business level, there is

1035
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,510
awareness of responsibility or they also take

1036
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:34,800
refuge in the fact that there is no legislation,

1037
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,530
so they are not sent, not the truth is

1038
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:39,270
that they are a little bit up to me.  a

1039
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:43,290
recent case of a shipment in a in a

1040
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:45,970
company sending u  na

1041
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:48,580
of an email with an

1042
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:52,770
intimate photo of one of the workers

1043
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:56,260
and of course what is hardly

1044
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:58,840
published this is sent as a lot of

1045
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:03,510
workers what they did was

1046
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:08,050
immediately say that the person who

1047
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:11,980
was in the sender sorry that they had

1048
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:14,800
sent by the reviewer of the issuer of the

1049
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,410
email had not been from him

1050
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:19,060
but had been in the background an

1051
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:20,920
access they have authorized this email and

1052
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:23,650
therefore it was then as finally to

1053
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,780
warn that it was not the person who

1054
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:30,010
had published the image but they

1055
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:33,260
were not  as he recognized an exact attack

1056
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:36,119
but on the other hand not clear

1057
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:40,470
and only to give a solution or not to give support to

1058
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:43,380
the victim, that is, finally, he already says and

1059
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:45,990
what support they did not take, they did not take

1060
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:50,010
any action in relation to her, that

1061
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,200
is, it was a warning to say today  This person

1062
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,000
who appears to have sent it, he did not go

1063
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,840
and then it was like then there also

1064
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,300
in the work spaces and also on the

1065
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:02,430
occasion of teleworking, situations are occurring

1066
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:04,920
It is about violence, there is

1067
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,610
also a study, a survey that was

1068
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:12,060
recently published by the

1069
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:13,920
online bullying project so that I

1070
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,170
also invite you to review the online bullying point

1071
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:18,000
is not a

1072
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,750
Latin American initiative

1073
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:23,460
created by pas peña where there is a lot of

1074
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:27,600
information on how to save the

1075
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,000
evidence in case of violence how to

1076
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,220
report what are the rules that

1077
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:35,550
can help you carry

1078
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:37,410
out a complaint in the different

1079
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:39,000
countries of Latin America and this other

1080
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,860
liked in different languages in Spanish

1081
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:44,310
in Portuguese also in English is

1082
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:47,070
quite incredible online bullying point  his

1083
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:48,660
incredible talk of information that

1084
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:51,180
people in ecstasy gave us and who

1085
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:53,190
are very impressed with the figure and

1086
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:55,110
incredible with this topic is a little

1087
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:57,990
known and with many times we

1088
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:01,710
even go from being between victims and

1089
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:03,420
perpetrators, people do not realize that

1090
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,730
this  happens and ultimately we let them

1091
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:07,560
continue to happen so it is super good to

1092

00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:22,200
against women and the lgtb community

1098
