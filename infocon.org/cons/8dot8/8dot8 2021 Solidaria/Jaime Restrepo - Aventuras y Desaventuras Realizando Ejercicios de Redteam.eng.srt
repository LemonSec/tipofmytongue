1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,360
I like it

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,170
well

[Music]

6
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,580
Thank you very much everyone for staying

7
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,280
connected we know that we are

8
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,570
increasingly flooded with virtual events as

9
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,100
you can see here my zombie friend has just joined

10
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,190
and I am with the great

11
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:33,330
Jaime Restrepo friend  8.8 staff and

12
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,460
the truth is that we wanted to end in

13
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,050
this luxurious way with Jaime

14
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,030
accompanying him because you already

15
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,340
know Jaime probably the majority and

16
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,200
we also with the commitment this

17
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,960
hacker crusade that helps the

18
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,300
ice age and Chile I already said it  Well, so it

19
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,530
appeared, it has been an incredible day,

20
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,570
I think we are going to try to add to the

21
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,369
end of the conference the fact that he did a

22
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:59,160
little while to be told about the

23
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,080
contributions and that, but we are very happy

24
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,320
because we know that the virtual often complicates

25
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,180


26
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,650
the  participation of

27
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,810
people etc. especially now that

28
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,370
we have so many virtual events but

29
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,720
despite that we have had very good

30
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,170
contributions so zombies welcome to 8.8

31
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,680
solidarity and also agents if I join

32
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,239
to be able to close it later

33
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:22,800
unfortunately I will not count on you

34
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,800
so I have to turn off the light but

35
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,590
before that have the main chip that

36
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,989
jaime tripita nin grande so you can

37
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:32,400
tell us a little about your misadventures that is

38
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,750
part  what we are going to talk about

39
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,320
today so nothing gabriel before

40
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,380
everything begins thanks that we are going to

41
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,200
release that we are going to leave free so that

42
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,340
you can continue with your

43
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,060
natural tasks of the day we

44
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,920
appreciate the hours of transmission and

45
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,930
in parallel we give you  welcome

46
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,360
Jaime and we also give him the space

47
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,340
to start immediately now

48
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,370

the truth is that I am delighted here to film

52
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,400
with you and more for a good cause

53
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,120
like the one  He has us gathered here,

54
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,709
he was always willing to collaborate with

55
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:13,170
you and with the entire Chilean community,

56
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,730
which has always received me very well in

57
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:19,470
part of the house.

58
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,570
Inside the habit of enjoying jaime,

59
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,790
how many times has it been in 8.8 or

60
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,280
have you already forgotten?

61
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,860


62
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,200


63
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,900


64
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,880


65
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,910
Peru yes then

66

00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,070
x world public inbox

70
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,830
world hacker willow lab is going to do us at 8.8 for

71
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,890
the contributions and blogs vision and jaime this

72
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,010
scenario of  8.8 solidarity is all yours

share everything, here is a screen for a

75
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,130
moment, remember to write down all

76
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,660
your doubts or take note because

77
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,030
depending on the country, answer the

78
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,150
word so that we have a

79
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,920
question and answer session that will surely

80
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,660
go  to stay with many at the end of the

81
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,959
talk I leave you then here he said on the

82
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,480
screen very good morning, afternoon or evening

83
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,430
depending on the time and place from

84
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,470
Where this talk is being lived today

85
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,669
we are going to see the adventures and misadventures

86
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:26,070
that I had with my work team

87
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,590
doing that is, of reptile, my name

88
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,230
is Jaime Restrepo, a Colombian union of

89
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,090
telecommunications systems that has

90
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,100
been working in the world for more than 15 years  Of

91
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,690
computer security,

92
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,490
most of the speakers would stop

93
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,500
here to talk about it, but since

94
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,440
we only have 20 minutes, we are going to the important thing,

95
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,840


96
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,550
surely many of you know me

97
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,840
for having founded the community of

98
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,850
needles, a community that has been online for

99
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,949
more than 19 years contributing to the  world of

100
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:53,720
computer security and that is

101
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,490
considered one of the most relevant in

102
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,320
the sector in it you will find a lot of

103
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,850
free information to start in the

104
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,530
world of computer security in

105
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,030
text articles but also on

106
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,770
our youtube channel this channel

107
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,389
has quickly become  one of the

108
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:06,919
biggest on this subject of

109
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:08,300
our language

110
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,889
only if we look at it from the bottom

111
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:11,810
up  but surely with your

112
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,729
subscription and bell this is going to

113
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:16,160
change soon I also want to

114
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,450
invite you to the dragon maple asked you to be

115
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,889
satisfied it is a computer security congress

116
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:20,780
that we do every year

117
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,910
in the month of September we have eight

118
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,950
uninterrupted editions and right

119
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,870
now we have the papers open for

120
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,760
that you can participate by sending your

121
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,350


122
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,790
research most of the computer security talks

123
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,980
start with a warning and

124
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,140
this could not be the exception the

125
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,550
first of them I already told you we have

126
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,620
only 20 minutes the second

127
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,420
warning is that many of the

128
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,160
images that you are going to see  Here and the

129
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,050
contents that I am going to show you are

130
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,820
taken from real auditing processes,

131
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,740
therefore many of the contents

132
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,960
will be censored and blocked to

133
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,040
protect the identity of the people

134
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,840
who participate in it and the companies

135
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,060
involved and last but not

136
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,280
least  that all the comments that

137
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,750
I make in this talk are entirely

138
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,420
irresponsibility and I know that many of

139
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,790
them can hurt susceptibilities

140
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,820
like what is it like this

141
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,210
we are talking about reptile or it

142
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,180
is simply a 25 the scope of both and

143
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,040
lately the term reptile was being used a lot

144
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,840
as if it were a

145
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,160
novelty in the world of security

146
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,710
computer science but many years

147
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,380
ago reptile was already made without being classified as

148
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,960
such with this term in fact it made me

149
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,330
curious and I began to look in

150
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,460
google search results from

151
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,950
when

152
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,830
the term reptile associated with

153
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,840
the  computer security and we see that

154
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,540
approximately in 2014

155
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,300
an upward trend in

156
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,100
searches related to this term begins,

157
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,320
it does not mean that before 2014 they did not

158
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,110
do a reptile exercise in fact the

159
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,290
nickerson crisis team already in 2007

160
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,480
carried out for the program

161
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,570
cable television- trutv in the usa a special

162
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,880
with two episodes where he was

163
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,400
shown with his team of tr  down he managed to

164
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,930
jump the barriers of

165
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,150
computer security and physical security in

166
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,120
different maximum security environments

167
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,729
without going very far in 2012

168
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:15,620
in an event of a colleague who has

169
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,120
just destroyed the house called Álvaro

170
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,710
Andrade published an investigation

171
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,979
entitled bridges in the era  post-pc where it

172
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:25,400
will show how the post-pc trend

173
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,080
that occurs both at the time that basically

174
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,659
consisted of leaving

175
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:33,020
desktop computers for mobile computers and

176
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,199
tablets could be used to

177
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,849
favor our pen

178
00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:40,580
testing exercises and how we use  this trend

179
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,770
of microcomputers and different

180
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,599
elements to perform

181
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:46,520
textile pen exercises in whose scope we would be

182
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,719
allowed social engineering

183
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:49,550
attacks and attacks on physical security

184
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,099
I invite you to see the

185
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:54,199
nickerson crisis program and the talk that I

186
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,939
am commenting here with  the qr codes

187
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:58,580
that I leave you in the slides so that you

188
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,229
find out a little more facts although in

189
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,120
this talk  As such, we are going to see some

190
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,649
of the videos that were used at that

191
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,220
time.

192
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,050
Well then, what is the difference

193
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,350
between a reptile and a wide-range 25?

194
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,270
The main difference between a

195
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,550
wide-range 25 and an

196
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,370
active climbing exercise in testing we have to

197
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,170
find.  As many problems as

198
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,820
possible that may affect the

199
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,980
organization, while the

200
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,060
reptile exercise

201
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,010
we can use any means to

202
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,930
fulfill our objective, which is usually

203
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,850
very specific and we do not necessarily

204
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:32,099
have to find all the

205
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:35,030
security problems that the organization has

206
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,130
in the two exercises.  use

207
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,980
methodologies like the one you see on the screen

208
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,659
where we go through different phases such as

209
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:42,610
the collection of information,

210
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,530
enumeration, analysis, exploitation and post-

211
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:48,140
exploitation, finally a documentation

212
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,060
but we are not going to focus much on

213
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,130
this methodology since it has a link that

214
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,170
appears below work point education

215
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,360
you are going to  find a free course

216
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,730
where you  e we teach point by point

217
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,320
each of these phases and how you can

218
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,810
use this methodology in your day-to-

219
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:05,920
day life as a print

220
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,149
tester. Normally, it is in the numbering

221
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:09,740
and recognition phase. Identify more

222
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,420
people who work in the organization

223
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,700
because they are related to it.

224
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,350
very well what are your

225
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,750
tastes, hobbies and all this then

226
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,490
let's look for user generation patterns

227
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,930
for corporate emails

228
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,120
suddenly leaked passwords in

229
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,459
different information all the

230
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:27,230
inputs that will serve us to

231
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,970
brute force such as personal data

232
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,220
important dates and any amount

233
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,990
of  information that can serve us here

234
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,149
we rely a lot on all

235
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:37,010
god time techniques in order to

236
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,839
review attacks directed to

237
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:40,279
email known as spirit

238
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,709
fishing or directly to

239
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:44,720
identified telephone numbers also known

240
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,140
as disney without these attacks it is difficult

241
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,269
normally they tend to be very  effective since

242
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:52,300
they were very di  Rigid to the

243
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,649
specific personnel to whom we already carry out all

244
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:56,690
the research, it will attack their

245
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:01,070
tastes, affinities, hobbies, etc. and

246
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,300
normally requires that we

247
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,160
register a domain to use it

248
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,200
as an excuse for the purpose of

249
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,089
downloading a document or a

250
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:09,410
file.

251
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,449


252
00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:14,060
They are recently created and normally do not

253
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,529
pass the filters of the antispam systems,

254
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:17,629
therefore I recommend

255
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:19,490
registering a domain similar to the

256
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,079
organization, if it is an audit that

257
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,610
the organization usually does on a

258
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,740
recurring basis, the domain is recommended

259
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,839
that it is not less than a year old and they can

260
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:28,699
help each other.  of tools such as

261
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:30,410
crazy's google to identify domains

262
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,569
similar to the organization, I also

263
00:10:32,569 --> 00:10:34,519
recommend that you always use

264
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:36,290
dedicated servers to carry out this

265
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,910
type of attack because we do not know

266
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,160
when the fish will bite the bait and we

267
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,389
need a Serbian to be

268
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:44,089
dependent on each bait  for that attack to be

269
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:45,829
very effective  I recommend

270
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:47,779
using services such as digital

271
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:49,970
option, here I leave you the coupon hundreds

272
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,230
of times so that you can start with them

273
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,509
but also that the domain register

274
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:55,160
with something generic that can be used

275
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,079
in many companies such as something

276
00:10:57,079 --> 00:10:59,269
related to electronic invoicing

277
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:01,009
in Colombia  It works very well but

278
00:11:01,009 --> 00:11:02,629
surely for other countries

279
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:04,790
we will have some generic excuses that

280
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,470
can work quite well also

281
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,569
something that I recommend is that

282
00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:10,310
the domain registration also in cloud

283
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,030
flare so that it can generate

284
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:15,240
free ssl certificate and in this way

285
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,220
try to jump to the maximum  the

286
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,780
antispam filters that organizations can have

287
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,180
the protest that we can

288
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,820
raise in this directed mail can

289
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,050
vary between person and person

290
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,870
identified, the most effective thing that

291
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,420
has been for us is the download

292
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,460
of office files

293
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,100
sometimes we do a two-for-one and

294
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,650
put  this download on

295
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:40,170
samba servers specially way  two so that

296
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,810
when they download the files that at the

297
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,430
end comes with a payloader inside,

298
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,340
as in turn they are leaving us some

299
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,440
hashes that we could use at the

300
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,000
moment that we have access to

301
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,830
the organization here, it is very important

302
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,450
that we do not put any people

303
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,310
inside the one of the  files but we

304
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,860
use a small pay what we

305
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,400
do is download our people to

306
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,230
receive we have to the maximum the detection

307
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,240
of any security software that

308
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,410
may have

309
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,329
it is also advisable to feel

310
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:12,879
like communicating with the victim with some

311
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:14,889
pretext related to their  position within the

312
00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:16,959
organization with an active purpose of

313
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,399
becoming mail and we can identify

314
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,490
signatures or metadata in the documents and

315
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,899
we ask for example a quote

316
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:25,269
that can help us to better define

317
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:27,519
what would be the best way to compromise

318
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,100
your device the choice of people

319
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,019
who we  would allow remote access

320
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:34,060
is also very important here I

321
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,029
recommend using the mat  riz c2, which

322
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:38,889
is basically a list with a large

323
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:40,720
amount of remote administration software

324
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,930
with different functionalities,

325
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,699
I highly recommend using the most

326
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:48,250
current ones, the less known ones, to try

327
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,410
as I said to avoid detection as much as possible

328
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,089
with the same purpose of

329
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:54,430
avoiding detection. I also recommend

330
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,930
send the emails manually

331
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,790
because we have identified in some

332
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,069
scenarios that signatures are generated on

333
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:02,050
the emails and with this I am

334
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,420
too much it already generates an alert about a

335
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,819
malicious email automatically

336
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,889
the emails very similar to the one

337
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:11,199
that was announced are deleted and when we carry out

338
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:12,699
this process  manual and using the

339
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:14,050
tools of the same

340
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,500
hosting provider as we avoid to the maximum the

341
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,660
mass manufacturing of the

342
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,880
emails that normally

343
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,370
make it easy to sign these quickly

344
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,220
if it is not possible to carry out this

345
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,019
customization normally because the

346
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:32,319
number of emails to send is massive, it is

347
00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:34,120
recommended  Useful  To raise some framework, the

348
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,920
best known and most used is go

349
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,470
phising,

350
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,510
but here we try to put as

351
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,490
many variables as possible in

352
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,140
order that the emails are

353
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,340
very similar, I

354
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,680
also do not recommend the use of our

355
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,230
own smtp planes although we configure them

356
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,600
properly since it is very  Simple that they

357
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,030
can detect this server as

358
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,520
malicious instead I recommend the

359
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,290
use of specialized services for

360
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,460
sending smtp

361
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:02,820
such as send in blue or even

362
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,120
the sima mail mandrel these two

363
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,460
tools are usually quite useful

364
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,200
and re functionalities that allow us

365
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,150
generate private IP addresses

366
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,860
only for us, avoiding as

367
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,900
much as possible our emails reach our

368
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,120
destination and increasing the

369
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,649
success rates of our targeted attacks

370
00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:24,290
after this I highly recommend

371
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:27,110
doing tests and tests and remember to

372
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,970
do tests before mounting any

373
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,009
electronic cutoff because normally a

374
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:33,829
one shot type scenario or we do it

375
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:36,559
at the  at first or we reduce

376
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:39,259
our success rate a lot if everything works

377
00:14:39,259 --> 00:14:40,869
properly

378
00:14:40,869 --> 00:14:43,279
we have an axel within the

379
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,499
organization and remember how

380
00:14:45,499 --> 00:14:47,839
our friend Carlos Pérez would say this is just

381
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,910
the beginning with the external infrastructure it

382
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,619
is very similar

383
00:14:51,619 --> 00:14:53,329
we do a numbering recognition phase we

384
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:55,369
identify programs of

385
00:14:55,369 --> 00:14:56,420
Security with the different

386
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,860
security tools that we have

387
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,600
at hand, finally, the

388
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,160
security programs are used, the

389
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,959
employers that we previously identified are used,

390
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,579
we try to have brute force and the

391
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:06,769
purpose is to gain access to the

392
00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:09,139
organization by executing code that

393
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:11,420
allows us to use any of the  Agents

394
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,009
who have previously identified the

395
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:15,679
matrices 2 and finally we have the hd in

396
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:17,779
the system remember that the h is not the

397
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:19,910
end this in the beginning and also

398
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,290
remember that when we are doing

399
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,850
audits for example election

400
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,730
while it is the size does matter and we

401
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,649
owe goals to quiroga  help us

402
00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:29,269
that is with the end  d that the units

403
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:31,329
are always stronger than the original

404
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:33,709
ready, we will ask the entire organization for a

405
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:35,149
chela.Now we are going

406
00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:37,279
to use this access to review

407
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,839
as much information about the

408
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:40,819
objective we achieve, taking into

409
00:15:40,819 --> 00:15:42,410
account that our purpose is to meet

410
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,779
the proposed goal  In many cases we

411
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:46,579
can have very specific objectives

412
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:47,959
such as creating an account in the

413
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:50,119
state in a specific system or

414
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:51,800
transferring money from one bank account

415
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,920
to another bank account or simply

416
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,110
obtaining as many equipment as

417
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,759
possible within the organization but

418
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:01,749
without being detected

419
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,279
remembering  Whenever the access from the

420
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:06,860
beginning we are going to use the concept

421
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,010
of the disk, it was basically avoid

422
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,170
touching as much as possible any information

423
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,089
stored on the hard disk many of

424
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:15,920
the protection solutions are based on

425
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,900
the files if we try to

426
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,580
manage all our movements in the

427
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,589
memory of  the computers that we infect we are

428
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:23,300
going to avoid  to the maximum

429
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,730
detection, always try to camouflage those

430
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,650
within the system, for this

431
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:30,860
the gtf or vince bacilli will help us a lot,

432
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,770
which are basically binaries of the system

433
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:36,500
that serve us for other purposes than

434
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,270
the signed services of the operating system,

435
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,130
many times we avoid detections

436
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,470
because it can  be capturing

437
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:46,370
the screen at all times the keyboard is

438
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,750
capturing traffic because a

439
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,660
malicious person who wants to compromise

440
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,010
the organization first to try

441
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,529
finds out as much as possible about it he will

442
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:56,390
try to see how to use the

443
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,740
tools that are installed on the

444
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,380
system he will look at the

445
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,180
internal applications  How they are used will you want to

446
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,579
have credentials in them and many

447
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,170
times there is the purpose or objective

448
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,540
of the project only when we have already

449
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,490
made it there, yes we can make

450
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,810
lateral movements with the

451
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,400
tools that we all know for

452
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,589
this purpose and the cycle is repeated with

453
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:17,599
each new  access let's do the same

454
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,280
try m  keep in memory to

455
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,530
use life from the system will

456
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,910
identify the maximum of the system that

457
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,859
we have just captured to meet

458
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:26,810
our objectives quickly take into

459
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,250
account the collection of information and

460
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,050
numbering that we did on the

461
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,060
digital assets and on the collaborators of

462
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,950
the organization that information

463
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,780
will also be used  in the

464
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,670
security audit that includes within its

465
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,990
scope of physical security components

466
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,480


467
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,549
the recognition for an audit that

468
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:46,040
includes the physical security variety

469
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,660
depending on whether our client has

470
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,450
direct customer service or if they are not

471
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:53,270
used to having people outside

472
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,340
their organization hanging around  the

473
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,350
facilities in any of the other

474
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,669
cases it is necessary to carry out a

475
00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:00,290
survey on the facilities

476
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,570
that we are going to audit if it is possible to take

477
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:05,330
a tour of them look at the

478
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,059
scene

479
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:08,889
in many cases we usually

480
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:11,080
rent vehicles for theirs you

481
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,360
can easily identify patterns

482
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,600
of c  uniform behavior

483
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,220
identification cards and any element

484
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,980
that may be useful to camouflage them as

485
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,960
part of the organization and raise the

486
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,120
least possible noise sometimes from the

487
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,740
second vehicle it is tried to return

488
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,779
audits to wireless security

489
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:30,730
always taking into account lifting in

490
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,799
the special threat  possible, therefore we

491
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,629
recommend cars with tinted

492
00:18:34,629 --> 00:18:36,490
windows so that the interior is not seen

493
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,870
what is being done

494
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:40,149
normally, computers are usually handled

495
00:18:40,149 --> 00:18:42,730
inside antennas and

496
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,919
different hardware elements that

497
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:46,869
can be very striking for

498
00:18:46,869 --> 00:18:49,090
security personnel in unfavorable scenarios.

499
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,919
With

500
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:53,230
security elements, normally the first

501
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,970
obstacle you have is a

502
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:57,249
receptionist, usually wetting in the

503
00:18:57,249 --> 00:18:59,289
vast majority, although if I were a man

504
00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:00,340
there would be no problem,

505
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,889
simply change the pretext of the

506
00:19:02,889 --> 00:19:04,899
attack that we usually do because this

507
00:19:04,899 --> 00:19:07,570
attack aims at feelings and

508
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,879
consists mainly of  Send  a bouquet

509
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:11,340
of roses

510
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,740
the card in the case if it were a man we

511
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,840
would send a package of surprises

512
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,820
with some chocolates without any

513
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,950
card and a piece of paper that says that the

514
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,920
card is inside a memory

515
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,320
of seve obviously state I do not see of seve

516
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,930
has been carefully prepared and

517
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,930
tested so that when entering the memory

518
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:33,120
and executing the climate document that

519
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,490
brings the letter that effectively brings a

520
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:37,380
message of love supposedly from an

521
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,170
admirer or an anonymous admirer this

522
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,330
person infects the machine and we

523
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:43,860
can have a team within

524
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,960
the organization in the  cases in which

525
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,820
we have carried out this process and here not

526
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,590
only the

527
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:52,350
receptionist's or receptionist's equipment is infected

528
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,150
but other equipment is also usually detected

529
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,220
since it is not very normal to

530
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,950
receive a bouquet of roses a gift that

531
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,720
on unusual dates

532
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,460
this  It generates noise within your friends and

533
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,680
close people who will want to

534
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,110
see the card out of curiosity, therefore

535
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,970
we have ot  There are infected computers in the

536
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,130
organization, if there is no time

537
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,750
with little surveillance, we can make

538
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,190
tours of the

539
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,080
organization's installation, carrying out attacks that go

540
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,760
completely unnoticed, as

541
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,480
we are going to see below,

542
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,030
there are cycle businesses,

543
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,050
some of them are more important in the

544
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:34,920
country  Like the white pineapple it

545
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,850
is a typical roll in the facilities

546
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,690
basically the day to record and if it is

547
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,640
showing on the screen it shows in the

548
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,830
red point where I am at

549
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,210
each moment

550
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,130
in the bag I carry a wifi pineapple

551
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,990
configured to perform the

552
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:52,060
twin attack  evil is basically

553
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,620
listening to the requests that are in the

554
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,960
air of the different wifi devices

555
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,630
looking for known networks it

556
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,460
impersonates these known networks so that the

557
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,410
devices automatically connect

558
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,810
to it and once they connect to it because it

559
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,820
has a 3g modem that works for them  to give

560
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,220
internet and I get in the middle of the

561
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,780
communication to capture all the

562
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,490
traffic  This is something quite

563
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,680
interesting, the purpose of this

564
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,480
research was to take a series of

565
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,560
statistics,

566
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,480
the statistics were released and

567
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,960
can be found in the talk to

568
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,940
be held in 2012 that has

569
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,460
aged quite well and you will

570
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,590
find several of the videos

571
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,789
Iniesta chat

572
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,179
if in the recognition process we

573
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:39,399
identify the physical security is

574
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:42,279
really bad or non-existent, it is much

575
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:44,529
simpler for us to carry out a

576
00:21:44,529 --> 00:21:46,720
process of removing a computer equipment

577
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,539
such as a laptop,

578
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:51,340
bypassing the password or a

579
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,899
dumper or a  the same a change of the

580
00:21:52,899 --> 00:21:55,360
same make a cloned of the hard disk

581
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,309
for later analysis install on

582
00:21:57,309 --> 00:21:59,620
the equipment an agent that we have already

583
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,559
identified before and return the equipment

584
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,929
obviously this taking into account because

585
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:06,250
the current security controls

586
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,320
trying not to raise more suspicion

587
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,059
works very  either on Friday

588
00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:12,490
afternoon trying to return it the same

589
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,679
Friday afternoon or Monday first  Now

590
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:16,510
so that no alarm is raised,

591
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,730
the truth is that I am really with the

592
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,080
ease that this can be done

593
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,669
even in entities that have

594
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:23,110
contracted private security and

595
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,510
clearly it is much simpler than

596
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,010
carrying out a frontal attack

597
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:30,360
on the organization's infrastructure,

598
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,340
but what if  They review the briefcases

599
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,110
because that is why recognition is

600
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,390
started, the same if we wanted to do the

601
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,700
same test that we did before where

602
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,590
we entered with an element that is being

603
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,850
attacks on all

604
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,010
wireless devices such as the mind such as

605
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,410
the wifi pineapple because there are other ways to

606
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:48,600
capture these  devices so that it

607
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,340
goes unnoticed even if they

608
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,120
check the bag here an example of it

609
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,150
here in the first case in which

610
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:00,240
a book is used as a front that

611
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,800
can easily go in a suitcase

612
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,620
this book is specially designed

613
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:09,270
glued all its sheets and

614
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,640
we have  generated a specific space

615
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,860
within him apparently does not generate suspicions

616
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,480
for his interior  r

617
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,400
the penya wifi is found as such with

618
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,080
all the elements necessary for its

619
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,000
operation until the battery at the

620
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,100
time of ge and work properly

621
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,350
without any problem since the paper did not

622
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,060
generate any conflict with the wifi signal

623
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,120


624
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,919
now suppose that we could not

625
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,100
physically access the element either  Remember

626
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,990
that this is the year 2012 in the drones

627
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,460
they were not very popular yet,

628
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:42,000
fortunately we got a friend who

629
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,580
handled the whole model airplane issue,

630
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,429
we managed to put the wifi pineapple inside

631
00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:49,440
this element and we achieved very good

632
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,690
results because in the air with

633
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:54,720
more obstacles, we managed to get there  to a

634
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,940
good number of devices that

635
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,710
can easily be put on the

636
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,169
roof of the organization without attracting

637
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:03,840
much attention but we have just seen

638
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,360
a case in which security is low or

639
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,730
null, now we are going to see different

640
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,440
situations in which security

641
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,289
increases a  little and how we can

642
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:16,550
face certain controls for example

643
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:19,040
what happens if there is something d  e surveillance if

644
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,020
there are control systems like these, for

645
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,000
example, they are very common in government entities

646
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,100
where they do not allow

647
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,550
technological devices to enter or where there is a

648
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,770
metal detector to provide the

649
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,549
entry of weapons etc.

650
00:24:33,549 --> 00:24:35,679


651
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,570
They allow

652
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:39,970
liquids to pass through them, although there are certain

653
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:41,559
elements that, due to the malice of the

654
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:44,379
security guards themselves, make them pass

655
00:24:44,379 --> 00:24:46,509
through several, for example,

656
00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:49,269
plastic bottles, they know that if they

657
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:51,129
are well sealed they will not affect the

658
00:24:51,129 --> 00:24:52,749
machine and that they sell different

659
00:24:52,749 --> 00:24:54,489
elements.  so that one can enter

660
00:24:54,489 --> 00:24:56,590
objects inside it that is already well

661
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,360
known in prisons it is often

662
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,429
used a lot in different situations

663
00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:02,499
they are also often used they are

664
00:25:02,499 --> 00:25:04,090
easily bought by moving forward

665
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:06,519
but we have identified that in

666
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:08,980
situations like these, nothing better

667
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,789
than the old and  reliable coffee

668
00:25:11,789 --> 00:25:13,649
because coffee because coffee

669
00:25:13,649 --> 00:25:15,899
is normally an element that  We are

670
00:25:15,899 --> 00:25:18,359
very struck by the fact that apart from this it is

671
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:20,249
easy for it to be irrigated and affect the

672
00:25:20,249 --> 00:25:22,470
machinery as such and it is an element

673
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,239
with which several tests can be carried out and

674
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:25,889
look at the reaction of the safety area,

675
00:25:25,889 --> 00:25:28,440
so if you like all the

676
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,090
instructional topics  physics and

677
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:32,279
the art attack program called their attention,

678
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,109
because being in the right place

679
00:25:34,109 --> 00:25:36,690
because in this type of scenario because

680
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:38,129
we have to do many crafts as

681
00:25:38,129 --> 00:25:39,559
we see here

682
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:41,570
we put the elements that we want to

683
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,309
enter in a transparent plastic bag

684
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:47,200
we put it inside the coffee

685
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,730
here you can  To see how elements

686
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:52,159
of super g totally here we intentionally leave a

687
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,840
tip so that

688
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,149
you can observe then we cover it

689
00:25:56,149 --> 00:25:58,279
and there is no problem if

690
00:25:58,279 --> 00:25:59,960
we need more space we could

691
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,279
use the box where the coffee comes

692
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,289
but that is usually more risky, the

693
00:26:03,289 --> 00:26:04,730
same with the coffee on top you do not know

694
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,740
suspicious but it is much more reliable

695
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,049
within the coffee

696
00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:11,749
any resource is useful many times it

697
00:26:11,749 --> 00:26:13,460
does not need  We do not even enter

698
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,739
hardware elements with the same

699
00:26:15,739 --> 00:26:17,450
elements that are available

700
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,369
for users to have a self-service,

701
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,619
we can carry out our work, which is

702
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:24,169
the case of the kiosk that we found

703
00:26:24,169 --> 00:26:25,820
within an organization that we are

704
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,100
auditing, this kiosk was not

705
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,440
properly organized and in  This case

706
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,690
served us as a bastion team so that

707
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:34,549
from there we could carry out many of

708
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:36,019
the audit processes that we were

709
00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:38,480
carrying out.Sometimes the controls are not

710
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,369
so simple.

711
00:26:40,369 --> 00:26:42,320


712
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,269


713
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,710
We have had to test

714
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,749
biometric authorization systems,

715
00:26:47,749 --> 00:26:50,330
be it

716
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:53,269
facial identification or fingerprint identification, the process is

717
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:55,519
really not easy but you can

718
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:57,590
reach good results with few

719
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,359
resources as long as we let the imagination last.

720
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:00,409


721
00:27:00,409 --> 00:27:02,149
Normally these are not the

722
00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:03,649
typical controls that are used.  They will find you in an

723
00:27:03,649 --> 00:27:05,690
organization.  Typical roles

724
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:08,720
are usually these types of elements,

725
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,629
basically authentication systems

726
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,129
based on identification cards,

727
00:27:13,129 --> 00:27:15,800
here the

728
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,350
typical techniques of social engineering such as tail

729
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,870
gate are used a lot and basically simulate that you are

730
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:23,000
busy and with your arms occupied so

731
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,520
that an employee with authentication gives us

732
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,620
access  That is what happened in this

733
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,750
scenario, for example, human nature

734
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,630
is to help and in that case when

735
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,430
seeing a person busy with the phone

736
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:37,070
in hand and with coffee in hand,

737
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:40,010


738
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:41,660
these systems allow access to the organization many times.

739
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,120
Authentication open the

740
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,310
doors of the kingdom and we can

741
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,350
find them in different scenarios here,

742
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,120
for example in an elevator is the

743
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,130
ideal setting to

744
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:54,260
clone this type of cards because they are

745
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,880
very closed spaces in which one

746
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,560
can have cruelty now  easy to

747
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,570
get close to people's pockets

748
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,720
and generate no suspicion

749
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,700
and in this case we managed to create  A

750
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,820
simulate card with the same Aguirre

751
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,760
EFE and have access to all the floors of

752
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,669
the organization

753
00:28:12,669 --> 00:28:14,830
if you find this person on the

754
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:17,409
stage you are watching and then you

755
00:28:17,409 --> 00:28:19,480
find this person who

756
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,759
generates more confidence obviously the

757
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:24,970
person who is informed as a

758
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,739
pilot  of plane true because the

759
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:29,409
context in which it is found gives it

760
00:28:29,409 --> 00:28:32,049
more authority the same happens in a

761
00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:34,330
physical training process there is a

762
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:35,889
very famous saying that says that the habit

763
00:28:35,889 --> 00:28:38,100
does not go towards the eye in cases of

764
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,749
physical security audits it is the

765
00:28:40,749 --> 00:28:43,179
opposite  the habit towards the monk

766
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,919
if in the previous recognition phase

767
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:46,629
you manage to identify the uniforms and

768
00:28:46,629 --> 00:28:48,159
send them to be garments

769
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,889
similar to them, you have already done 50

770
00:28:50,889 --> 00:28:52,539
percent of the work because although

771
00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:54,609
the organization has never seen the fact that you have already seen

772
00:28:54,609 --> 00:28:56,109
these garments

773
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,940
they are giving themselves authority in that environment

774
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,889
many times they do not even need the

775
00:28:59,889 --> 00:29:00,850


776
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,919
masako uniform that they use the same clothes that

777
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:05,590
are useful  Hoisting people within

778
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,840
the organization's environment so that it goes

779
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,059
unnoticed in this case, for example,

780
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:12,309
we can identify that

781
00:29:12,309 --> 00:29:14,649
different protective garments are used, in

782
00:29:14,649 --> 00:29:17,860
particular protective boots and helmets,

783
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,690
and we manage to enter the organization

784
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:22,780
without attracting attention whenever we

785
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,429
do this type of  tests it is

786
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,290
necessary that you are recording at all

787
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:28,030
times because we need

788
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:31,210
visual evidence of what is happening that is

789
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:33,220
recommended that you always

790
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,860
test the recording before entering the

791
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,290
realization so that you are clear

792
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:39,700
about the angle of view you are

793
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,250
having and what not  it happens that

794
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:45,160
suddenly some morphological issue may end up

795
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:49,380
recording at an unwanted angle

796
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,420
always review the videos it is

797
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,670
important not only to record but

798
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:56,970
also to take into account watching the videos

799
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:00,060
because many times the video captures more

800
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,700
than the human eye here can flow is

801
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,400
censored  but we were able to identify

802
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,830
sensitive information on a glass that

803
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:10,170
had been  Written on which it was

804
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:12,300
very useful for that audit, the

805
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,570
same here were some sheets,

806
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:16,710
organize them on a desk, we

807
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:19,650
recommend these types of cameras, one

808
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:21,840
is the button type that you put on your

809
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,240
shirt and start recording another is the

810
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,090
typical one of the  Fortunately, the

811
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:28,740
expression is stable, they are not very high

812
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,080
and the recording quality has improved a

813
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,299
lot in recent times

814
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:35,190
here for example we can see the power

815
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:38,429
of the uniform since the very

816
00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:41,039
collaborative girl is helping us to do

817
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,860
this connectivity test between him and

818
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,720
we are installing  hardware cables

819
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,700
to be able to receive you, which is

820
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,119
in terms of the operating system and

821
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:53,039
three other applications that you have in your

822
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,419
station,

823
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:57,149
this finding was very interesting because

824
00:30:57,149 --> 00:30:59,369
when we presented it to the board of

825
00:30:59,369 --> 00:31:00,960
directors,

826
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,840
the fact that we obtained access to

827
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,640
the critical systems of the  region and they did

828
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,070
not care as much as milk that the

829
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:11,279
girl had so much cash exposed to the

830
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,649
naked eye this  it can show

831
00:31:13,649 --> 00:31:16,169
a bit the disconnection that exists between the

832
00:31:16,169 --> 00:31:18,029
managers of an organization with the

833
00:31:18,029 --> 00:31:19,260
consequences that a computer attack may have,

834
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,639


835
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:23,619
whoever this never ends

836
00:31:23,619 --> 00:31:25,269
please installed basically is a

837
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:27,309
device largely undetectable

838
00:31:27,309 --> 00:31:29,499
by the operating system that  captures the

839
00:31:29,499 --> 00:31:31,359
positions of the keyboards the triples in an

840
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:33,070
internal memory and then cannot see

841
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:35,079
that it was edited in the keyboards that were

842
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:37,480
connected to hero

843
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,919
our last adventure due to a

844
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:40,690
misadventure component to be able to give a

845
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,309
title to this talk comes when

846
00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:44,049
we are doing the bridging process and

847
00:31:44,049 --> 00:31:45,730
With a wide scope that included the

848
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,980
physical security tests, we were

849
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,840
planning with the client the days in

850
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,940
which to reach them in this process and,

851
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,250
coincidentally, he tells us that he was very

852
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,870
disappointed with the process that

853
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,280
another driver house reached him last year

854
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,500
because he had limited himself to

855
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,960
leave an abandoned house from which

856
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,760
you have a hundred automated networks

857
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,710
i  wireless networks and that his

858
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:07,570
security personnel quickly identified

859
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:09,160
us, we told him that this is the

860
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,309
hello world of this type of tests,

861
00:32:12,309 --> 00:32:14,200
calm that with us he was not going to

862
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,960
have that kind of thing, we had next to

863
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,090
the stage, we had already photographed

864
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,380
the credentials with which they were

865
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,840
Identify the authorized personnel

866
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,059
we had made

867
00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:27,549
copies of those credentials on our bill on the

868
00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:29,140
right side you can see that it is ours

869
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,140
in fact the border is white because we

870
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,000
got the white cards and

871
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,700
we had to paint a little with black marker,

872
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,090
do some crafts and yes

873
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,500
You are a bit detailed, you will

874
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,880
realize that we did not have the tape to be

875
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,660
able to get

876
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,060
this credential on our necks because

877
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,340
nothing that a shoelace could not

878
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,680
solve and that is how we managed to have

879
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,720
our credentials of

880
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,540
authorized personnel we delivered a critical

881
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,390
letter to leave the  home and in the

882
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:00,820
event that we are detected fortunately

883
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,950
we did not have to use this car  But

884
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,810
it is always good to have it, what we did

885
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,760
in this case was to copy it at

886
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,010
three times a second from the team members, they

887
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,840
will need it, it

888
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,760
will not only remain in their hands until here,

889
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,980
everything is fine.

890
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,350


891
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:19,870
This is why we came up with the

892
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:23,160
idea of carrying

893
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,290
chocolates and some sheets of paper in gift bags with

894
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:28,720
instructions so that the processes

895
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,340
carried out in their workstations

896
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,650
and with these instructions we managed to

897
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:34,450
compromise the machines so

898
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:36,970
we touched a single key, the

899
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:38,590
strategy was already in place.  Defined

900
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,690
we see one of the busiest headquarters

901
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,460
of the organization and we entered through the

902
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,799
main door it stopped from the

903
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,190
plants we went to the top floor

904
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:49,480
every time they put an obstacle we

905
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,370
simply showed our beautiful

906
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:53,890
credential with shoelaces and

907
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,960
we reached the top floor  from

908
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,970
there down we began to distribute the

909
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:00,100
chocolates with the inst  ructions until we

910
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,860
reach the first floor we deliver to the

911
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:05,500
people in the box this is a

912
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,168
financial institution also their respective

913
00:34:08,168 --> 00:34:10,239
chocolate with the instructions and

914
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,119
before leaving we give a chocolate to the

915
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,589
security person who was at the

916
00:34:14,589 --> 00:34:16,020
door

917
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,790
the satisfaction of a job well done

918
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:20,668
us  We went to look at the loot that we had

919
00:34:20,668 --> 00:34:23,130
actually obtained, several people

920
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,719
had carried out the process that was

921
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,520
syndicated to them on the sheets of paper,

922
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,739
this had given us several accesses of the

923
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:30,570
organization, some with good

924
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,580
privileges that opened the doors

925
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,918
of the kingdom for us, we practically decided to

926
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:36,540
carry out certain tasks there  and then

927
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,418
go to eat something while we were already

928
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:41,880
eating this it took a long time

929
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,668
since we did the process until

930
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:46,469
we received this call basically

931
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:47,639
the calls told us that they

932
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:51,330
detected us in the

933
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:53,850
organization's WhatsApp group someone had asked

934
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:54,960
what this test was about

935
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,690
connectivity and had put a photo of

936
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,720
the inst  Ituciones that we had sent

937
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,150
this looking at the logs of the

938
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,100
conductions that we had received because it

939
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,640
expanded a little more

940
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,040
the results that we have obtained because

941
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,830
after they published that photo in

942
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:14,480
this group of WhatsApp because more people

943
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,730
out of curiosity carried out the same steps

944
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:19,030
for the  What was

945
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:21,100
happening is that within this

946
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:24,280
WhatsApp group the Venezuelans and Guatemalans called us villages

947
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,600


948
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,550
and there is an internal that we will keep

949
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:32,550
I think for a long time

950
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:35,220
the fact is that the process was effective,

951
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:38,490
the response was very late from

952
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:40,710
the team  both

953
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:44,280
physical security and computer security we

954
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,290
already had access to all the equipment and

955
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,850
we had already compromised how the

956
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,470
organization is, this is part of the

957
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,090
adventure but if you know in the

958
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:52,830
title it says misfortune well and what happened

959
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,480
in the programming that we had for the

960
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,330
project  We had defined certain

961
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:59,100
dates for this, we had already

962
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,020
finished this work a few days later.

963
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,090
Someone writes on Instagram and says

964
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:06,990
hello Jaime, I am from X countries, it turns out that

965
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,280
I am in a group of

966
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,260
financial entities and I have been sent in this

967
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,540
surprised I think it says alleged

968
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,090
impersonators of officials these

969
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,520
suspects were captured in the

970
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,040
city of the city where we

971
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,860
are in  We were

972
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,390
captured in this way at what moments we were

973
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:28,360
captured obviously what we did

974
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,180
first of all was to raise a

975
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,430
request to identify

976
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:37,120
what had happened and we realized that

977
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,830
to the private security company that

978
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,600
outsourced the banking institution that

979
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,180
hired our services  He came

980
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,520
up with the great idea of showing as a

981
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,490
result of his good work the alleged

982
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:51,190
capture of three suspects whom

983
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:54,400
we will affectionately call the Venezuelans

984
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,930
and the Guatemalan

985
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:59,880
demonstrating the effectiveness of their

986
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,500
work protected from the safety of

987
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,680
their clients, something that is totally

988
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,430
false but that  for us it is

989
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,530
still an anecdote plus

990
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:13,380
the agre  Ga to the title of misadventures to

991
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,660
all this path adventures that one does not

992
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:19,369
usually go when one is passionate about something

993
00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:22,400
and in my case that something is computer security

994
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,769
in fact when we

995
00:37:24,769 --> 00:37:26,109
found out about this incident

996
00:37:26,109 --> 00:37:28,849
we immediately knew that at some

997
00:37:28,849 --> 00:37:31,460
point I study to finish in one of

998
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:35,319
our  talks and that moment is now,

999

valuable content and if I do not have space for

1003

questions I invite you to continue the

1004

always a character who lives the

1011
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,130
whole experience and this photograph is

1012
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:08,800
doing things so that it is understood

1013
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,580
that it is to experience the experience of course if

1014
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,920
not done is something in  what we have seen

1015
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,080
that not many people comment clearly because

1016
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,030
there are confidentiality agreements  ad that is

1017
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,980
signed so that more information is not exposed,

1018
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:24,360
but in this case, because one

1019
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,620
requested permission to make a team and

1020
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,120
that obviously censors everything that is

1021
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:31,730
objectionable and I

1022
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:37,359
obviously want those monkeys there who are,

1023
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:42,470
we did not want to expose their faces, it seems

1024
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:45,530
wonderful that I  I have questions

1025
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:46,910
from the public that has been

1026
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:49,910
sharing with us in this

1027
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,400
wonderful day about five

1028
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,069
seconds we are connecting they pay us

1029
00:38:56,069 --> 00:39:02,640
to the beloved chat of the 8.8

1030
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,229
solidarity transmission that is already reaching its

1031
00:39:04,229 --> 00:39:05,940
closure

1032
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:08,190
and here we have several questions valeria

1033
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,900
pérez asks how to handle  the

1034
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,550
nerves when doing these tests and what

1035
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:15,040
type of training is done

1036
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,820
well because the nerves are always there

1037
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:22,000
obviously one has a little more

1038
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,890
experience with these issues and it is already

1039
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:26,560
taking a bit as we say here but well

1040
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,300
it is always how to handle the

1041
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,980
situation remember that you were

1042
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:33,070
hired for this is not that you

1043
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,990
are there trying to do  something bad and

1044
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:37,990
retired because if there is always a

1045
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:40,450
lifesaving letter that I request

1046
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:43,810
in case you can go through a

1047
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:46,690
situation then maluca or this happens

1048
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:49,690
older we have never had to use it

1049
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:51,970
but but always as

1050
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:55,510
one of that supported it to have those guarantees but not

1051
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:57,610
basically  If you get nervous in

1052
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:59,070
this type of situation, it is going to be

1053
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:02,890
a failed test, that is what happens,

1054
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:05,200
you cannot get nervous and it was necessary in

1055
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,900
that type of situation.

1056
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,369


1057
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:11,779


1058
00:40:11,779 --> 00:40:13,819


1059
00:40:13,819 --> 00:40:16,140
office documents sent by good mail,

1060
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,810
a typical recommendation is that in

1061
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:21,320
the firewall configuration,

1062
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,880
office applications are prevented from

1063
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,780
accessing the internet,

1064
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,030
this is independent

1065
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,890
of the fact that training has been given

1066
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:30,450
to the staff to enable

1067
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:32,220
macros and all this that always  They fail

1068
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:35,600
because every time people have

1069
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,440
different ways of,

1070
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,470
let's say, focus on the user who does

1071
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:44,690
what to do

1072
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:47,990
if the application as such has

1073
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:50,980
the internet exit inside it because it is much more

1074
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:53,660
difficult for an attacker to stop

1075
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,760
this access because normally the

1076
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,250
attacker teasing inside the pdf

1077
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:01,579
or the word file but generates

1078
00:41:01,579 --> 00:41:02,799


1079
00:41:02,799 --> 00:41:05,229
a small code that  always download the

1080
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:07,119
malicious payload from the other side to

1081
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,369
prevent the pp or the climate file from

1082
00:41:09,369 --> 00:41:12,489
being affected as much as possible so if

1083
00:41:12,489 --> 00:41:14,990
one starts going to the internet then it

1084
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:17,030
will have a little more security when it

1085
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:18,380
comes to protecting users against

1086
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,869
this type  of attacks

1087
00:41:20,869 --> 00:41:24,890
iron asks how much budget they allocate

1088
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:27,140
to acquire the elements they use in

1089
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,010
these tests well

1090
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:33,560
to see if you saw in the talk

1091
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,450
this is with a very low budget you

1092
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:37,220
saw that we even used

1093
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:40,400
shoelaces to generate the

1094
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,960
rosettes gift bags for this

1095
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,380
situation then  de was an entity in a

1096
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,570
bank and it was in

1097
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:53,240
December so we took advantage

1098
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,220
of the Christmas excuse and all this

1099
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:58,330
leads  We gave gift bags of chocolates and

1100
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:00,440
simply a sheet of paper printed

1101
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,670
with the logos of the company so that they could

1102
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:03,440
do certain steps.

1103
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,140


1104
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,150


1105
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,620


1106
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,540
I followed the

1107
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,070
instructions and they ate a chocolate

1108
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:15,200
so it is not really necessary to

1109
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,510
have large hardware elements

1110
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:18,650
to do this, rather to have

1111
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:19,600
creativity

1112
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,130
obviously there are devices that one

1113
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:23,870
should always have, for example, the kilos

1114
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:26,090
for different hardware elements to

1115
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:27,830
do wireless tests but

1116
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:30,410
normally they are things that  One does not buy

1117
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:31,970
specifically for a test but

1118
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:35,180
the birth of the entire work kit

1119
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:38,150
so well only once in an

1120
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:40,309
audit in Panama we had to leave

1121
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:43,640
our elements as leaving them

1122
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,380
abandoned it was a

1123
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:47,390
hardware keylogger that allowed

1124
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:50,119
Wi-Fi connectivity but they are very cases  sporadic

1125
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:51,980
and those items do not exceed $ 100

1126
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,329
in  So it is totally acceptable

1127
00:42:53,329 --> 00:42:56,559
because for a project

1128
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:59,050
things are closed, question has

1129
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:01,630
someone ever

1130
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:03,369
caught them, how did they deal with that, they were

1131
00:43:03,369 --> 00:43:05,339
denounced

1132
00:43:05,339 --> 00:43:07,799
is not the closest thing that they caught us, it

1133
00:43:07,799 --> 00:43:09,479
is that supposedly they

1134
00:43:09,479 --> 00:43:12,560
captured us, as shown there,

1135
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:17,290
but we were not  They have discovered that

1136
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:20,200
they are always practical, in fact, with

1137
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,510
most of the colleagues, as it is

1138
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:24,280
an account that the number of are very

1139
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,750
poorly prepared for this type of

1140
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,300


1141
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,370
tests, suddenly they focus a lot the technological elements are

1142
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:32,130
not prepared

1143
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:34,200
enough for physical tests

1144
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,180
Focused or very directed to the

1145
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,580
organization and the truth is,

1146
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:41,070
fortunately, we have had a

1147
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:42,510
chip result, certainly in

1148
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:45,120
this type of tests, but I have

1149
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,650
heard, you can have people who

1150
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:48,990
detect them and simply with the letter that

1151
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:51,120
you always ask for, you fix the

1152
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,740
situations are called to the right people

1153
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:55,160
and because we lack older

1154
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,029
yes yes

1155
00:43:58,029 --> 00:44:02,059
he says that re  Today's recommendation is clearly seen

1156
00:44:02,059 --> 00:44:04,670
on the screen what recommendation of

1157
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:07,220
basic access controls can be done

1158
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,660
to protect against

1159
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,730
physical instruction attacks a good procedure

1160
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:12,460
known to the entire organization

1161
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:14,809
investing in access control devices

1162
00:44:14,809 --> 00:44:17,410
camera scanner what would be your

1163
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:20,569
direct recommendation well the majority

1164
00:44:20,569 --> 00:44:23,270
of the companies that have the need to carry

1165
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:24,770
out this type of program that already

1166
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:26,599
have access control systems,

1167
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:28,579
that is, they already have

1168
00:44:28,579 --> 00:44:30,349
private surveillance, they already have, say

1169
00:44:30,349 --> 00:44:32,750
, identification cards to

1170
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:35,250
access certain,

1171
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:38,100
say, private areas or that require

1172
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:40,380
additional security  such as a datacenter or

1173
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:43,680
certain offices but what we have seen

1174
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,990
in general is that the devices

1175
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:48,990
that are purchased are not previously audited,

1176
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:51,060
that is to say, it is

1177
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:53,490
always the cheapest and the cheapest usually

1178
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:55,650
has technology that is already well known

1179
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:57,460
and is very easy

1180
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:01,560
to break like mine

1181
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:04,150
so

1182
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:06,880
then what I would recommend is to make

1183
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,950
a  investment in

1184
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:12,290
security systems but already tested

1185
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:14,240
to make us cheaper but to

1186
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,450
do due diligence of good

1187
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:20,420
technology and above all a lot of training

1188
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,800
for our own staff if you see they do not

1189
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:26,660
serve a secure access system if

1190
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:28,160
someone already opens  the door to one because

1191
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,690
he is busy drinking his coffee and

1192
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:32,560
talking on the phone

1193
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,860
[Music]

1194
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:41,610
is there,

1195
00:45:41,829 --> 00:45:44,339
yes, it

1196
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:46,910
is the pear,

1197
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,250
but what are you listening to?

1198
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:53,780


1199
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:56,849


1200
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,220


1201
00:46:11,569 --> 00:46:15,160
here he

1202
00:46:15,289 --> 00:46:17,999
asks what life in jail is like

1203
00:46:17,999 --> 00:46:20,419
for a hack

1204
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:23,810
after the truth we were saturated

1205
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:26,360
as I said in the circular it

1206
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:30,980
was simply when they gave us

1207
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:33,470
that circular to show

1208
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:35,390
results but in fact

1209
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:36,680
we were captured and not studying

1210
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,630
any problem and  Well obviously only

1211
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:41,720
if the company was not left because in the

1212
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,480
private security part they had to

1213
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:48,790
subcontract then we are fine

1214
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:55,220
we are super  r well

1215
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:57,109
jaime there are more questions what is the

1216
00:46:57,109 --> 00:47:00,239
name of the hardware of the pineapple

1217
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:04,349
is called literal wifi ping pong or

1218
00:47:04,349 --> 00:47:08,279
pineapple wifi in English sells it that

1219
00:47:08,279 --> 00:47:11,459
people leave faith and find it very

1220
00:47:11,459 --> 00:47:15,540
easily in your store there

1221
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,760
with a cross you need them for the  next

1222
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,660
mission impossible movie

1223
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,190
the most realistic way and many times in

1224
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:26,000
this

1225
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,520
area reality surpasses much of fiction

1226
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,130
and the truth is that if the subject of coffee

1227
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:33,390
for example occurred to us in an

1228
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:35,100
audit in which they had that type

1229
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:37,200
of security controls  It was a

1230
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,290
government institution and we saw how

1231
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:42,450
someone threw me into the cafe

1232
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:44,850
putting it there, we came up with that and

1233
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:46,770
we are going to use it and it works very

1234
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:50,040
well people do not think that a cup

1235
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:55,100
of coffee is entering more things

1236
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:59,330
Jaime I have to fire you  Thank you

1237
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:02,850

00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:04,440
chat, the knowledge, your experience

00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,450
as always in all the times you have

1240

grateful soon to be able to embrace how

1243
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:14,640
it looks and celebrate with some companies a

1244
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,160
physical version of 8.8 which is the one

1245
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,319
we have been waiting for a long time

1246
00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:22,149
I am also waiting for that and the

1247
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:24,099
basket is needed as a

1248
00:48:24,099 --> 00:48:26,109
face-to-face conference and

1249

cure a hc de chile foundation and who pays us the

1257
00:48:51,819 --> 00:48:53,859
formal closing of how  There has been this

1258
00:48:53,859 --> 00:48:56,109
solidarity event that has been

1259
00:48:56,109 --> 00:48:58,859
six preponderant talks from 10 in the morning onwards

1260
00:48:58,859 --> 00:49:00,939
and the contribution of each of

1261
00:49:00,939 --> 00:49:02,079
you who are connected plus the

1262
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:04,390
companies that have been participating with

1263
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:05,619
us, acquiring tickets to

1264
00:49:05,619 --> 00:49:08,439
give to the people of your company,

1265
00:49:08,439 --> 00:49:10,899
even contributing to  times and perhaps strong

1266
00:49:10,899 --> 00:49:12,159
in time access only for the

1267
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:14,580
fact that says how are you

1268
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:17,770
[Music]

1269
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:23,650
who  ro to thank all the

1270
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:24,910
exhibitors

1271
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:31,859
your transmission sounds very slow but

1272
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,280
so close more or less armed with how it

1273
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,250
was we have

1274
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:40,470
good I find that it is super

1275
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:42,390
interesting and I was connected all

1276
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:44,460
day listening to the talks and meetings

1277
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:47,270
that gave us so much knowledge

1278
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:50,100
perhaps not later  for everyone but

1279
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:53,250
for some and very necessary to live

1280
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:55,590
these times of pandemic with so many

1281
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:58,260
hours on the internet with so many things that

1282
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:01,050
are happening so the conference is super relevant

1283
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:03,840
a million thanks to

1284
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:06,840
all who supported us as president of

1285
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,420
the gh6 foundation and  I want to

1286
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:12,510
thank the exhibitors who gave their

1287
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:15,600
time to all those who contributed today to

1288
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,450
everything that all our

1289
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:22,380
sponsors attended and to 8.8 for giving us this

1290
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:24,890
possibility of raising funds to

1291
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:27,240
investigate the research in the cures

1292
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,310
that we need so much,

1293
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:32,340
so please  all my heart thank you

1294
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:34,610
all very much it

1295
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,290
is such a strange disease the rate

1296
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:38,820
indicates that it is one of a million and without

1297
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:40,950
e  However, to find a cure for this,

1298
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:42,480
you told me that there is a possible

1299
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,790
parallel to find a cure for

1300
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:46,260
many more ills just

1301
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:48,780
by working on this xi what happens is

1302
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,520
that the most promising thing at this minute is

1303
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:53,520
a genetic therapy and achieving that

1304
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,800
technique that is a technique in the background

1305
00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:00,180
to remedy a functional ingentis

1306
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:01,890
that could work for many other

1307
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:03,960
rare diseases that also have

1308
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,510
a genetic cause that is why we say that

1309
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:08,100
supporting us is not only

1310
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:10,080
supporting ourselves and supporting many

1311
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,520
rare diseases that could

1312
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,440
benefit from  cure of this

1313
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,300
disease or the invitation is that

1314
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,590
we are carrying out projects for this

1315
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:19,260
disease during the year how they

1316
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:20,520
can get closer to people if

1317
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,140
they also want to collaborate and participate

1318
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:24,240
with the foundation we will make a

1319
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,690
website called triple-double

1320
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:31,440
foundation  hc chile punto org I'm sorry

1321
