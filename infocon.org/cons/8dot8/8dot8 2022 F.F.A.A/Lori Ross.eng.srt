and cyber security welcome laurie thank

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,840
you for being with us today it's honor

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,399
and honor for us to have you here

19
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,399
wonderful thank you lisa thank you so

20
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,119
much for having me and good afternoon to

21
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,479
everyone

22
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,679
today i'm glad cyber

23
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,479
five myths about cyber protections of

24
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,400
control systems

25
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,040
and i'm going to focus on a case study

26
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,200
of work i did with the united states

27
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,400
army

28
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,040
for their renewable installations

29
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,360
and then some lessons learned from this

30
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,439
effort that you could implement into

31
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,400
your

32
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,479
procurement language and finally some

33
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,280
resources that you can have access to to

34
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,320
help you

35
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,479
pursue this um this topic as well

36
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,479
so at least today we're going to go

37
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,399
ahead and skip this slide and go to the

38
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,240
next one

39
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,320
so here in the united states the

40
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,640
department of energy has

41
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,759
here's a picture of how we fit into the

42
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,360
state of washington

43
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,720
and our goal is really to focus on

44
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,959
science and technology capabilities for

45
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,599
the department of energy and to drive

46
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,200
collaboration

47
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,319
to solve these hard problems

48
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,480
so i'm going to start out with a case

49
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,400
study of how a cyber attack had a

50
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,239
physical outcome

51
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,319
back in 2014

52
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,519
a spear phishing email was sent to a

53
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,440
german sport able to

54
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,560
that then transferred over to

55
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,239
the

56
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,519
furnace

57
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,560
network

58
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,480
and control the furnace

59
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,120
of the steel mill and actually cause it

60
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,239
to overheat and damage the steel mill

61
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,640
so this is a very what could maybe have

62
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,680
been done differently or better

63
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,120
if the contract had included some cyber

64
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,360
security language

65
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,800
to protect

66
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,640
a future attack

67
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,519
okay

68
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,400
covers the stages that i will cover in

69
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,159
my presentation

70
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:08,959
so

71
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,959
planning for your procurement what are

72
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,440
the requirements for the procurement

73
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,159
how will you select and evaluate

74
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,480
these submissions from vendors

75
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,480
awarding the contract

76
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,480
and then the largest piece of it is

77
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,360
really managing the contract itself

78
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,599
so i have a note here it says what if

79
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,920
the contract is a lifespan of 20 to

80
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,159
these big control system installations

81
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,360
may last for 20 or 30 years for example

82
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,080
installing a substation

83
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,120
or

84
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,360
a heating and cooling system

85
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,280
or

86
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,400
your electric

87
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,400
dam

88
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,000
and our planning is who might want to

89
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,080
business

90
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,759
make it difficult

91
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,759
function

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,400
this is for their own personal gain

93
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,400
or in this day and age embarrassed

94
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,639
or even

95
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,960
how the public sees the organization

96
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,039
itself and their trust in it

97
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,960
so these are just some of the

98
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,680
motivations an attacker may

99
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,720
have

100
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,199
and in the planning stages of the

101
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,360
contract we need to think about these

102
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
what are we protecting against and how

103
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,639
can we best do that

104
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,440
so

105
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,960
the work that i'm going to talk about

106
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,880
today came about

107
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,479
from some

108
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,120
work we did for the u.s army office of

109
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,960
energy initiatives

110
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,919
so

111
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,960
they were formed back in 2014 and their

112
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,800
goal was to

113
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,759
bring about renewable energy on u.s army

114
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,039
bases

115
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,960
so this is a picture of where those

116
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,879
bases are in the u.s

117
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,599
and what type of renewables each

118
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,599
installation

119
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,720
was

120
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,360
was expected to have

121
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,840
so they may have been wind

122
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,239
solar

123
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,720
those are some of the type of renewables

124
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,240
that each site would have and this is

125
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,599
their goals that they had for the site

126
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,479
um

127
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,639
so the goal of this effort was really to

128
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,280
include cyber security requirements in

129
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,080
contracts and agreements

130
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,600
protect

131
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,720
the army

132
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,080
over the life

133
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,200
of these renewable energy

134
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,680
assets

135
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,160
so

136
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,959
how do we do that

137
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,360
so it's important to think that from the

138
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,839
contractor's perspective

139
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,760
these risks might not be particularly

140
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,360
important to them

141
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,360
but definitely to the base or the

142
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,079
installation this is very important

143
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,800
so we want to look into some myths if

144
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,760
you will

145
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,000
about cyber security

146
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,160
so one of the questions we heard a lot

147
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,399
was well isn't it going to cost a lot of

148
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,839
money to add to this contract

149
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,040
it might

150
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,920
but

151
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,680
building it in at the beginning is

152
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,440
always going to be much cheaper than

153
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,640
trying to

154
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,040
mitigate an attack or

155
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,120
recover from it later on for example

156
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,200
with the german steel mill recovering

157
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
from a physical explosion

158
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,519
and the shutdown of their plant

159
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,240
is much more expensive than if they had

160
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,560
been able to put the security controls

161
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,399
in at the beginning energy systems hard

162
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,920
to figure out

163
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,680
and

164
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,200
and protect

165
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,240
well

166
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,760
it used to be when they were very

167
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,560
proprietary that was the case but many

168
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,959
of these systems are now using common

169
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,800
operating systems like windows and linux

170
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,040
assume there's no connectiveness anymore

171
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,120
there's so much being connected and

172
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,279
finding all those connections can be a

173
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,279
challenge

174
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,240
one of the other myths we heard is

175
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,839
aren't there already protections in

176
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,040
place

177
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,399
well

178
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,200
personally i actually had my improve

179
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,000
their heating and cooling vendor was

180
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,760
able to connect in

181
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,319
to the

182
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,560
business network and so it then

183
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,160
released personal information about

184
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,000
shoppers so

185
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,240
while you hope there is on the vendor to

186
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,279
protect

187
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,200
themselves

188
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,360
and finally the question is aren't there

189
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,279
already requirements in place for

190
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,720
utilities

191
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,079
so

192
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,000
here in the u.s we have the north

193
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,560
american electric liability corporation

194
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,480
which is doing a great job of focusing

195
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,800
on safety and cyber security

196
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,079
would not fall under this requirement

197
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,320
um

198
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,920
as well as

199
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,160
they focus on the protection of the

200
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,399
substation and the grid they're not

201
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,079
focusing on the protection of the

202
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,279
consumer

203
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,279
so we really needed to take the

204
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,199
consumer's view and how to protect the

205
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,920
consumer in this case of the energies

206
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,920
received

207
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,160
what we did is we were developing

208
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,440
requirements

209
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,440
in scenarios or use cases if you will

210
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,800
that

211
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,079
could be

212
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,160
considered for this work

213
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,240
and we came up with two possible

214
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,040
scenarios that vendors might propose or

215
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,360
could be used at various installations

216
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,760
one of the first ones is if the power is

217
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,800
purchased directly from the utility

218
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,279
example the utility has a renewable

219
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,480
power source such as solar or

220
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,360
wind

221
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,160
and

222
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,680
they purchase

223
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,519
the army purchases their power just like

224
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,839
maybe you receive power at your own home

225
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:44,959
or business

226
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:45,920
it's

227
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,320
it's no special requirement for the army

228
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,720
it's not connected to the army's network

229
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,399
or their devices

230
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,399
and really the army is treated like any

231
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,160
other customer

232
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,120
so in this case the utility's internal

233
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,839
cybersecurity program applies

234
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,320
but it may not be secure enough

235
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,320
for example maybe

236
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,240
the army's data

237
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,920
just like your data

238
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,600
is being

239
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,160
uploaded to the cloud

240
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,279
and that data maybe is available to

241
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,240
others

242
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,199
that

243
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,839
access to that data

244
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,920
and by looking at say their energy

245
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,399
consumption somebody could infer what

246
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,120
goes on at that installation

247
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,639
or what the mission is

248
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,560
as a

249
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,639
as an army site they certainly don't

250
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,720
want any information shared with the

251
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,040
public until they want it to happen so

252
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,480
protecting their data and their

253
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,759
information

254
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,360
is key

255
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,040
they certainly don't want their data

256
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,040
intermingled with other consumers

257
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,519
okay

258
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,480
the next scenario we came up with was

259
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,240
what if the utility actually resides

260
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,639
on the army base so are there any

261
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,279
special requirements there so example

262
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,000
would be if a solar array or a wind farm

263
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,680
is installed on the army base

264
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,920
so we talked about

265
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,839
the north american electric reliability

266
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,240
council and their regulations

267
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,160
but these are very small installations

268
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,079
so they would not apply so there's no

269
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,360
protection requirement there

270
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,240
they may need to connect to the bases

271
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,880
network or their own devices or maybe a

272
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,639
database

273
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,720
maybe the utility needs to have

274
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,120
personnel that have physical access to

275
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,160
the base

276
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,160
and they need to come in and work on the

277
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,279
equipment

278
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,800
so now they have

279
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,880
people coming into the base

280
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,959
that are not based personnel to do this

281
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,959
work

282
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,279
um

283
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,519
so what we had to do was establish a

284
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,759
risk-based cybersecurity requirements

285
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,440
for the installation

286
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,240
and look at these privately owned energy

287
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,279
assets

288
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,759
and to determine what would be the best

289
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,319
fit for the army in thinking about these

290
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,520
things

291
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,199
so

292
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,359
so the approach we used

293
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,039
was was to take that risk-based approach

294
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,640
and we narrowed it down to four

295
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,839
areas that we wanted to focus on

296
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,319
so the first one was the loss or

297
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,000
function fluctuation of electrical power

298
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,080
which could result in brown outs

299
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,799
blackouts or damage to the installation

300
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,160
so that would be

301
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,840
the green box over there on the right

302
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,000
the next of the four we looked at was

303
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,919
could there be physical damage to the

304
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,200
installation such as fire explosion

305
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,160
and that's the red box over there on the

306
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,919
right so physical damage to the

307
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,400
installation

308
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,039
the third thing we looked at was direct

309
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,360
or indirect connections between the

310
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,799
energy system

311
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,120
and the installation of the base

312
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,639
so could there be

313
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,240
attack vector there for a cyber attack

314
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,200
either accidentally or intentionally

315
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,520
so that's the brown box over on the

316
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,918
right a director indirect connection

317
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,000
and then the last one is after

318
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,960
manipulation of data in order to monitor

319
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,039
or jeopardize the installation or the

320
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,679
operation so that's the blue box there

321
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,120
on the right

322
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,640
so then we

323
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,799
developed what we call the risk profile

324
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,080
so if you see

325
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,120
the table in the bottom left hand corner

326
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,600
there's a wrist profile showing those

327
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,760
four colored boxes

328
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,880
and i realize it's it's hard to read

329
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,559
but the columns are then

330
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,360
a description of what could occur

331
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,000
if it is a nominal

332
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,480
moderate or high risk

333
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,559
and so we try to assess each

334
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,320
installation

335
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,840
and determine

336
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,959
would one of these

337
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,520
be a nominal a moderate or a high risk

338
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,679
and based on that then

339
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,360
we come up with what we call our

340
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,000
resulting risk rating

341
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,760
so you'll see the box in the lower right

342
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,640
hand corner with the colored columns so

343
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,559
those four risks

344
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,960
and then um

345
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,160
the level that in this this example

346
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,200
the risk rating was set at for each of

347
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,160
those

348
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,720
so because of each installation has a

349
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,400
specific mission

350
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,799
and they may have different types of

351
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,120
renewable energy and different

352
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,760
connection methods each site was

353
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,200
initially

354
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,679
evaluated individually

355
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,400
to determine the resulting risk rating

356
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,640
and that was really the starting point

357
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,480
for evaluating and selecting which

358
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,200
solution was presented by a contractor

359
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,080
would be the best fit

360
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,440
okay

361
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,120
the other thing we did when we were

362
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,919
looking at requirements was what type of

363
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,880
cyber security requirements are out

364
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,799
there currently

365
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,000
so here in the u.s we typically use the

366
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
national institute of standards and

367
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,240
technology or nist

368
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,080
which has developed

369
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,960
many

370
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,400
guidance

371
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,360
and we identified

372
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,000
that we wanted the

373
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,440
did as well

374
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,559
and implemented those as required by

375
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,760
each site

376
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,960
so so we took a lot of different things

377
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,840
and

378
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,918
really tried to simplify it

379
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,320
so here's a here's another approach to

380
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,880
this another picture so we actually

381
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,360
started building on work that occurred

382
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,200
in 2009

383
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,440
the department of homeland security had

384
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,080
actually developed an initial document

385
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,559
on cyber security procurement language

386
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,880
from procurement language

387
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,679
so in 2014 the department of energy was

388
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,480
interested in what is

389
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,080
we built on that with the

390
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,919
generally accepted guidance that

391
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,600
provided by nist and department of

392
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,120
defense

393
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,600
and after several iterations

394
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,159
we came up with the final version that's

395
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,000
currently being used by the army in 2019

396
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,480
which is cyber security requirements for

397
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,200
third-party energy generating assets

398
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,280
which you'll see on the far right there

399
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,200
and that is what the army

400
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,159
so

401
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,240
the current cybersecurity landscape was

402
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,559
considered and included in the resulting

403
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,400
cyber procurement clauses we took a

404
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,360
holistic approach

405
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,880
and it provides a concise set of

406
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,440
requirements that tell utility

407
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,840
this example we give six steps i think

408
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,200
they're all great

409
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,880
but they could pick and choose the ones

410
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,200
they wanted based on the uniqueness of

411
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,039
the installation

412
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,880
so in this case they need to implement

413
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,960
and maintain supply chain security

414
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,159
program establish document and implement

415
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,279
the security risk management practices

416
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,120
specify how digital delivery for

417
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,200
procured products will be validated and

418
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,640
monitored

419
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,279
use trusted channels to ship critical

420
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,159
energy delivery system hardware

421
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,240
implement capability for detecting

422
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,000
unauthorized access

423
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,240
the sixth step which is to provide

424
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,640
additional vetting of the processes and

425
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,080
security practice they have

426
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,679
subcontractors

427
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,159
they're expected to be at the same high

428
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,480
level

429
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,679
so

430
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,840
in summary i wanted to share with you

431
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,600
some of the lessons we learned through

432
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,960
this process

433
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,440
and i'm hoping that some will be useful

434
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,600
for your work as well

435
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,440
so this have to do with the planning

436
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,000
stage of a procurement life cycle the

437
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,240
number one thing we realized is we have

438
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,600
to including

439
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,760
they need to help design the language

440
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,600
for the request for bids or the

441
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,960
proposals

442
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,760
because on the other end the contractors

443
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,440
are going to have their cybersecurity

444
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,440
people interpreting this as well so we

445
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,000
need to speak their language

446
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,559
we need to establish and adhere to cyber

447
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,880
security evaluation criteria

448
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,679
so we need a consistent rubric by which

449
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,159
to evaluate all the bids

450
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,400
but they need to have cyber security

451
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,640
included in the evaluation process as

452
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,799
well

453
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,120
we also need to include cyber security

454
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,559
people in the review and selection too

455
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,120
it can't just be contracts personnel

456
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,200
that make the selection we need to

457
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,400
include subject matter experts

458
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,320
and we need to include cyber security

459
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,559
requirements in all the contracts and

460
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:31,679
agreements

461
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,159
to protect you the consumer

462
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,000
from cyber security risk from third

463
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,480
parties of the systems installed at your

464
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,799
site

465
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,120
so some lessons from the contract award

466
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,840
phase that you might find useful is

467
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,080
including the topic of cyber security in

468
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,240
conversations with the vendors and

469
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,400
stresses importance

470
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,440
we actually visited sites with the

471
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,919
vendors and talked to them

472
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,000
and brought cyber security professionals

473
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,240
along with the contracts people

474
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,080
so

475
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,159
cyber people could talk to cyber people

476
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,480
and they could speak the same language

477
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,039
and also to stress to the the possible

478
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,440
vendors how important this was this was

479
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,600
not something that was a simply to check

480
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,480
the box exercise this was something we

481
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,640
expected throughout the life cycle

482
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,720
we would also want that the um

483
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,200
that we'd have cyber security experts

484
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,679
assigned for the life of the project so

485
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,000
remember that these could be 20 or 30

486
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,080
year long projects so that means it's

487
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,240
going to have to be passed possibly from

488
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,320
cyber security person to cyber security

489
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,279
person

490
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,120
throughout the life cycle of this

491
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,120
installation

492
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,440
so and review and providing feedback on

493
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,760
the vendor's cybersecurity program and

494
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,240
how it extends to your systems

495
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,919
so most companies do have a

496
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,679
cybersecurity program for their

497
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,159
corporate or business networks

498
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,480
but how many look at it

499
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,960
into their operational or industrial

500
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,279
control systems networks if they're

501
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,679
providers of those services are they

502
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,919
providing cyber security

503
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,279
as part of their cybersecurity program

504
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,880
to those capabilities as well

505
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,480
so we

506
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,240
highly recommend that there's a cyber

507
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,880
security program and a cyber security

508
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,960
plan and that those are reviewed

509
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,320
regularly

510
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,880
by a cyber security person

511
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,279
uh they can ask probing questions the

512
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,679
exceptions that not every security

513
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,320
control can be implemented for whatever

514
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,279
reason

515
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,480
that's okay

516
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,039
we just need to have a mitigating

517
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,760
approach what will we do as a security

518
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,960
control instead to protect those systems

519
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,159
so i think we talked about already it's

520
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,159
important that most have a corporate

521
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,320
security program but how will they

522
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,640
protect you as the consumer or you as

523
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,279
the receiver of those services

524
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,679
those that's where it's very important

525
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:06,880
to

526
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,320
consider

527
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,039
your protection

528
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,559
we also want to ensure that cyber

529
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,480
security experts are included in the

530
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,000
design and installation of the system

531
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,080
my experience there was

532
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,200
they weren't

533
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,440
the those that

534
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,279
designed the systems

535
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,480
had a way they did it it was often

536
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,640
how they'd always been doing it and when

537
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,480
we asked to include cyber people they

538
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,399
were often confused about what value

539
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,159
that could add

540
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,159
and so it was an educational process on

541
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,480
both sides understanding how the design

542
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,480
and development of the system

543
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,279
occurred but also

544
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,840
could we make it safer from a digital

545
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,279
perspective

546
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,760
often safety is included

547
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,840
from the perspective of protection of

548
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,720
of humans and the physical installation

549
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,320
but we also wanted to protect the

550
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,799
digital asset itself

551
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,320
and the data of the system

552
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:07,520
and then

553
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,200
also ensuring that there's cyber

554
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,760
security extends to the subcontractors

555
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,159
as well it's not just

556
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,559
uh to the prime contractor many

557
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,520
contractors have subcontractors

558
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,240
uh and providers and and vendors that

559
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,240
they receive services from

560
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,559
so ensuring that this

561
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,720
approach extends all the way through the

562
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,039
contract to all the

563
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,960
um

564
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,679
participating parties

565
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,279
and then finally the contract management

566
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,520
itself remember this contract is going

567
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,799
to last a long long time it could last

568
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,080
30 years

569
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:46,799
so

570
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,600
how do we ensure that there's continuity

571
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,440
from the cyber security people that

572
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,440
helped implement this to those that are

573
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,039
going to maintain it

574
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,919
so we need to have a process on

575
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,559
on our side to do that

576
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,399
we also like to have a

577
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:05,039
a third party do an evaluation of the

578
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,440
installed system annually somebody who

579
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,720
can look at it

580
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,799
and bring a fresh set eyes and be sure

581
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,480
that we're doing everything to keep it

582
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,480
safe

583
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,279
requiring reporting of cyber weaknesses

584
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,559
so

585
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,960
have some clause in your contract that

586
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,480
requires that they

587
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,480
report

588
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,200
um

589
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,360
once the report is made and what type of

590
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,159
remediation to it recover from the

591
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,720
attack is expected so these are

592
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,159
important things to be thinking about

593
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:16,120
before the contract goes

594
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,360
just going through a checklist and

595
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,000
checking a box that we did cyber

596
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,240
is not as important as continuously

597
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,799
monitoring and ensuring that the cyber

598
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:38,320
security is being kept up to date and

599
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,600
monitored and acted upon so it's easy to

600
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,320
fall into a compliance

601
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,640
mindset when really we need to stay with

602
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,799
a continuous monitoring and improvement

603
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,399
mindset when it comes to cyber

604
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,559
don't vendors charge you for cyber

605
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,799
security when you buy part of the

606
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,640
contract itself not as a luxury item

607
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,799
and then finally ensuring that your

608
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:05,760
cyber all cyber related reporting is

609
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,560
reviewed by cyber security experts not

610
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,399
just contract staff

611
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,960
i was on a project where the contracts

612
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,800
people reviewed everything that was in

613
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,960
the contract such as the cyber security

614
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,839
plan

615
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:22,000
reporting the annual assessment

616
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,320
and they received them

617
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,800
they checked and they paid the vendor

618
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,040
no subject matter and in the life cycle

619
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,399
of the contract itself

620
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,320
and thank you for your time today i

621
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,480
appreciate you listening to me talk

622
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,000
about this cyber security process of um

623
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
in the procurement process

624
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,199
and

625
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,599
at the very last slide i as promised i

626
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,520
had a list of resources

627
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,199
of work

628
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,119
documenting the work we have done along

629
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,879
with the nist documentation as well

630
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:59,319
thank you very much for your time today

631
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,640
thank you so much lori for being with us

632
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,480
it's been most interesting

633
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,240
i think it's

634
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,720
i i'm i'm gonna ask now if we have any

635
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,078
questions in the chats

636
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,720
but

637
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,160
it was

638
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,480
very clear

639
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,400
i think it was very clear

640
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,400
so

641
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,960
thank you so much for having me i

642
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,720
greatly appreciate it

643
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,040
