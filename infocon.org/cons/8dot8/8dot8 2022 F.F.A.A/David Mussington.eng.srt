assistant director the ead for the

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,400
infrastructure security division at the

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,359
department of homeland security's cyber

7
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,840
security and infrastructure security

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,880
agency called sisa as of february 2021

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,239
as ead he helped lead csa's efforts to

10
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,160
secure the nation's critical

11
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,160
infrastructure in coordination with

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,719
government and the private sector

13
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,160
his priorities for isd include

14
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,760
vulnerability and risk assessments

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,879
securing soft targets and crowded bases

16
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,520
training and exercises and securing

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,760
high-risk chemical facilities

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,640
david welcome to 8.8

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,360
versus atmas in spanish we're so happy

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,159
to have you here with us today

21
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,479
and i'll turn over the word to you

22
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:11,760
all right thank you thank you so much

23
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,280
lisa and thanks for the invitation to

24
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,159
speak

25
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,040
um

26
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,040
i'm gonna try and keep this short so

27
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,040
there'll be some time for questions

28
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,799
um

29
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,280
no i don't assume anyone knows what sisa

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,439
does so i'm gonna be describing that and

31
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,119
then describing some

32
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,040
concerns and risks that we think about a

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,560
lot um so first

34
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,400
i'm david mussington

35
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,840
long title for a very specific job

36
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,880
cesa's split into more than two big

37
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,200
parts but the two largest parts are the

38
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,200
cyber security side of the house

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,360
and infrastructure security side i i

40
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,200
leave the critical infrastructure

41
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,600
security part of cisa which is physical

42
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,240
and cyber security and risk management

43
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,240
it's three years old

44
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,719
and so three years ago

45
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,960
the us congress decided to create a new

46
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,520
agency that was solely concerned with

47
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,840
critical infrastructure security cyber

48
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,479
security cyber risks and outreach to

49
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,959
industry he did that for a few reasons

50
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,120
um after all the critical infrastructure

51
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,760
role existed much longer than the last

52
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,120
three years it's been

53
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,319
in existence for

54
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,640
about 20 years um

55
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,000
the real concern that we weren't making

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,400
progress fast enough we weren't actually

57
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,200
protecting critical infrastructure from

58
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,360
escalating risk from all sorts of

59
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,000
different actors from nation state to

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,879
to criminals to other people in between

61
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,640
to proxies who work for nation states

62
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,760
and criminals

63
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,040
so the idea was new agency new mission

64
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,800
um new

65
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,000
problem set and a new set of solutions

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,800
um

67
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,760
so we're we're fashioned as the nation's

68
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,160
cyber and infrastructure defense agency

69
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,560
now that's different than protection

70
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,599
alone

71
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,000
defense has a connotation of proactive

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,280
action

73
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,400
as well as um

74
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,840
as well as

75
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,599
outreach and that's really what we're

76
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,920
about we're a civilian agency the part

77
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,440
of the department of homeland security

78
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,519
not part of the defense department

79
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,280
we do however try and think

80
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,959
systematically about what it takes to

81
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,519
defend critical infrastructures at scale

82
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,920
not simply one critical company or one

83
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,400
critical bridge or tunnel but the

84
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,599
countries

85
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,319
bridges and tunnels and critical um

86
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,640
industrial economic resources that keep

87
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,080
the country functioning keep the

88
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,519
government functioning

89
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,599
so that's why we're the nation's

90
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,680
cyber infrastructure defense agency and

91
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,879
we're part of the department of homeland

92
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,720
security we're central

93
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,959
we have we do however

94
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,640
lack almost

95
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,319
well we're completely lacking in

96
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,480
authority so how do we execute our

97
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,319
mission we execute it through instead of

98
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,920
public private partnerships we're not

99
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,840
supposed to be a traditional government

100
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,599
agency there's a lot of criticism in the

101
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,519
united states about what government

102
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,519
agencies constitute uh whether we're

103
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,519
efficient or not so we're designed to be

104
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,879
a hybrid public private institution

105
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,319
we've got the agency built on our

106
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,400
foundation of collaboration cooperation

107
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,400
information sharing and action across

108
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,239
public and private sectors

109
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,319
and the with international partners

110
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,358
that's the heart of our goal of raising

111
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,720
and enhancing collective cyber defense

112
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,560
so the two main roles just to be

113
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,080
specific are

114
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,680
we service the operational lead for

115
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,840
federal government cyber security and we

116
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,360
serve as the national coordinator for

117
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,040
critical infrastructures do you guys

118
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,040
have 16 critical infrastructures i don't

119
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,800
know how many uh infrastructure critical

120
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,960
infrastructures chile has most countries

121
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,840
have less than 16 in a few few months we

122
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,160
may have less than 16. i'll get to that

123
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,639
in a few minutes but our mission is to

124
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,040
to lead the national effort coordinating

125
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,160
between infrastructure owner operators

126
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,320
and government entities at the state and

127
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,400
local level that

128
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,400
collectively oversee critical

129
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,040
infrastructure risk management

130
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,240
so we're tasked with some of the biggest

131
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,680
challenges facing both government in

132
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,360
industry from securing large federal

133
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,120
networks or

134
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,520
federal civilian agencies i should add

135
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,639
um

136
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,320
and doing cyber incident response

137
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,720
assistance to private organizations that

138
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,160
need to secure critical industrial

139
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,240
control systems

140
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,160
but you know to gen more generally says

141
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,160
it was created and designed to work

142
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,840
across the public private sectors to

143
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,680
help secure the nation's critical

144
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,960
infrastructure

145
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,919
that includes everything from

146
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,440
um cyber threats that threaten dams

147
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,479
to

148
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,120
all hazards natural disaster climate

149
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,479
change related infrastructure

150
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,160
disruptions the threat and the delivery

151
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,320
of critical services

152
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,000
as we work to address these threats and

153
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,680
hazards

154
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,160
have adopted a holistic approach against

155
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,160
all hazards all risks not simply

156
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,919
cyberists even though the cyber risks

157
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:50,560
are

158
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,560
the center of gravity for my comments

159
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,759
today we prioritize systemic risks to

160
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,440
critical infrastructure that is those

161
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,319
risks that scale from a single event to

162
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,280
a broad sectoral or national impact so

163
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,280
that's what we mean by critical systems

164
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,560
and that's what we mean by securing

165
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,479
critical functions so some of those

166
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,479
critical systems are you know wasting

167
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:11,680
water waste

168
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,960
water waste

169
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,039
uh water and water treatment systems

170
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,160
transportation systems energy systems

171
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,680
and

172
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,319
systems among others

173
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,600
now as we learned from the recent

174
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,520
colonial pipeline ransomware attacks

175
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,360
that you may have read about and seen in

176
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,039
the media successful attack on a

177
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,880
critical system or function can block

178
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,960
vital services to an entire segment of

179
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,199
society even if the attack itself is not

180
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,280
particularly novel a trial ransomware is

181
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,720
fairly well known

182
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,440
effective cyber security requires that

183
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,280
we pay attention to

184
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,000
attacks that give asymmetric empowerment

185
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,759
or power to the attacker that's what

186
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,240
ransomware does by denying access to

187
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,800
critical systems at colonial

188
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,720
oil and energy supplies on the east

189
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,680
coast of the united states were

190
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,319
disrupted prices increased gas lines

191
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,479
increased and

192
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,240
actual price inflation increase for a

193
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,400
short period of time

194
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,080
now were those attacks launched from the

195
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,560
united states maybe don't know could

196
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,759
they have been launched from anywhere

197
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,919
else definitely because of internet

198
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,160
connectivity that's why

199
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,520
um from a whole set of different vectors

200
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,520
critical infrastructure cyber security

201
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,680
is one of those national concerns that

202
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,160
gets federal attention in the u.s

203
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,759
if the last year's told us anything

204
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,520
because it wasn't alone

205
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,680
it's that

206
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,720
um attacks can have complex consequences

207
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,840
and that's

208
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,880
that simplicity to complexity uh dynamic

209
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,280
is another focus of cissa

210
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,000
now to uh to attack those particular

211
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,840
kinds of problems

212
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,160
offers fairly mundane advice but with a

213
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,000
complex kicker at the end so i'll go

214
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,160
through what the mundane advice is then

215
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,319
i'll give you the complex uh underlying

216
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,840
point

217
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,199
first we encourage the international

218
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,639
partners in our critical infrastructure

219
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,400
sectors to adopt more stringent cyber

220
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,319
security practices protecting and

221
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,160
maintaining their cyber request cyber

222
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,840
operations that means that we don't

223
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,800
assume

224
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,960
that um

225
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,039
our partners are better or worse than us

226
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,560
in cyber hygiene

227
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,400
we certainly don't claim to be the best

228
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,639
um no one who looks at our history of

229
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,520
cyber

230
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,680
um disruptions and ransomware issues

231
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,199
could consider us better than other

232
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,199
people but we do have some experience in

233
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,840
terms of uh cyber hygiene and and best

234
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,000
practices forest management we try and

235
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,639
share that and we try and learn from

236
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,280
from the experiences of others who are

237
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,360
similar history with operating critical

238
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,039
infrastructure to a similar journey of

239
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,640
confronting risks that

240
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,958
go from the simple to the complex so

241
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,919
using basic cyber hygiene habits like

242
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,399
multi-factor authentication

243
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,959
up-to-date anti-virus software strong

244
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,240
passwords

245
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,160
network segmentation other best

246
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,720
practices is where we start

247
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,560
it means being vigilant against phishing

248
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,399
attempts things that this audience knows

249
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,240
well but things that are often not done

250
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,480
well in industry or in government so we

251
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,720
focus there first to try and get the

252
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,120
foundations correct before we build more

253
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,360
sophisticated mitigation risk management

254
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,839
principles

255
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,680
second we look at supply chains vendor

256
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,360
supply chains vendor relationships when

257
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,959
we try and ask

258
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,760
um what best practices or principles

259
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,080
guide what one needs to know about

260
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,519
suppliers in fact we've actually

261
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,360
translated many of these cyber hygiene

262
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,440
tips into spanish on our website

263
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,600
scissor.gov

264
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,640
so we're sharing outwardly proactively

265
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,519
with partners and we

266
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,360
seek in return

267
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,600
for partners to share with us after all

268
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,040
we can all learn from each other's risk

269
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,640
experience even if things aren't exactly

270
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,839
the same attackers who go one kind of

271
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,000
target in one country often use the same

272
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,760
techniques somewhere else

273
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,040
so

274
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,120
in sharing these baseline techniques

275
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,720
it's about we think raising the

276
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,279
security-based line of products as

277
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,920
they're integrated into complex systems

278
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,399
as that's done in one place that shared

279
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,800
defense and pro protective experience

280
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,600
can add to the um safety and security of

281
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,760
others make the internet a somewhat

282
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,079
safer place not a safe place but a safe

283
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,000
but a safer place

284
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,200
next thing we emphasize is teamwork

285
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,360
teamwork information sharing because we

286
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,279
emphasize um collaboration and

287
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,440
partnership we have to emphasize that on

288
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,279
the basis of a common information for a

289
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,200
common information base what we know

290
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,360
about threat needs to be parallel what

291
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,959
we know about risk needs to be parallel

292
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,720
what we know about mitigations and best

293
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,880
practices needs to be parallel each of

294
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,240
those things are shared in different

295
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,560
international and overlapping forum from

296
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,200
industry uh conferences to direct

297
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,440
bilateral relationships like the one

298
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,120
sisa has with parts of mli in chile

299
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,880
so the notion is

300
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,200
share situational awareness on risk

301
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,440
shared or experienced shared awareness

302
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,440
of the techniques used by attackers

303
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,920
including criminals in nation states

304
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,480
that leads to shared ability to

305
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,920
understand trends

306
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,760
and critical infrastructure risks

307
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,079
and a shared ability to hopefully

308
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,560
integrate collective defense collective

309
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,160
cyber defensive critical infrastructure

310
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,680
is something that says is paying a lot

311
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,200
of attention to a new international

312
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,519
strategy that i mentioned shortly but it

313
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,000
also means leveraging the strengths and

314
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,920
access to other people

315
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,000
in the us can be everywhere says i

316
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,320
certainly can be everywhere we're small

317
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,760
approximately three thousand people in

318
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,399
our our unc so we leverage

319
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,399
by definition the strengths of the

320
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,320
private sector and of our citizens and

321
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,240
our international partners teamwork

322
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,079
central to achieving secure and

323
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,399
resilient infrastructure uh cyber

324
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,320
security because you need to be

325
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,800
persistently good not just good around

326
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,959
specific incidents

327
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:45,920
so

328
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,000
once you have that baseline of shared

329
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,680
threat security information and

330
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,240
mitigation advice the question is what's

331
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,279
next uh what's next is the ability to

332
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,440
model based on

333
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,560
data

334
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,720
the prospective behavior of adversaries

335
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,079
you seek to exploit critical

336
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,079
infrastructure that means applying

337
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,079
machine learning artificial intelligence

338
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,480
and some in simulations of critical

339
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,560
infrastructure trying to anticipate the

340
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,639
ttps the tactics techniques and

341
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,800
procedures all the adversaries so that

342
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,000
you can get a little bit ahead of the

343
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,240
game after all defenses at a

344
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,720
disadvantage in cyberspace what that

345
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,639
means is that we have to be smarter and

346
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,519
faster and leaner that means proactive

347
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,200
exploration of vulnerabilities

348
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,480
vulnerability management and

349
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,480
exploitation pathways trying to

350
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,680
anticipate where bad guys will go

351
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,800
if

352
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,720
cyber defenses are

353
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,040
in some way weakened or not present at

354
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,560
all

355
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,720
next point cyber security's view says

356
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,040
there's a shared responsibility i want

357
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,760
to stress that shared responsibility

358
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,720
that means

359
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,600
that

360
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,680
which governara parts of cyberspace

361
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,120
there are different national laws and

362
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,000
traditions and culture

363
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,480
because of the links within the internet

364
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,880
and within critical infrastructure and

365
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,880
networks that are connected to the

366
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,839
internet

367
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,680
vulnerability in one place can be

368
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,440
exploited from another jurisdiction or

369
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,160
another country that means that securing

370
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,600
critical infrastructure the collective

371
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,040
responsibility

372
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,000
and

373
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,320
has to be collective in order to one to

374
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,320
create the potential for sustained

375
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,160
success there's no way that you can

376
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,639
achieve persistently better defenses

377
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,320
without collaborating with neighbors who

378
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,959
have the ability to compel in some cases

379
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,720
better cyber security practices or their

380
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,880
critical infrastructure partners

381
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,800
so again back to teamwork teamwork

382
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,880
between jurisdictions and governments

383
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,880
teamwork between jurisdictions and

384
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,360
companies teamwork between companies and

385
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,880
their customers

386
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,519
each leveraging cyber hygiene and

387
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,160
enhanced situational awareness to make

388
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,000
the defensive problem a little bit more

389
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,480
attractive

390
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,440
to some points about solar wind pulse

391
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,360
secure and colonial pipeline each of

392
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,920
these are cases where ransomware or

393
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,560
malware launched from outside the united

394
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,720
states was able to

395
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,600
compromise key systems and disrupt the

396
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,839
delivery of key services

397
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,000
those intrusions have penetrated the

398
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,079
public mind after all cyber security and

399
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,240
cyber risks have been in for those in

400
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,480
the business have been a common concern

401
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,000
for a decade or two

402
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,839
um most of the public however

403
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,519
considerably less than two decades worth

404
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,279
of experience dealing with these too

405
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,360
many of them it's a surprise to many of

406
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,199
them they're wondering why it is that

407
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,160
they're critical infrastructure

408
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,199
vulnerable

409
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,800
who it is is responsible for those

410
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,560
vulnerabilities and what it is that we

411
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,920
can do about it

412
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,160
this means having a more

413
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,320
grown-up conversation with the public

414
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,920
with public's republics

415
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,760
and with political leaders

416
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,959
about

417
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,720
where accountability lies or

418
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,519
vulnerability exploitation and says i

419
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,760
have a particular philosophy about this

420
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,160
we are we aren't for blaming victims

421
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,680
victims or victims

422
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,920
the attackers those who all who through

423
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,760
unauthorized means break into systems

424
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,600
they don't heard and access data they

425
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,199
have no right to

426
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,440
um either because the data is

427
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,040
economically valuable

428
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,880
because of reputation they want to do it

429
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,040
because that's what they do

430
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,399
or they're doing it on behalf of the

431
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,480
foreign intelligence service of another

432
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,279
country each category the technique can

433
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,639
be um the same but the driving trigger

434
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,720
for the behavior can be different

435
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,959
from the defensive side in the private

436
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,880
sector their problem is that there are a

437
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,240
lot of people interested in exploiting

438
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,759
their vulnerabilities

439
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,440
from the governmental side our problem

440
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,360
is that we need to be able to categorize

441
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,800
and

442
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,639
classify

443
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,880
who an attacker is and we need to

444
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,519
to align the appropriate um risk

445
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,360
mitigation response risk management

446
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,399
response

447
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,279
um our policy approach is about risk

448
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,360
reduction not just management we're not

449
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,120
about preserving the ability of

450
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,279
attackers to enter vulnerable critical

451
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,199
infrastructure we want to do is improve

452
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,240
and enhance those critical

453
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,600
infrastructures so they're less

454
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,000
exploitable again that means that

455
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,480
cooperating with other countries

456
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,759
to both

457
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,720
access their risk experience help them

458
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,720
craft better defenses but also allow

459
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,920
them to

460
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,279
deny

461
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,120
access to their critical infrastructures

462
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,120
as a jumping off point to attack other

463
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,600
people each of those focuses

464
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,680
are areas where scissor is active

465
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,600
the international collaboration part of

466
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,079
that is a new part of cisa as of last

467
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:26,959
year

468
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,160
and i'll go into that next

469
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,399
so we collaborate regularly regularly

470
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,240
with partner nations on topics of mutual

471
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,160
concern whether it's about exchanging

472
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,279
information

473
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,040
uh significant threats or aligning

474
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,720
policy approaches so to participate

475
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,639
in bilateral and multilateral cyber

476
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,800
security exercises with partner nations

477
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,639
and be interested in exploring those

478
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:51,680
opportunities

479
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,600
with uh chile as well

480
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,199
and we test new procedures in those

481
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,480
exercises

482
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,720
we test procedures for identifying

483
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,680
evolving threats we test um defensive

484
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,400
tactics we text hardening approaches we

485
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,359
test forensic cyber forensic analytic

486
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,720
techniques

487
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,720
and behavioral analysis techniques for

488
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,319
understanding threat behavior at a

489
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,520
distance we found the partnerships very

490
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,640
useful

491
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,959
it allows us to share unclassified and i

492
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,119
emphasize unclassified insights with the

493
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,480
with the private sector which is always

494
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,640
easier than trying to give them a

495
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,400
quick reading into very sensitive

496
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,079
information that they probably

497
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,520
won't have access to

498
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,600
um it also gives us credibility when we

499
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,520
talk to the private sector about risk

500
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,000
insights after all if we say trust us we

501
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,600
can't tell you why we know something but

502
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,000
you have to trust us and act on act

503
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,840
accordingly that's not that's not the

504
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,120
way you build trust

505
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,640
what you thought you built trusted by

506
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,480
shared experience

507
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,400
share sharing of information

508
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,000
interpersonal contacts speaking at

509
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,440
meetings like this one

510
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,480
um

511
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,840
so accessing those exchange venues

512
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,840
conferences by our relationships

513
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,480
um

514
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,280
similar concerns similar victimization

515
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,880
after all

516
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,320
we have cyber

517
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,240
cyber security incidents that affect

518
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,080
critical infrastructure such as chile so

519
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,160
to other countries

520
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,720
both in the c5 which is sort of the u.s

521
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,160
and its principal allies getting

522
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,200
together or in the u.n or with the eu or

523
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,640
through nato and atlantic treaty

524
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,559
organization or through other

525
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,000
international collaborations or

526
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,400
like-minded countries a lot of that

527
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,440
exchange takes place on a cert to cert

528
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,720
um level um on a cyber security

529
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,120
department or ministry to ministry level

530
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,440
uh but also in conferences like this

531
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,799
where a responsible official

532
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,520
will to use that to use a sort of

533
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,240
colloquialism in english um put out the

534
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,679
shingle

535
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,160
advertise that you're ready to um i need

536
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,440
to collaborate with people you're ready

537
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,520
to talk to people honestly about threats

538
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,840
and risks that are sharing dilemmas um

539
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,600
and hopefully

540
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,280
mutually gain and collaborate build

541
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,480
trust that way

542
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,080
assistant global is the name of our

543
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,679
global strategy

544
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,240
um which after last year um was blessed

545
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,400
by the by the us congress so i guess

546
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,039
four goals um first goal is to advance

547
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,240
operational cooperation with

548
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,840
international partners i've got to

549
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,280
describe that

550
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,280
a little bit already next goal is to

551
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,880
build international partner capacity

552
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,400
that's for the reason all the reasons

553
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,679
already stated

554
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,280
um someone who defends their own

555
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,280
cyberspace better is less likely to be

556
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,120
victimized by um

557
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,000
by

558
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,760
attackers from their own country and

559
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,799
from their neighbors because they'll

560
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,480
have better capacity they'll also be

561
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,320
more likely to share their own insights

562
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,160
with neighbors after all collective

563
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,880
cyber defense being a shared value

564
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,919
um also allowing knowledge and

565
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,679
techniques cyber hygiene techniques for

566
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,679
example to flow down

567
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,840
to ordinary people and to small

568
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,640
businesses which are the big the big uh

569
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,840
users

570
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,320
biggest demand signal for cyber security

571
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,440
advice

572
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,120
and assistance is small to medium-sized

573
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,640
enterprises in the united states i

574
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,720
believe that may be true truly in chile

575
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,200
it certainly is in europe um that's what

576
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,960
we mean by building partner capacity

577
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,880
you're building partnership capacity at

578
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,400
the corporate level on the governmental

579
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,720
level at the local local level and

580
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,640
ultimately the consumer level so there's

581
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,640
more defensive capacity to impede

582
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,320
attackers as they think to exploit

583
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,159
systems to which they should not have

584
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,400
access and next we want to strengthen

585
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,600
collaboration with international

586
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,360
partners through stakeholder engagement

587
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,039
and outreach that means visits um

588
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,039
diplomatic exchange

589
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,039
and honest conversations between

590
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,960
governments and responsible officials

591
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,799
about the policy dilemmas they they

592
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,520
confront and how they can collectively

593
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,679
or collaboratively advance

594
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:42,960
shared interests

595
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,799
and lastly shaping the global policy

596
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,360
ecosystem after all as i've observed the

597
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,880
ecosystem the internet and cyberspace in

598
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,520
general is a global policy ecosystem not

599
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,520
just a technical substrate that we all

600
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,960
operate on that means a different

601
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,400
country there are different rules on

602
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,440
privacy on bridge notification on

603
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,720
encryption

604
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,440
on permissible materials allowed online

605
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,240
on maldis and misinformation for example

606
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,919
on the ability for

607
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,080
big social media platforms to operate

608
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,159
across border all of that takes place in

609
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,720
the global policy ecosystem that's

610
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,880
that's structured by laws

611
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,880
on governmental

612
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,600
into exchange of what principles drive

613
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,080
those laws in search of shared values

614
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,840
and shared perspectives

615
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,840
can create a more plastic and

616
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,400
consumer and citizen friendly cyberspace

617
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,640
that can advance economic and other

618
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,240
values that we all

619
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,120
share in common

620
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,320
on operational cooperation and by this i

621
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,600
mean

622
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,600
cooperation in the context of specific

623
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,360
incidents or events

624
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,159
um we think that shared situational

625
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,280
awareness is the best best path forward

626
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,400
we want to work with international

627
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,080
partners to advance collective abilities

628
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,000
to maintain continuous situational

629
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,600
awareness of physical and cyber

630
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,600
incidents and emergency communication

631
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,440
issues this will contribute to a

632
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,960
collaborative global environment where

633
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,039
we partners can learn from each other's

634
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,320
mistakes

635
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,960
and hopefully identify emerging risks

636
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,120
and create effective defenses in a more

637
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,480
timely manner

638
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,760
part of this we want to identify

639
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,520
concerns and threats that may impact

640
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,440
critical infrastructure in particular in

641
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,720
order to facilitate an expedited

642
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,320
response to mitigate negative

643
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,960
consequences without misperception after

644
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,000
all critical infrastructures and

645
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,799
their proximity to defense

646
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,559
uh means that

647
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,159
national security and actions you take

648
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,480
to protect national security can breed

649
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,120
mistrust by neighbors what we want to do

650
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,440
is make sure that defensive preparations

651
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,440
are undertaken are understood in their

652
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,520
proper light

653
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,480
that means again deep conversation

654
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,440
exchange and sharing of information

655
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,640
that's easier with some countries and

656
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,679
others

657
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,520
and i won't mention which countries that

658
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,360
i think are harder to deal with but

659
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,400
anyway

660
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,640
just a few examples of what caesar does

661
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,280
for example last week so the partner

662
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,559
with the australian cyber security

663
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,120
center the near the united kingdom's

664
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,960
national cyber security center and the

665
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,400
federal bureau of investigation and

666
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,000
released the joint cyber security

667
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,600
advisory top routinely exploited

668
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,760
vulnerabilities list which details the

669
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,000
top vulnerabilities routinely exposed by

670
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,159
malicious actors from across the world

671
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:23,600
in 2020

672
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,080
and it also includes those being widely

673
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,799
exploited thus far in 2021.

674
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,679
now the list also includes mitigations

675
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,720
for those exploit vulnerabilities the

676
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,120
vulnerabilities are serially exploited

677
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,960
people don't patch them enough or

678
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,039
systems that are configured poorly

679
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,039
remain poorly uh configured for an

680
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,640
extended period of time

681
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,679
by publishing under the collaborative

682
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,120
with these partners a set of risks

683
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,400
mitigations and guidance for how to take

684
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,240
at-risk systems offline before you

685
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,240
restore them more safely to service

686
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,760
we're trying to advance the collective

687
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,760
security of all that's just one example

688
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,120
of the kind of

689
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,520
activity that's this is involved

690
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,360
another example last fall we joined

691
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,400
efforts with the cyber security

692
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,919
authorities of four other nations

693
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,400
australia canada new zealand and the uk

694
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,760
released an advisory on technical

695
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,760
approaches to uncovering and remediating

696
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,600
malicious activity

697
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,960
highlights technical approaches to

698
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,960
uncovering malicious activity includes

699
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,880
mitigation steps according to best

700
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,960
practices purpose of the report is to

701
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,360
enhance incident response among partners

702
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,880
and network administrators along with

703
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,840
serving as a playbook for incident

704
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,960
investigation now each of these reports

705
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,120
are available on cisa.com our domain

706
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,400
there's a lot of other material there

707
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,559
too including self-help tools

708
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,559
analytical tools that allow businesses

709
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,880
and enterprises to understand their own

710
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,320
cyber security in terms of a best

711
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,080
practice framework than this cyber

712
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,919
security frame

713
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,799
so we empower by giving tools we share

714
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,640
information to build share situational

715
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,159
awareness and we give lists that

716
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,039
enable trend analysis or risk uh

717
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,080
exploitation across the world to try and

718
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,720
raise the defensive baseline for all

719
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,880
countries that's what says is about we

720
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,480
want to help build the capacity of our

721
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,640
partners because it contributes to our

722
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,320
own security so it's a very

723
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,559
self-interested um

724
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,159
approach to collaboration sure we want

725
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,799
everybody to have safe cyberspace but we

726
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,559
obviously want ourselves to have shared

727
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,039
cyberspace the best route to that is

728
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,799
through dense collaboration with

729
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,840
neighbors and friends

730
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,360
you know i'm trying to beat over the

731
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,640
head the notion of international

732
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,240
collaboration for a reason because we

733
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,919
want to liaise and support international

734
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,679
partners and develop in their own

735
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,679
capacity because their detection their

736
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,240
better detection is our better detection

737
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,760
their better

738
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,440
better assessment

739
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,600
capability to assess impacts and

740
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,679
interdependency risks is our better

741
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:54,840
assessment

742
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,000
potential in that way um scissors growth

743
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,520
over the last three years is

744
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,320
contributing we think to a more um

745
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,480
policy relevant more risk managed

746
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,159
international cyberspace the

747
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,240
relationships that underlie that

748
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,039
are key to i think

749
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,720
the continuation of the internet and

750
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,320
cyberspace as a

751
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,679
as an agile competitive um

752
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,159
mostly positive environment where

753
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,840
exchange of information and economic

754
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,120
activity can grow i would say you know

755
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,799
personally that it's possible for

756
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,080
cyberspace to be lost to a generation

757
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,679
who don't trust it they don't trust the

758
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,279
informations there

759
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,000
who don't want to deal with the risks of

760
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
identity theft of malware of

761
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
just exploitation of the public sphere

762
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,400
due to criminal activity dominating the

763
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,679
environment that isn't the situation

764
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,400
today the trends aren't that encouraging

765
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,159
proactive action is necessary to

766
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,960
preserve the openness and utility of i.t

767
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,000
as a global ecosystem now the internet

768
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,240
has a specific version of that ecosystem

769
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,640
that facilitates trade defense and

770
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,120
economic growth

771
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,919
so that last part about

772
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,919
a peaceful

773
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,960
agile um technologically advancing

774
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,240
cyberspace is a real policy conundrum

775
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,159
for us or

776
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,080
on the one hand government didn't create

777
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,120
the modern modern internet ecosystem it

778
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,279
participates in it it selectively

779
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,640
regulates it

780
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,240
but it doesn't want to drive out the

781
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,919
innovation from the private sector that

782
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:32,799
makes

783
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,840
makes cyberspace an interesting and

784
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,600
vital part of the global ecosystem

785
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,399
the malware and bad actors do exist

786
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,880
exploitation opportunities exist

787
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,559
the question is what do we do about it

788
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,240
now from our standpoint we value the

789
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,240
partnership with chile in particular as

790
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,559
an example of what we do about it

791
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,000
so

792
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,279
collaborates with the minister of the

793
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,880
interior and public security on an

794
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,399
ongoing basis

795
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:01,840
proud to participate alongside the

796
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,919
ministry of interior and public security

797
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,240
during the oas cyber security awareness

798
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,840
campaign in october to demonstrate

799
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,679
regional cooperation

800
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,399
and we value chile active participating

801
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,320
collaboration information sharing

802
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,039
through oas certs certain americans

service

805
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,760
you know we commend chile's active

806
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,360
participation collaboration in the asia

807
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,440
pacific economic cooperation security

and prosperity steering group

809
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,640
and

810
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,240
you know we want to expand and deepen

811
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,480
that um in the development of cyber

812
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,000
security exercise instant response

813
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,679
protocol guidance to transnational

814
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,480
cybersecurity incidents all of those um

815
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,919
efforts to to build capacity commonality

816
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,520
harmonization of

817
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,279
sea certs insert

818
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,480
protocols

819
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,039
uh add to that more

820
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,640
governed but more open cyberspace where

821
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,720
malware and bad actor behavior sure it

822
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,399
exists

823
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,240
but it doesn't dominate in a way that

824
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,919
some fear that it might dominate if we

825
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,559
are if we don't get this right

826
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,320
so as we look to address shared risks

827
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,840
and common threats senator wants to

828
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,760
expand the collaboration with chile with

829
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,679
the armed services and with others in

830
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:10,960
the chilean government he'd be

831
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,960
interested in working with us uh to

832
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,080
achieve these common goals

833
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,559
recognize and applaud applaud um your

834
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,679
country's proactive active advocacy

835
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,120
in doing your part in protecting your

836
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,039
part your population from covid because

837
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,559
we think covid

838
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,240
is a special case of an asymmetric

839
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,080
uh vector

840
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,000
that shows certain critical

841
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,640
infrastructures are very very fragile

842
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,840
and the collective action can remediate

843
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,039
and assist

844
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,919
in solutions so collaboration again

845
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,720
threat threats are are common

846
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,679
remediations for shared knowledge uh

847
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,080
need to be generated to match those

848
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,159
but just to close threats in cyberspace

849
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,240
are not restricted by borders

850
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,360
now that's

851
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,799
centrally why cis is interested in

852
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,200
international collaboration but not only

853
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,120
the positives of the internet are often

854
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,760
lost in the rush to mitigate threats and

855
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,440
risks

856
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,320
after all cyberspace wasn't created at

857
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,880
least mostly wasn't created um so the

858
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,399
cyber security professionals like us

859
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,399
could have a good time pursuing risks

860
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:17,840
that are intellectually fascinating and

861
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,559
probably financially lucrative

862
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,960
it was created to allow the sharing or

863
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,880
at least exchange of information and

864
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,960
evolved into a repository of the

865
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,720
greatest collection of information

866
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,720
available for exchange in the history of

867
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,799
the human race

868
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,720
that's worth preserving it's also worth

869
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,640
preserving because it's probably the

870
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,799
most

871
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,039
the most global single platform for

872
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,320
economic exchange and advancement in

873
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,440
history

874
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,840
those are that's what's on the line when

875
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,559
when we seek to address risks and risk

876
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,360
management goals in cyberspace that's

877
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,480
why

878
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,919
we're so happy to collaborate with

879
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,640
countries like chile and others to

880
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,440
achieve those evidence

881
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,559
with that

882
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:03,919
happy to take questions and thank you

883
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:07,080
for listening

884
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,250
so

885
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:34,849
[Music]

886
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:46,080
[Music]

887
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,200
david

888
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,960
[Music]

889
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,279
yes i'm still here oh oh hi i couldn't

890
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,760
see ya i didn't have your

891
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,039
um

892
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,000
picture oh thank you so much it was very

893
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,039
very interesting um i have two questions

894
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,640
here

895
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,960
what's the best strategy for protecting

896
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,960
the critical infrastructure of a country

897
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,000
well that's a big question

898
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,440
i um take both questions every time if

899
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,080
you like and then just answer them okay

900
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,000
and so the other one is do you think

901
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,159
that the collaboration between the

902
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,960
private uh world or the public world is

903
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,600
fundamental

904
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,279
so yeah you can catch over the last one

905
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,600
yeah like it's it's a collaboration

906
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,440
between the the private sector and the

907
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,919
public sectors and the military for for

908
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,360
achieving

909
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,159
uh security

910
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,039
okay um yes to the last one i think that

911
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:46,000
because the private sector controls

912
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,679
the private sector drives technological

913
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,919
innovation included infrastructures both

914
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,840
in the infrastructures themselves and

915
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,240
the third party um i.t and ot

916
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,240
technologies that are implemented inside

917
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,399
critical infrastructures so if we don't

918
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,240
collaborate closely with

919
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,679
the private sector we won't actually

920
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,840
understand how critical infrastructures

921
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,720
operate so yes public private

922
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,480
collaboration is fundamental to critical

923
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,679
infrastructure

924
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,440
cyber security and defense

925
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,600
and there's no way around that and

926
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,039
if one doesn't collaborate one is

927
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,519
accepting risk created somewhere else

928
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,200
that one will then have to deal with

929
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,880
ultimately anyway so that would be the

930
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,399
answer to the second question

931
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,399
first question um you know different

932
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:25,840
countries have adopted different

933
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,559
strategies for critical infrastructure

934
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,320
defense and critical instructor cyber

935
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,399
security two separate things

936
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,720
um for critical infrastructure cyber

937
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,440
security and i'll sort of focus on that

938
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,640
um

939
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,159
first thing you need to do is understand

940
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:41,600
what's critical

941
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,039
and we have a whole debate in the united

942
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,399
states about whether all critical

943
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,399
infrastructure that are equally critical

944
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,519
and

945
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:48,960
there's a sort of strangeness to that

946
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,240
argument because

947
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,240
in a sense you're arguing about how to

948
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,440
argue

949
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,679
um you come up with a list of sometimes

950
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,519
arbitrary list of critical systems that

951
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,360
are necessary for the continuity of the

952
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,840
economy the continuity of government and

953
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,200
for the preservation of economic

954
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,240
advantage

955
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,080
however defined by a particular country

956
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,840
that's your list of priority areas that

957
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,520
need to be protected

958
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,679
then the question is who owns them

959
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,440
and what entities own them so you come

960
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,199
up with an entity list

961
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,159
for

962
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,839
for that which it describes sometimes

963
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,280
it's public agencies sometimes it's a

964
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,960
private sector so once you have your

965
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,480
critical asset list and you have your

966
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,560
entity list the question is what are the

967
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,079
interdependencies between asset owners

968
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,520
and entities

969
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,320
that

970
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,560
create areas of opportunity for

971
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,960
attackers it's the way we view it we

972
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,399
talk about things called national

973
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,079
critical functions

974
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,639
things like deliver electricity

975
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,359
deliver food and water deliver electric

976
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:46,000
power deliver transportation services

977
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,839
and we look at the entity list and the

978
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:50,800
act and the asset list for each of those

979
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,599
critical functions and we look at

980
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,719
vulnerability and exploitation potential

981
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,960
in each of those things

982
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,520
once we've done that that creates a list

983
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,760
of priority areas to protect

984
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,440
and you can score those mathematically

985
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,599
if you want i i am told like

986
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,280
quantitative metrics

987
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,119
so we look at history look at the risk

988
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,200
history of how people are victimized we

989
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,040
look at the vulnerabilities that aren't

990
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,640
patched or secured

991
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,480
and then we come up with a prioritized

992
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,680
schedule

993
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,680
of how to take action what kind of

994
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,440
action you need to take and whose

995
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,839
responsibility is to take it

996
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,400
that is the hardcore of any strategy now

997
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,359
there are strategies that prioritize

998
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,119
threat actors

999
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,680
um for us no secret our priority threat

1000
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,359
actors that we worry about are china

1001
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,920
russia iran north korea that would be

1002
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,000
different for chile

1003
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,920
but note how that intersects with the

1004
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,079
entity list and the asset list because

1005
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,920
the actors are exploiting either the

1006
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,760
entities or the assets in their

1007
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,599
interconnection

1008
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,240
so this is basically our method

1009
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,320
and those three actors get special

1010
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,960
attention from our intelligence services

1011
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,400
and they get special attention from our

1012
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,000
military as well

1013
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,839
um because we're concerned with securing

1014
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:07,520
critical infrastructure which

1015
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,040
provides services to the government and

1016
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,160
to the military among others so that's

1017
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,079
basically our approach there's longer

1018
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,079
ways of describing it but i'm trying to

1019
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,800
summarize um

1020
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,880
what the basics of a strategy are now

1021
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,160
the most important part of that strategy

1022
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,400
of course is execution

1023
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,480
you've got to have a

1024
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,440
consistent implementation plan for doing

1025
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,280
something about that prioritized list of

1026
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,720
entities and

1027
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,880
assets that need remediating

1028
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,400
and it's continuous it isn't something

1029
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,000
you do and then you come back five years

1030
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,880
later

1031
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,320
because there is a watch and warning

1032
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,800
part of this thing is permanent you need

1033
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,320
surveillance you need to instrument your

1034
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,839
critical infrastructures to make sure

1035
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,400
you know who's there how vulnerability

1036
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,400
they are whether your protections are

1037
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,839
working and you know most of this

1038
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:55,680
you know anybody on this on this webinar

1039
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,200
who's going to be connecting this early

1040
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,960
in the morning is going to

1041
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,320
know the techniques i'm talking about

1042
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,000
here but the notion of interim

1043
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,480
instrumentation dense instrumentation of

1044
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,000
networked assets

1045
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,640
is something that we're we're trying to

1046
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,160
foster in the united states but a lot of

1047
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,599
our critical instructors still aren't

1048
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,680
instrumented properly for the purposes

1049
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,680
of cyber security and warning they're

1050
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,119
instrumented for the purposes of their

1051
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,640
businesses but getting that

1052
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,800
instrumentation adapted or getting

1053
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,400
access to threat feeds

1054
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,480
that allow situational awareness on

1055
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,280
exploitation and risk patterns is what

1056
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,560
we're trying to encourage the most

1057
