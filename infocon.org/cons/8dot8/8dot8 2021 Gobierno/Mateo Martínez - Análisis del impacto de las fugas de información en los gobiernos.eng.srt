00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:59,340
to maintain hygiene  In the

17
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,260
virtual world in parallel, we are also going to

who is going to talk to us  analysis of the

50
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,280
impact of information leaks from

51
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,960
Latin American governments he is an expert

52

luckily decreasing a little in the number of

57
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:21,680
daily cases advancing that

58
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,629
vaccination so hopefully in a

59
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:25,579

update ourselves on

72
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,880
cybersecurity issues of the pandemic despite

73
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,100
being far away so extremely grateful

74
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,650

us thanked we are we mateos I leave you the

76
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,160
stage all this study talks to an

77
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,959
audience that is there are more than a thousand

78
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,670

connect and talk with them

81
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,920
So we leave the 8.8

82
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,780
government scenario specifically for you,

83
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,700
thank you very much and well thank you to

84
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,709

00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:25,630
impressive number of congratulations and

86
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,100
congratulations to all for being able to

87
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,290
dedicate this time to send us up to date

88
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,060
to talk to the community and that

89
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,800
doing turns  Despite the distance,

90
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,750
appreciate all this pandemic situation

91
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,569
that has taken us all away a bit so

92
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:39,310
good to thank you again and well

93
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,890
I hope this presentation is of interest

94
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,590
the idea is to look for a brief

95
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,530
analysis of what an hour allows us

96
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,720
of what they have been  the leaks of

97
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,520
information and attacks and how it is or

98
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,950
impacting can be impacting on the

99
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,570
different governments with which I am going to

100
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,350
do a brief tour

101
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,980
still

102
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:14,290
and well they

103
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:18,769
simply claim that the

104
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:21,110
world has presented and I go directly to the objective

105
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,180
of the action after the  a bit

106
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,760
of international context and among other

107
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,170
attacks that have occurred from studies

108
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,940
, information leakage and finally  We will

109
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,250
close you with some conclusions, an

110
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,710
analysis and a little about how

111
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,970
those techniques were, we are not going to do a

112
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,440
little bit in what is scraping

113
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,390
mainly more than anything in care

114
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,450
what was the attack and the massive

115
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,880
Facebook leak that was left to me.  The

116
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,300

00:06:08,249 --> 00:06:09,509
software development team which we have

154
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:11,849
worked on in cybersecurity patchwork

155
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:14,159

rci issues or without measure created with

158
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:22,949
us then we work with the

159
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:23,909
integration of open tools

160
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:26,969
where we have deployed several networks

161
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,279
of my regionals to share

162
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:31,050
tell you buy  omissions and in turn

163
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,490
integrating this with different

164
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,770
platforms such as ips is the

165
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,839
incident management tools or

166
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:40,439
sandbox of this manual and well within

167

a brief introduction minutes later

170
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:48,959
I thank you for the time we get in

171
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,310


172
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,070


173
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,620
I am going to

174
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,950
go through some of the incidents

175
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,090
looting information leaks that have

176
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:02,060
happened, it is impossible today in this

177
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,190
event not to talk about this last issue of

178
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,770
colonial pipeline 9  Where there has been an

179
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,860
attack, it is very important that it paralyzed

180
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,950
operations in products, but that is

181
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:16,190
the east coast of the United States.

182
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,860


183
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,110


184
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,630


185
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,640


186
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,350
do to protect them and

187
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,330
work on them and the impact it

188
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,260
can generate,

189
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,520
as the

190
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:38,450
washington post commented as fu  e the impact at

191
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,600
the regional and good level of the volume in

192
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,390
turn that has this 45 percent from

193
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:47,090
the consumption of the east coast compromised

194
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:50,000
well with other paralyzed headquarters led

195
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,580
behind that a wave of panic where

196
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,690
it was also consumed in

197
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,240
the stops that were exhausted  They had a good

198
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,940
idea, but the concept of video transmits more than anything

199
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:04,280
a bit of this malware operation as

200
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:12,060
such, it can really analyze

201
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,250
to have a specific, clear objective,

202
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,230
with which

203
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,540
that dedication of that

204
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,130
professionalism in the sense of

205
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,230
attacks speaks to us and it may happen again.  through

206
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:27,020
this process but what hacking leads to

207
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,340
where in the stage of

208
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,020
very strong recognition of the

209
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,020
undertaking of the target and apart from there

210
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:36,510
saying the execution of the operation

211
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,880
well, a lot is said about the darkside

212
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,200
as part of it

213
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,020
the origin of this blood attack

214
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,340
sometimes  see that there are all very anxious

215
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,550
to other acquaintances who have also passed

216
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:51,640
in the regional market with which this

217
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,100
should generate regional alerts  There are no

218
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,260
alerts in Latin America of the types of

219
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,870
attacks that come in handy, it works with

220
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,370
this affiliate model,

221
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:04,180
we also know one and in turn, and well, this double

222
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,430
distortion of the market since the malware

223
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,930
has evolved from time to time

224
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,390
since our screen will start to cost

225
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,200
stealing information.  at the time

226
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,810
of the ranch because it has transformed this

227
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,500
great business of criminal scammers

228
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,240
now this is modeled extortion

229
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,570
on the one hand is the encryption of data the

230
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,300
kidnapping of data and in turn the threat

231
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,430
with the leakage and the exposure of

232
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,760
that data

233
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,860
then we have the  concept that I go out to

234
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,140
work the audience and warn of the

235
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,120
types of attacks that are coming in how

236
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,910
we should face and face this

237
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,340
type of been raising

238
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,600
the price is that this is simply

239
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,060
the timeline of the

240
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,480
I followed them in May where they closed these 100

241
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,600
in gigabytes of  information either in

242
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,820
turn with the locks by ransomware or

243
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,880
requesting payments and from there as a

244
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,240
refund  It is how they appear

245
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,279
involved in the scene good for good to

246
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,459
achieve and lost badly May 9 that is on

247
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:12,889
May 12 March 13 when it returns to

248
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:14,400
operations

249
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:19,550
what is the operation appears the

250
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:24,060
attack begins in the following days they take

251
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,590
the limit of one  statement not where they

252
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,940
are investigating the company was hired

253
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,520
disappointed to work the

254
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,840
new May joins the

255
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,050
national administration

256
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:37,870
of creation the investigation security agency

257
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,970
well they are working to

258
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,070
finish a little this that dark side

259
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:46,250
was the rounds humor behind list with

260
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,680
saber of  the operation in between

261
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,860
our politicians not threatening

262
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,570
different states as responsible for

263
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,410
what happened

264
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,649
well that returns to the operation

265
00:10:56,649 --> 00:10:59,740
between May 12 and 13 on the return

266
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,079
to humanity it

267
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:04,869
scrabbled the two communications that

268
00:11:04,869 --> 00:11:07,269
the colony manages in the pipeline about what

269
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:09,610
happened and  little commenting and communicating

270
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,800
a little the occasions and the estimate of

271
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,689
the recovery and well on Wednesday the

272
00:11:15,689 --> 00:11:18,220
12th it has a little where i  The

273
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,499
operations begin at the end of the day

274
00:11:20,499 --> 00:11:25,149
and well for that, also responding to

275
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:27,639
that panic that I mentioned about

276
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:29,710
massive purchases, not

277
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,080
the states to compensate for that

278
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,750
lack of distribution and, well, starting

279
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,580
with the operation and I return to taking

280
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:40,490
days to return to a  humanity

281
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:44,370
and very aligned to this and

282
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,190
not so far ago in February

283
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,709
the report was also published by CISA with

284
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,350
the attack on

285
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,270
a non-natural gas plant for

286
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,340
natural gas compression that also caused by

287
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,040
a ransomware issue well issues of

288
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,950
closure of  installation operations

289
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:03,080
well and there the shisha communicates precisely

290
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,560
this issue of his importance to

291
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,840
protect the operational systems the

292
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,200
criticisms and the ume that they raised almost a

293
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,980
year ago in that increase in capacity and

294
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,160
activities anniversaries

295
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,720
in these future issues the criticisms

296
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,550
and good there  We can go backwards and

297
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:25,310
I think I want to quickly move on again

298
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,959
in the cases of bowels it has also been

299
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,689
simple mentioned and it is always  to the

300
00:12:29,689 --> 00:12:31,339
situation that the great difference

301
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:34,449
between

302
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:37,029
cybernetic environments verses

303
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:40,070
traditional wars where there are no clear rules

304
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:42,860
in the protected entities

305
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,750
critical structures always

306
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,110
schools hospitals and felipe sometimes

307
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,720
when those who are directed and are not

308
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,660
more authorized these laws of war do not

309
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,150
apply and these  areas are

310
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,670
sensitive they become detectable

311
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,350
vacancies it is a crisis that

312
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:03,020
is finally attacking and there has already been a difference

313
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,000
between countries in terms of measuring

314
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,010
the capacity of forces there are sites like

315
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,420
global firepower that allow us to

316
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,450
identify and compare the power between

317
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,880
countries understands

318
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,630


319
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,880


320
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,530


321
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,600
If it is possible to have a reference in cybersecurity, if it is possible to have a

322
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,910
reference in cybersecurity, it is very

323
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,310
different either between countries but at the same

324
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,630
time they begin to see actors that are not

325
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,310
countries with what  which is more difficult to ignore

326
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,410
these measurements and when this im  pact

327
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,740
lets pipes develop critical and

328
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,750
begin to trigger problems

329
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,970
in turn throughout the supply chain

330
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,639
a second case of was information already a

331
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:45,259
little closer that is the central issue

332
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:47,839
today is the case of erasure and c's

333
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,440


334
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,970
has also been done  Known in the region, a

335
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:53,790
case in Argentina where

336
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,610
sensitive data from the

337
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,850
federal police has been exposed is exposing data on the situation

338
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:03,300
of undercover agents, not today

339
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,070
in the case of drug trafficking, rather than

340
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,670
generating these types of problems at the level of

341
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:11,040
their personal lives of these people, well

342
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,589
this had  your site sites that on the

343
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:16,290
outside but we know that the internet is an

344
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,779
illusion to attend then the stand or

345
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:20,430
simply sites like boat instructor you

346
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,950
can see a little in the activity on the

347
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,380
site and it is good you can access the

348
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,320
links in ondjiva where that

349
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,480
information is still  alive and turning

350
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,860
in turn

351
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:36,590
being the case the Argentine part in

352
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,690
particular good growth in

353
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:41,360
what is financial fraud

354
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,970
posing as a  r the

355
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,650
bank staff well making very direct calls,

356
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:48,220
knowing the

357
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,780
personal data of the target person and the

358
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,010
month all this has seen

359
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,410
very large increases and many times

360
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,900
also abusing and taking data precisely this

361
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,930
leak of information where it allows the

362
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,760
attacker to have  a criminal I have a

363
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,950
complete profile of the person up to

364
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,810
their family nucleus personal information

365
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,700
with which it is very easy to validate and

366
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,000
impersonate the bank and finally

367
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,860
ask for actions such as password change

368
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,870
request a token etc.

369
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:17,150
names complete account numbers

370
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,370
data validation  personal data

371
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,360
for which two attackers achieve a

372
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,430
growth from certain data

373
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,980
that they have

374
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,630
but a year

375
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,620
or several

376
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,520
and two leaks information from large

377
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,140
electronic companies of new cases in the

378
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,930
meantime case of facebook well that has

379
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,880
been covered in the austral present

380
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,820
we see here two covers  new cnn and

381
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,250
vice, speaking precisely of these

382
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,280
millions of data plays  two and that it exposes in

383
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,620
front of the users more to them the

384
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,850
damages can arrive in these

385
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,940
companies due to lawsuits due to lawsuits or

386
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,350
due to non-compliance with a type of

387
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,840
regulation in impacts since real are

388
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,190
people's data we do not always

389
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,650
talk about that the sufficient value is

390
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,990
the  data that people provide in

391
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,380
these two types of each form

392
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,660
and before they went directly to analyze

393
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,700
a little more facebook in particular

394
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,680
wanted to comment a little of our

cases did not fail and astrazeneca

'microsoft twitter bío channel several

397
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,130
attacks that have been happening in

398
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,320
recent times and  that it is impossible not to

399
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,540
talk about it but hey if you want to

400
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,520
enter a little bit on facebook and

401

observing the point of what is the

impact of the government more shake that is

403
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,130
ours our focus today in our

404
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,850
center of another topic of the day

405
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,860
we talk about more than 500 million

406
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,870
of Facebook users with a lot of

407
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:41,590
personal information that leaks and

408
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:44,889
of those 500 million users

409
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:47,170
and of Facebook that has many digits

410
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:50,559
2002 11 million collected 6 million in

411
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:52,449
India and well compact is in

412
00:16:52,449 --> 00:16:54,010
Latin America

413
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,230
is all good begins to see information

414
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,339
of what is leaking

415
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:02,180
comes out with this along to the

416
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,910
bridge standard publishing data and he

417
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:09,940
good morning in April and others where

418
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,960
information

419
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,470
and the  user information

420
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,280
is definitely discovered that this

421
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,790
actually comes from clicks 2009 2019

422
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:24,599
2020 actually more than a lic not more

423
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,329
than a hack using kraft tapeworms

424
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:29,460
social networks have been denouncing

425
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,940
that

426
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,730
good weather has been blocking this game of

427
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:37,850
that trying  That this tortilla is not

428
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,080
exposing the phone number

429
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,419
exposing personal information but

430
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:44,330
well that data has been remaining and

431
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,559
these scraping techniques that

432
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:48,649
basically is simulating real responses

433
00:17:48,649 --> 00:17:50,690
to passion and being able to bring information

434
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,120
without any type of

435
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,799
activity since it had a prominent

436
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:58,710
dictionary of a criminal nature

437
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:02,340
so to speak there is a dilemma in the

438
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,160
discussion about certain data that are

439
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,570
anti  Guos are from the visionary of the

440
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:10,620
beginning of 2020 that is really risky

441
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,210
finally but the reality that there is

442
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,160
data that does not change the

443
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,080
person's name does not change obviously and one on the

444
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,660
phone is few who are

445
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:22,410
rotating,

446
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:25,290
the work persists the university of a study

447
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,800
the situation

448
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,039
[  Music]

449
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:31,940
humanitarian or loving well done

450
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,950
birth cities birth cities there are several

451
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,409
others that continue to last and we have

452
00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:38,989
seen that there are several so that it is

453
00:18:38,989 --> 00:18:40,700
a base that is that to have a year

454
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,229
two years and its

455
00:18:42,229 --> 00:18:44,330
corresponding degradation are

456
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:47,239
surely valid data and that is going well

457
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:49,200
to be difficult

458
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,059
that it will not be used for

459
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:54,770
criminal activities at some point in

460
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,170
time what is the

461
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,120
facebook link what type of data

462
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,340
phone number the identity generated from

463
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,390
facebook that we are allowed to

464
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,410
disappear with some other

465
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,050
özil platforms the name the

466
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:10,220
surname  sex marital status the

467
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,980
city work the study you have and

468
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,170
email in some cases n  or

469
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,310
in all cases they have this

470
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,350
information but number three 100

471
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,240
percent of the cases you have part of the

472
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,220
initiator who appears was information

473
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,530
then that allows

474
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,860
direct contact with the person because we are going to talk

475
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,410
a little about the numbers and Latin America

476
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:34,830
is impossible not  talk about the

477
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:37,380
largest countries with more population such as Brazil and

478
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,870
Mexico where good for that matter to say

479
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,970
8 million records will be played for the

480
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,190
chosen case around the 13

481
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:47,340
million records played with which this is

482
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,960
very large positions not from the

483
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,550
100 population  and very large numbers of

484
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:56,480
complete data and in users

485
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,160
if we go a little bit to what is

486
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,270
Argentina and Bolivia then two

487
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:05,360
million soon Argentina almost

488
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,179
three million in Bolivia well

489
00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:10,970
data also on Facebook from if we go

490
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:12,710
monitor data

491
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:17,059
from Colombia from Panama well let's go  to see

492
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:19,559
a little data

493
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:22,529
played also quite important that

494
00:20:22,529 --> 00:20:23,340
is not the case

495
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,340
byron of investment in 1,500,000 is a

496
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,919
country of three thousand  Lones of inhabitants in

497
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:32,190
the case of Guatemala and the medium also

498
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,110
of leaked data are really

499
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,629
very high numbers in percentage of the population

500
00:20:36,629 --> 00:20:38,789
that what is judged that we can clean the

501
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:41,639
base not after facebook with three

502
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:42,659
false

503
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:44,909
sergio there is no good but but they

504
00:20:44,909 --> 00:20:47,820
are  less really that number of data

505
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,200
that are not various and that it could be

506
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,789
that

507
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:59,239
Ecuador and Colombian Chile had not arrived

508
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:03,200
for the case of Chile and him

509
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,019
6 million 800 thousand approximately of

510
00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:07,880
records played application or also

511
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,880
close numbers 18 million

512
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,960
records games only manage mind

513
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,210
too  very shocking then good

514
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,799
that there is in there or that there is a type of

515
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:17,870
data and that how it impacts the government

516
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,789
how it affects the gene are

517
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:22,100
Facebook partners true not well a priori one

518
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,080
could say it does not affect me as the government

519
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,330
should not be affected from behind with

520
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,340
those  double click on this if we go to the

521
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,330
data played

522
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,990
from Chile in particular they share the

523
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:36,899
analysis the source of this given the leak

524
00:21:36,899 --> 00:21:40,710
from facebook well yes  and made public and

525
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,870
then very simple command

526
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:46,470
a double to count the girls well and

527
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:50,760
simply sharing the files in

528
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,850
the base of Chile

529
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,080
then here begins a little the

530
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,070
different topics analyzed

531
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,660
filters by

532
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:04,010
email cl 2006 defense point

533
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:07,130
brushes two government accounts three

534
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:11,560
accounts in  1012 l

535
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,090
we look for a filter in some filters

536
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:18,650
simply looking very ask a google

537
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:20,750
will not be good defense

538
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,600
entities government entities never classified

539
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,980
by armies in the database three

540
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,370
thousand 900 people well that in their facebook

541
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:33,500
mentioned in exercise either by

542
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,650
studies for their  role in the army but they

543
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:39,350
are numerous large and there are few

544
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:42,230
attacks today and we have already seen this in

545
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,700
operations in different countries of the

546
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,090
region that are calling by phone and

547
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:49,340
in information with which we have to do

548
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,140
a work of education awareness.

549
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,910
to be careful now

550
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:55,430
with this call to the phone of no

551
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,400
strangers and with this type of

552
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,140
peti  tions are good but good being with

553
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:03,500
the numbers 233 that appear with an

554
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,410
attention to the air force and 31 explicit

555
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:09,140
with what is the ministry of defense of 9

556
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,360
as a joint staff,

557
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,090
with which analysis filters are started

558
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,410
on this database that

559
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:17,660
only  text which allows this

560
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,240
type of filters to be made and that begins to be

561
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,540
exposed to more sensitive

562
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,309
and more specific point data and directed to what

563
00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:27,620
may be a government area.This is

564
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,720
an example of what can come out with

565
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,140
these filters the separation with the

566
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,290
colon but city not army of chile

567
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:38,600
well before this was the

568
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,700
full name of the person the

569
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,990
facebook phone with which the offender and

570
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,540
the locations are directed to go to

571
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,130
the social network befriend the

572
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,650
person know the context not only

573
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:54,770
if  is married or single good some

574
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,800
other type of relationship but

575
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,320
also to understand friends can

576
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,300
be completely outlined

577
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,460
from open data and between her with many  I have

578
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:06,740
already said information in the

579
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,480
city, which is the money, we are

580
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,830
seeing this type of operation in the

581
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,860
region, which is why it is important now to

582
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,360
work on awareness and

583
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,590
education, they have to transmit this type of

584
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:20,000
event, both information

585
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,790
and spa  attacks that happen after the

586
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:25,910
good other example simply with the

587
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:27,920
example of joint staff

588
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,890
when trying to simulate a little

589
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:33,530
that there is a small attacker not with a

590
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,540
quick and manual analysis say good

591
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,720
search in virginia in google search in and

592
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,350
ask and search  A couple of organizations,

593
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,300
although they belong to, having

594
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,160
the defense sector first and then you can do

595
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,300
the same with

596
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:52,230
issues of organizing it is the government or

597
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:55,260
parastatals they have delays we did the

598
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,050
search for state companies in Chile

599
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:00,540
simply not a validation source

600
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:04,390
simply looking in multimedia

601
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:10,210
and 223  records with bank status as

602
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:14,110
information 57 with mint at 103

603
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:17,200
as well as without potential  nte

604
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,760
could be the

605
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,290
metallurgy mining research center but it could do

606
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,550
something different, it may well have its

607
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:25,060
margin of error as well, but with what it

608
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,160
is for copper positions and thus, good

609
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,480
searches can be made for each

610
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,930
of these companies,

611
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,040
commands that act as a filter, it could be

612
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,510
programmed  and automate and make a

613
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:39,030
search portal or automate against

614
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,100
these lists but hey they begin to

615
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,370
appear

616
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:45,760
and numbers are also important and that

617
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,660
this type of abuse is also expected

618
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,770
with these platforms with which it is to

619
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:53,680
be attentive to communicate treatments about

620
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,860
these places then not only the

621
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:59,890
Central government is not only areas

622
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,750
of defense but all that is

623
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,100


624
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,280
also snow providers are going to be or

625
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,690
we hope they are part of these

626
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,549
attacks so

627
00:26:09,549 --> 00:26:12,530
that prevention work is also important,

628
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:15,500
well on the basis analyzed is a little

629
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,710
the summary of files and  he

630
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,450
plain text files with this

631
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:23,270
separation fine with very simple commands and searches

632
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:26,240
fine

633
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,370
Where to do the count with vines

634
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:31,640
with cat to analyze it and clean it with the

635
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,800
string that we want well and well,

636
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,390
the text filters are done and that you can

637
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,250
find that they are the counts, which is a

638
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,720
bit of

639
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,250
the analysis that followed to have those

640
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,960
numbers a  which was being

641
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:47,929
presented and that here the summary of the

642
00:26:47,929 --> 00:26:52,700
totals by country well and in turn of

643
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,020
some of the investigations is

644
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,000
clearly for the case of the Chilean government

645
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,409
that identify the

646
00:26:57,409 --> 00:26:59,240
reference numbers and in which they can also be

647
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,880
interesting after being buried in one and

648
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,549
Later, in the raw data of the

649
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:06,440
analysis, I can also share with you without a

650
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,380
problem and make it sectorized for what

651
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,260
it is and the records played by

652
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,419
type of sector,

653
00:27:14,419 --> 00:27:16,080
now

654
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,450
then the visible part said it to

655
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:20,999
finish closing the idea.

656
00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:23,009
These Facebook cases left

657
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:25,039
information for  that you use

658
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:29,420
targeted campaigns in scams

659
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:32,000
really scams today online to look for

660
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,730
access to bank accounts and there are many

661
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:37,100
scams that were already coming  Seeing now

662
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:40,570
enriched with these

663
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:45,700
massive and very complete databases, LinkedIn is mentioned

664
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,309
very quickly, obviously,

665
00:27:47,309 --> 00:27:50,320
with less amount of data played from

666
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,020
the region

667
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,240
but with much more information and success

668
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,730
to also unite that information and

669
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,850
to take advantage today also of  That without

670
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:02,289
good and open sources that can

671
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:04,690
feed these databases or public data

672
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:06,789
from governments, many are in many

673
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:08,470
government portals in Latin American countries,

674
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:10,750
simply by knowing the

675
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,010
entity cell or the

676
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:13,779
national identity document, one can make

677
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:15,460
information about the person then they

678
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,580
also begin  What to do is, even if it is

679
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,020
more growth from the phone and

680
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,410
leidi

681
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,060
hire to try to get the

682
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,070
document and from there to look for more

683
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,900
information you start them in a chain

684
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,840
of enrichment of this data that

685
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,040
begins to speak dangerous in the face of

686
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,210
these campaigns and in the face of

687
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,390
people can detect them in the

688
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,340
call the bank is rolling

689
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,280
personal data  Sometimes it is something common and that

690
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,930
is repeated in two different countries, well it

691
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:45,370
begins to be a little more worrying

692
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,870
about these data

693
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:51,860
because several still in the base that is

694
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,530
degrading 2019 define the

695
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:58,250
visitors in that 20% and

696
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,500
also register some false value some profile

697
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,990
false, although a professional can also add up

698
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:05,930
but it will also be less than

699
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:09,370
10% and 10% of data on average

700
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,420
directly linked to the

701
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,760
defense goyano seeing this from the general base

702
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,110
which is important in the information

703
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:20,420
that has leaked in terms of the

704
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,280
detection of  personnel who work today in

705
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,440
local defense government are well in

706
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,330
this educational process also sometimes

707
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:27,710
more in the field of defense that they also

708
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:30,050
publish that type of information with

709
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,970
which other weapons should be fired, they

710
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,790
should work a certain type of

711
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,990
treatment in it

712
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,700
to vary this  Obviously the

713
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,210
bases are played on the internet but in turn

714
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:43,010
the garden pound site that

715
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:45,500
we all know was added was also,

716
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,750
therefore, it could not be  ede put your phone

717
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,610
and checking against the complete base

718
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:51,860
well to know if your phone is

719
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,780
inside the disk

720
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,890
the easiest way to validate I do not know

721
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,929
against the phone not only the name

722
00:29:56,929 --> 00:29:59,230
because it is a type d

723
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,630
change the format but the phone

724
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:03,880
ends up being an indicator  unique on the

725
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,000
platform

726
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,620
and then good positive aspects

727
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,410
only for sure offender but

728
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,330
for your marketing company more free

729
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:14,910
today a database the market and

730
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:17,640
cars on the go with first name last name

731
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,160
phone and charge is at three

732
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,080
dollars and it averaged well then

733
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,240
we talk about numbers  Very large today must

734
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,670
of database sales with this

735
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:29,400
information is segmented with some

736
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,840
type of filter like the ones I showed them

737
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,900
but that already gives it a value and that is

738
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,910
when wealth is still lucky to

739
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,560
assume a good value it

740
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,360
generated a whole black market  on the

741
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,040
way and sometimes to the market that

742
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:44,130
uses this for other tasks and good

743
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:45,990
enrichment marketing topics and

744
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:47,580
obviously there is a topic that I know  I would

745
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,220
try more than anything in a few minutes

746
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,870
but time is the subject of investigations

747
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,820
using without and obviously these

748
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,490
leaks are valid information for your

749
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:57,750
store after seeing and doing countries

750
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,520
because this but facing the

751
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,960
investigative process is something that can help

752
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,490
well  At least for

753
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:05,810
one more place of consultation

754
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:08,480
and what can end up solving some

755
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,700
of the cases in then part is the

756
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,890
work of patrolling if the crime

757
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:15,680
that can be fed from this

758
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,730
database plays and become something

759
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:24,010
positive of the good after good

760
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:29,350
There is a whole non-social situation

761
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,390
in Colombia that has also been seen in

762
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,539
the press and well

763
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:35,429
there was a whole series of attacks on

764
00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:40,259
different websites on

765
00:31:40,259 --> 00:31:43,289
government platforms that also managed to filter

766
00:31:43,289 --> 00:31:46,499
data and in particular mail data from

767
00:31:46,499 --> 00:31:48,720
the national army, in addition to Colombia '

768
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,119
different and in the armed forces with

769
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,950
which they begin to be inaugurated even

770
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:55,379
more worrying who in turn

771
00:31:55,379 --> 00:31:58,289
beyond these leaks ta  n massive all the

772
00:31:58,289 --> 00:32:00,269
leaks that happen continuously in the

773
00:32:00,269 --> 00:32:02,279
different areas of the defense government

774
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:04,710
in the region also feed these

775
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,330
same problems and this type of targeted attacks,

776
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:09,629
then well part of this

777
00:32:09,629 --> 00:32:11,789
work the work of processes inc has

778
00:32:11,789 --> 00:32:13,799
teeth and sources it would be good to

779
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:16,229
incorporate sources  Well played for

780
00:32:16,229 --> 00:32:18,299
investigations for good like staining

781
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:21,179
index buds have them and

782
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:24,479
work policy well of what yes within

783
00:32:24,479 --> 00:32:27,009
its three types no and this is something

784
00:32:27,009 --> 00:32:29,599
analysis of I wanted to simply leave it

785
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:32,839
some tools to do that

786
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:35,629
zinc process where we are going to see and go  that

787
00:32:35,629 --> 00:32:37,460
some of these data are the

788
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,830
real name of the user on facebook that we believe

789
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,839
in and mediators we do not have our

790
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:43,909
techniques only with the basis of facebook

791
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:46,009
we would be covering at least

792
00:32:46,009 --> 00:32:48,499
four of these eight places the network

793
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:50,690
that we also have education in  him and

794
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:53,029
well but you can calculate the access link

795
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:53,899


796
00:32:53,899 --> 00:32:56,089
that would also be missing but hey there is a

797
00:32:56,089 --> 00:32:58,219
lot of data  and we would add

798
00:32:58,219 --> 00:33:01,400
personal data such as the phone well

799
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,780
and good in city professional career issues

800
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,420
we really get

801
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:08,030
into this a lot only with this data that

802
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,140
we

803
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,330
have I also leave you some lists of

804
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,300
very interesting tools also

805
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:17,660
to work on issues and our

806
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:20,690
social networks search for users in  sites

807
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:23,860
like eminem checkers who afterwards

808
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:27,440
searches for 25 sites like you because

809
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,210
today they are very helpful in the immediate vicinity,

810
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:31,850
but also other portals that

811
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:33,250
will help in this type of research

812
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:36,980
and good tools today from the market

813
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,690
also accompany this work of

814
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,670
recognition research there

815
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:43,370
Joan Foc, a lover of

816
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:45,080
tools, appears today leaving this little to be

817
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,940
able to work on different aspects

818
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,310
without so much technical as more

819
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:52,100
research and then well on the map

820
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,520
the same for the first context

821
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,250
but hey all this introduction that

822
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,610
took me or more what I wanted

823
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:03,429
was  to understand what happened

824
00:34:03,429 --> 00:34:06,670
behind attacks on  facebook how

825
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,710
this was done conventions crafting

826
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:11,290
as a concept that is familiar but

827
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:12,879
surely not so familiar to

828
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,770
everyone so I wanted to spend the

829
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:18,040
minutes to understand the technique to have the

830
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,570
easy tool and the problem

831
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:21,550
that portals in general have today

832
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:25,149
to protect themselves  patients thanks to

833
00:34:25,149 --> 00:34:26,830
ecommerce portals and they are

834
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:28,030
stealing prices and it is even used for

835
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:30,639
competition to always be one dollar

836
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,230
down with the market price of

837
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:34,659
trends that has had and supervised

838
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:36,190
not in different types of technologies

839
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:39,100
well there are many specialists today in

840
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,889
this  type of techniques but a

841
00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:43,929
tool and in a framework people

842
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:47,440
capi well developed in python well

843
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,080
that allows to automate and

844
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,659
make this development of

845
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:54,850
the crow links egg the spy

846
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:56,109
well as we want to call it is that they

847
00:34:56,109 --> 00:34:58,150
go to the websites go to  search for

848
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:00,220
information and this listener includes when

849
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,880
we say site when I say web sites

850
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,369
on the net so  cial will go to twitter facebook

851
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:08,670
and bring that information as if we were

852
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:12,269
an authenticated user and real good but

853
00:35:12,269 --> 00:35:14,160
have these votes to automate the

854
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,769
escape installation and think escape and

855
00:35:16,769 --> 00:35:20,789
what operating in to be able to use it but

856
00:35:20,789 --> 00:35:22,859
you can also download from web success

857
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:27,180
and build packages in  but good in an

858
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,549
open way very easy to use well

859
00:35:29,549 --> 00:35:32,339
documented well to extend it

860
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:34,380
work very quickly multiple

861
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,630
examples well it allows to develop

862
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,450
small miners that are working

863
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:42,000
for us well and to work and order the

864
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,160
whole issue of the spiders that are

865
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,190
working to search for information

866
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,829
analysis

867
00:35:48,829 --> 00:35:50,900
and well this  Interactive station that

868
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,609
has a price so that they are tests and

869
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:55,069
variations allows to do crowley in

870
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,469
different interesting formats html

871
00:35:57,469 --> 00:35:59,809
xml it is seen in a way to save

872
00:35:59,809 --> 00:36:01,880
authorities also in 611 to be able to

873
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,059
reuse them in different platforms

874
00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:07,489
well it allows us to process the data well

875
00:36:07,489 --> 00:36:08,779
before finalizing the a  turn

876
00:36:08,779 --> 00:36:11,959
download images well integrate  with the

877
00:36:11,959 --> 00:36:14,569
next engine with anonymous prostheses or the

878
00:36:14,569 --> 00:36:16,999
proxy that is more wearable who defines

879
00:36:16,999 --> 00:36:18,709
the concurrence that we believe in the

880
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:21,410
information and in turn well filtered of

881
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:23,839
urls that we do not want to create so as not to create

882
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:26,359
more consumption more data that we do not need

883
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:27,920
in four good terms because it is also very

884
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,539
flexible work with these eight steps not

885
00:36:32,539 --> 00:36:35,869
where this really

886
00:36:35,869 --> 00:36:38,180
let us do it remember it is in the beijing of

887
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,609
the different fighters well working

888
00:36:40,609 --> 00:36:42,950
with those answers continuously already

889
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,720
thinking about the answers we have

890
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,809
and in turn working sending the is ours

891
00:36:47,809 --> 00:36:50,180
in if you want it to last for  send everything

892
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,960
in our country and from there we can

893
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,579
expand enrich the platform

894
00:36:55,579 --> 00:36:57,319
infiltrating and processing the data

895
00:36:57,319 --> 00:37:00,230
well in a simple way and behind this

896
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:02,749
spider concept if they have a

897
00:37:02,749 --> 00:37:05,240
dot org website left but at the same time there is an

898
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,369
executive that world

899
00:37:07,369 --> 00:37:08,930
flip the  view to relate

900
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:12,109
scapín test there pose as they see a

901
00:37:12,109 --> 00:37:14,900
little of the cardinal capitals capi well

902
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,289
we can there in general  r this little

903
00:37:18,289 --> 00:37:20,660
writing where we import is free,

904
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:23,329
well we define the class and

905
00:37:23,329 --> 00:37:26,539
we simply put the url with the name of spider and

906
00:37:26,539 --> 00:37:28,630
we launch

907
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,760
the type of quest and the type of

908
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,720
information that we want to get

909
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,430
important because it is to cut within the

910
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:36,600
html what type of tablets then

911
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:41,790
we are in  In this case the types appear

912
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:47,710
is what we want as the

913
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,150
name of the person is called as the

914
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,740
telephone number of the person is called as it is called

915
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:53,820
right at the price of the product

916
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:56,080
simply recognizing that type of

917
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,390
information they

918
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,940
happen to be here and do after

919
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,530
automatism to  bring that information

920
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:04,590
earth it would be really simple in

921
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,450
the congress 90 super powerful for that

922
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:10,980
work I do tell you posters in

923
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,290
scraping the hub for wanting to play it

924
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:16,050
can be a free account well so

925
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,360
demonstrate and there is a platform

926
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,960
to seek to practice a little in  this

927
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,780
game project 200 credits so they

928
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:28,230
can play a little bit be there where

929
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:31,730
today they can be the skin islet and you have

930
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:33,930
fu  Working well if you do not want to do it

931
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:36,030
on your local machine in and you can go through

932
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,640
these books and thus be able to practice the

933
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,220
graphics of the title of the information of

934
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,870
the description etc.

935
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:45,000


936
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,070


937
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:50,730
identify that such

938
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,630
that we need

939
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,910
if sometimes we do not recognize ourselves

940
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:58,150
quickly by seeing the html organizing

941
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:00,010
the page there are some tools for

942
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,420
example in export

943
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,670
albert is the extension for chrome well

944
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:06,160
that allows us just a more

945
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,200
graphic point in with friendly themes to be able to

946
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,140
understand what is the  We

947
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,910
need space well to be able to analyze and

948
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,950
know this with which afterwards we

949
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:17,170
can do that import of the selector

950
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:21,780
and from there define simply is

951
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,870
the example of facebook for example the

952
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:27,970
green below seems not the berlin timeline

953
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:30,390
well that what I want it to bring me

954
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:32,170
finally  It is free

955
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:34,270
and with space it is quite simple so

956
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:36,010
if I leave it as a tool to

957
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:38,530
understand a point m  as well as

958
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:40,900
doing this technique within what

959
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,170
is scrap

960
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,380
there is also one more example with the

961
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,910
cover neem, the alternative name

962
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:49,029


963
00:39:49,029 --> 00:39:52,390
etc. nine o'clock well, the other

964
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,489
types of places appear where it corresponds and to

965
00:39:54,489 --> 00:39:56,650
look for information and be attentive and it is

966
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:57,729
part of  this work of cyber

967
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:59,819
patrolling and the one that governments today

968
00:39:59,819 --> 00:40:03,359
believe that among countries we are

969
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,999
working to improve and take advantage of

970
00:40:06,999 --> 00:40:09,279
these social networks to prevent

971
00:40:09,279 --> 00:40:12,369
incidents, social unrest, attacks,

972
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:14,279
cyberattacks and extinction, all critical

973
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:17,259
with which the move is a  A place

974
00:40:17,259 --> 00:40:19,869
that also remains to be analyzed to

975
00:40:19,869 --> 00:40:21,699
put in some scanners begins to appear

976
00:40:21,699 --> 00:40:23,679
today in the future, you have to be

977
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:27,159
attentive in the classifiers to

978
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:29,619
the forums and people who make the type

979
00:40:29,619 --> 00:40:31,150
of comment this type of publication

980
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:33,099
well to be able to be aware because it

981
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:36,239
is a lot  more difficult than it can be

982
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:40,059
open but hey my scale appeared

983
00:40:40,059 --> 00:40:42,109
as a tool that you can

984
00:40:42,109 --> 00:40:44,569
use to take advantage of and  ner the great

985
00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:46,700
sector for that search after

986
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,050
other interesting tools

987
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:51,630
this social but well that allows

988
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:54,300
basically from an image and to

989
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,190
search the social networks and decided a

990
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:58,470
good score on the similarity between the

991
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:00,570
photos and the profile in social networks

992
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:02,660
which  Also something of great value today

993
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:05,040
in research, especially the

994
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:09,380
monitoring of some more tools

995
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,270
that have been very useful in case of

996
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,400
need to visualize the crp in

997
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,770
scenarios,

998
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:19,440
you can also make a

999
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,350
free account well and be able to do with those

1000
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:26,940
links how to accelerate the  50 and

1001
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,300
correlation, this

1002
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,400
isolation tool allows us to do exactly

1003
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,770
what the story is like in how this is going in

1004
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:37,170
the mail.

1005
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:39,420


1006
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,640


1007
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,580


1008
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,660
interesting tool

1009
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,910
and analyzing this evolution over time

1010
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:50,520
well through the different

1011
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,830
platforms

1012
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:54,140
tools such as tweet  more also that

1013
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:57,200
we are soaked in heat in this twitter

1014
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,390
of those networks to be continuously

1015
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:01,820
chanting nothing well to make

1016
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:05,030
projections of between 2 and

1017
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:07,880
early warnings when situations happen that

1018
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,850
can affect society to the entire

1019
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:14,750
community and good events now go for

1020
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:17,660
example from  the capitol where although

1021
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,850
the server and pregnant women on their way, good

1022
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:22,310
in general, transits speaking

1023
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:24,740
social networks, someone does not have to be

1024
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:27,980
seeing portals as

1025
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,080
good investment portals such as fars tweet for

1026
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,570
whoever started everything is fine and has

1027
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:35,240
started all this yet  Those places

1028
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,550
and

1029
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:38,810
after this that we talked about was

1030
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:40,630
information from a database like that of

1031
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:44,590
Facebook, there was also a history

1032
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:47,240
of information leaks, a bit what I

1033
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:50,060
had controlling sites such as

1034
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,980
non-payment havas and others is precisely

1035
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,750
having these databases  data and

1036
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:54,710
have them available for query

1037
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:57,740
ternas available for an integer or for

1038
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,200
enrichment with which of each

1039
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,210
eq  u type of investigation they have of

1040
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:04,010
police

1041
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:06,590
teams intelligence teams defense teams it

1042
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:08,510
is important to do this

1043
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:10,790
basic collection always within the

1044
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:12,620
possible of the country's legal frameworks,

1045
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:13,760
which requires a second

1046
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,700
or additional analysis but we

1047
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,080
are available are part of this

1048
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,340


1049
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:22,340
I work without having to use it and this in

1050
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:23,600
general research is extremely

1051
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,550
important where today we start with

1052
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:28,010
investments and roads that has many

1053
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:30,710
problems very little data sometimes it is

1054
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:32,930
part of a mix of a twitter user of

1055
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:35,560
the

1056
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:39,310
ting user from linkedin wherever many

1057
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:41,230
Sometimes the name is known but he knows nothing

1058
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:45,010
else, that is, the man there is a number of a

1059
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:46,990
user there is an indicator of a user

1060
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:48,330
on the network

1061
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:50,490
then women without

1062
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:51,450
automatic correlations have automatic tools

1063
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:52,860
for doing all this type of

1064
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:56,310
analysis and after many times the

1065
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:58,650
dependency  of the ability of a

1066
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:02,200
researcher who is dedicated to investigating

1067
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,790
who also makes his ca  For

1068
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:05,230
example, a payton program to

1069
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:06,520
maintain these scripts that we were

1070
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,920
seeing today castile is free and it is not its

1071
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,420
focus it should not be its focus it is not its

1072
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,430
specialty well then there should be

1073
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:14,230
a technical team or a solution that

1074
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:16,300
allows making this type of entities

1075
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:19,359
to  that a good investigation even

1076
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:21,520
without so many different perspectives for a

1077
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,920
generic case in an investigation

1078
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,810
is part of the coherence a

1079
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:28,329
known data then part of a

1080
00:44:28,329 --> 00:44:31,390
nickname of a nickname a nickname of

1081
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:35,070
a user in an email an IP address

1082
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:39,839
that is in your work is to pass  with

1083
00:44:40,549 --> 00:44:42,349
also research of looking for

1084
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:46,880
information and others where there are symptoms

1085
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,450
a very important value to

1086
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:52,420
start relating the

1087
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:55,930
user portal 5 I responded to that from

1088
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:58,000
there to start placing orders and there

1089
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,530
those two concepts begin that seem

1090
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:03,369
down there to the right of the sp  i sp i sp

1091
00:45:03,369 --> 00:45:05,740
like the internet you know how to prove the truth

1092
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:08,079
that is going to tell us well who is in

1093
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:09,970
front of a moment of this reality  The

1094
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:12,300
greatest link to the place what is the

1095
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:15,760
electronic is to provide a twitter country

1096
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,119
that is not to say, this user saw it

1097
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:22,599
in this mode at this exact time from

1098
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:24,310
this IP address

1099
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:27,370
and that IP address the neighbor of says

1100
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:29,350
with which there with order of  Judge and all the

1101
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:31,330
process that each country requires will be asked

1102
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:33,490
well who is the person the company the

1103
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:36,090
entity that was connected

1104
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:39,120
with that IP to that server and that life

1105
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,810
helping a person an entity an

1106
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:45,510
area I lie relationships with infants

1107
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:48,090
investigations the cycle returns  Complete

1108
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:49,890
when that is because it led to a

1109
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:54,210
good rationing, it is acquired that

1110
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:58,020
cell phones were adapted, that also a

1111
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:00,030
forensic analysis to a guy who says and

1112
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:02,010
that also to exploit with

1113
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:03,750
open source data cannot make those

1114
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:08,850
crosses whoever is an effort of

1115
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:11,340
social networks has a lot  value, well, you have to

1116
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:13,650
really take advantage of it at the government level,

1117
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:15,450
the same we that the

1118
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:17,250
telephone countries is used in

1119
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:18,630
our case but it is not left with

1120
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:21,440
Live information for other ordinary people

1121
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,339
share this requirement

1122
00:46:24,339 --> 00:46:26,349
is the public information that some

1123
00:46:26,349 --> 00:46:28,630
governments for transparency begin to

1124
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:30,910
publish and disseminate in which it

1125
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:33,309
is also a database to make an

1126
00:46:33,309 --> 00:46:35,589
enrichment and then towards

1127
00:46:35,589 --> 00:46:38,559
the listener governments also enrich

1128
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:40,569
with strict data not  of government

1129
00:46:40,569 --> 00:46:42,339
with accesses that can be had between

1130
00:46:42,339 --> 00:46:44,380
institutions, always seeking the

1131
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:46,719
greatest collaboration capacity to

1132
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:48,910
access hearing information within

1133
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:50,499
the corresponding frameworks and within

1134
00:46:50,499 --> 00:46:53,499
the corresponding contexts, but there is

1135
00:46:53,499 --> 00:46:54,850
non-police data on

1136
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:57,440
migratory Sebas that

1137
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,150
could also accompany these

1138
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:00,890
enrichment works  to do this type of

1139
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:03,869
analysis and that

1140
00:47:03,869 --> 00:47:07,890
this is now only side of your

1141
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:11,640
information and in the impact to happen but

1142
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,670
many attacks also happen by

1143
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:15,990
locations due to lack of application of

1144
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:17,789
parts and it is like the other part that

1145
00:47:17,789 --> 00:47:19,710
we have of the social network part is by

1146
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:22,529
one side educate him let's put

1147
00:47:22,529 --> 00:47:24,960
more data not  Let's give away the information well

1148
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,749
let's be clear that there have been fires and

1149
00:47:27,749 --> 00:47:29,460
problems and you will have data from

1150
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,410
people from the military and

1151
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:33,869
Latin American governments who in

1152
00:47:33,869 --> 00:47:35,460
turn have leaked information due to

1153
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,130
hacking and in turn there will be more

1154
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:39,509
those who have to leave that

1155
00:47:39,509 --> 00:47:41,009
premise wondered to do when it

1156
00:47:41,009 --> 00:47:42,779
has happened to us and this image is what you are

1157
00:47:42,779 --> 00:47:45,240
looking for but it is a little strange to say that

1158
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,799
we have even for which it is

1159
00:47:46,799 --> 00:47:49,349
responsibility because there is ours we did not

1160
00:47:49,349 --> 00:47:52,710
apply a patch we were hacked

1161
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:56,040
let's see what happens to us again well but

1162
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,930
what about  all these previous and

1163
00:47:57,930 --> 00:48:00,089
that many in this year passing in

1164
00:48:00,089 --> 00:48:01,349
time

1165
00:48:01,349 --> 00:48:05,210
are through attacks of steel as

1166
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:08,430
unknown, even

1167
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:10,470
attacks in that time of darkness that

1168
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:13,620
appears comes to the left in graphics

1169
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:17,580
where there is a personality at least

1170
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:20,340
for people where they do not know such  Sometimes

1171
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:22,650
only small groups that can

1172
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:24,630
get to know it and there we begin to move

1173
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:26,580
little by little towards the right in which the

1174
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:29,400
team appears.  Sometimes state

1175
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,610
sometimes private sometimes criminals that

1176
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:35,400
we detect from ages and I go out to exploit it

1177
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,440
and it begins to do its work of

1178
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,780
exploitation yes that it has taken a

1179
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:43,050
protection at least native of protection

1180
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:44,910
that well there may be there they appear a lot

1181
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:47,070
and they are going to be in a better position

1182
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:49,890
these companies organizations that can

1183
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:50,940
give those layers of

1184
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:52,920
compensatory controls that can work

1185
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,290
or people in that early detection in

1186
00:48:55,290 --> 00:48:57,090
evaluated from another way

1187
00:48:57,090 --> 00:48:58,920
lawrence and be able to really protect from

1188
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,550
day 0 in green energies so I

1189
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:04,350
am listing etcetera

1190
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:06,680
solutions that explain some kind

1191
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:10,030
modeling and apply algorithm

1192
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,770
from machine learning or

1193
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:13,840
artificial intensity that they will protect despite the fact that

1194
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:16,090
there is a zero host in which we

1195
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:19,300
have to be killed well but this type of

1196
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,550
attack as you can see has a

1197
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:24,130
very large window, that is, our positions

1198
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:26,320
where it is  the risk is very great and

1199
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,090
this entity is very large located

1200
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,520
governments it is very difficult to protect in e

1201
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:33,070
What is expected about gods we are going to

1202
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,620
have incidents we have to see in what

1203
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:37,720
way we reduce, minimize and with

1204
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:40,960
we have that impact has in the face of those

1205
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,340
situations that can harm and

1206
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:43,930
these

1207
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:46,690
system if the system suffered then it is

1208
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:49,510
important to contain and recover

1209
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:51,940
early

1210
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:54,490
in turn from  2003 is an

1211
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:57,460
environmental report from cisco, well it is always

1212
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:59,760
presenting us because they impress

1213
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,380
that 44 percent of the alerts that we

1214
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:05,170
investigated are a black hole that

1215
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:06,940
eats up the alerts

1216
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,380
and after those that are well investigated,

1217
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,710


1218
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:12,829
many

1219
00:50:12,829 --> 00:50:15,820
are remedied and others  not good

1220
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:18,520
s 54% paris down in red that I am going to

1221
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:21,430
make a redder red still they are not

1222
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:23,620
legitimate alerts and that we

1223
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,420
mid another black hole of the

1224
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,220
general sky 3 normally what we

1225
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:29,870
visualize today

1226
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:33,380
in very little inclusive of the systems

1227
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:35,540
in turn imagine that  We have many

1228
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:37,310
issues that warn the new ones registered

1229
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:39,710
correctly and that neither the soft nor the

1230
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:41,480
thorn was going to be able to see it until it

1231
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,300
suc  From the incident

1232
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:46,700
then from others to happen or to be giving

1233
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:49,100
in another apprehension good following a

1234
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:51,350
little tennis models mainly not to

1235
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:52,880
say that we do not work in preparation

1236
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,860
in prevention listener to the issue of

1237
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:57,140
monitoring protection and detection and

1238
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:58,100
then they continue this work of

1239
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:00,890
containment response very good later

1240
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:03,890
to the continuous improvement work on learned facts to

1241
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:06,470
work in a context of

1242
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:08,630
what the cybersecurity environment is, which

1243
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:10,520
is a technical aspect that today we have

1244
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:13,070
to work on, but not stay at

1245
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:16,910
zero in a policy area, but we

1246
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:17,990
must really work on those

1247
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:19,640
technical aspects to improve and

1248
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:22,330
avoid this leak has been good to

1249
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:25,280
try to close it as soon as possible

1250
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,420
a series of conclusions simply

1251
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:29,630
but to work on this monitoring in general,

1252
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:31,250
early registrations and information from

1253
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:33,410
facebook left we want to be attentive as it

1254
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:34,730
happens to us to

1255
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:36,859
do this monitoring of  the lics continuous

1256
00:51:36,859 --> 00:51:38,900
monitoring of social networks

1257
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:42,520
in the face of stations and p  patrolling

1258
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:46,899
these large volumes of

1259
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:51,440
data requires large volumes of

1260
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,090
data to process data I have

1261
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:55,390
to be prepared for that incorporate

1262
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:57,380
technology algorithm is machine

1263
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:58,520
learning artificial intelligence

1264
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:02,150
really today in academia is going by leaps and

1265
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:04,820
bounds in these aspects

1266
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,560
all the papers of the  world and declared that they

1267
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,940
are knowing that some kind of the subject

1268
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:10,160
of fragile ring from artificial to

1269
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,590
start incorporating it in cybersecurity

1270
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:15,500
as soon as possible either with tools

1271
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,390
or manually and through this type

1272
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:20,270
of analysis well take advantage of

1273
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:23,650
this data then improve the information

1274
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:25,480
and good take  These photos, stories,

1275
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,830
investigations of this information leak,

1276
00:52:26,830 --> 00:52:29,200
as far as possible, the government

1277
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,870
make their crosses with data that with

1278
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:33,520
being strict correlate those in the face

1279
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,820
of investigations and really cayón in

1280
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:38,590
integrating and investigations buying

1281
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:40,690
what is or but as opensource

1282
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:42,370
intelligence as a mechanism today of

1283
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:44,230
available information ending

1284
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:45,730
Being today within the legal framework of

1285
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:48,270
major countries

1286
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:49,590
so well, I hope you have been

1287
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:51,780
interesting the presentation that you

1288
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:55,020
liked, we managed to cover a little these

1289
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:57,570
these main leaks and I impart the one

1290
00:52:57,570 --> 00:52:58,620
on facebook with a brief

1291
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:01,950
regional analysis and a little of at least a

1292
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:03,810
sample of  What can be the focus to

1293
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:06,120
see what chili they have left and I contact myself

1294
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,220
fully available so that you can

1295
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:09,990
consult me, write to me, ask me for more

1296
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:12,420
information, it is also Pablo who wants

1297
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:14,790
etcetera, welcome so good in

1298
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:16,320
everything that can cause welcome and

1299
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,760
took advantage of these last minutes  What

1300
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,940
remains to be congratulated once again on every

1301
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:23,220
3.8 dollar organization that excellent

1302
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:26,160
everything they do since day 1 and good

1303
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,190
and that is to say to accompany this type of

1304
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:30,210
proposals I do not think it is very important

1305
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:31,530
also all that support they have had

1306
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:33,870
from this third is for  make this

1307
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:35,730
event possible and be able to collaborate and

1308
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:38,610
share this type of descriptions

1309
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:40,440
information about what is happening today

1310
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,210
in the gov  Hell so thank you very

1311
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:44,190
much and we were available for

1312
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:45,900
any questions, ask questions,

1313
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,540
comments,

1314
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:50,570
thank you, mate if we are

1315
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:52,820
waiting for some questions to appear in the chats and in our

1316
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:54,380
networks for

1317
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:55,700
this tremendous presentation.

1318
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,480


1319
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,550
a

1320
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:02,650
favor we are giving away we are

1321
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:04,090
giving away good work books and we are

1322
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:06,100
giving away t-shirts from previous conferences

1323
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,440
, it would seem wonderful if

1324
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,780
you ask a question at this time

1325
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:11,890
for our audience that is

1326
00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:14,830
connected with 8.8 government and

1327
00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:17,140
that obviously answers it within the

1328
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:18,250
people who  respond within the

1329
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:19,990
hashtag we are going to raffle that prize, you

1330
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:21,310
think if you help us with a question

1331
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:23,350
for the audience

1332
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:25,960
that responds first exactly the

1333
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:28,240
number of records played

1334
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,460
from chile's facebook the first correct way is to

1335
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:33,040
say I to the perfect shirt francisco

1336
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,330
fuenzalida our dear is my  it
