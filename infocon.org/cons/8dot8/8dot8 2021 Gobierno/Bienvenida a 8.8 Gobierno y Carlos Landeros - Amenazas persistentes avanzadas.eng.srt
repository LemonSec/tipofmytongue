00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:33,200
welcome to one and the first session and

3
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,260
perhaps the first also of the year of 8.8

4
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,760
that this time opens with a

5
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,440
very special session the first one that hopes will

6
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,870
last for a long time and is 8.8

7
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,210
government, an instance that has been

8
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,920
working for a long time  time between

9
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,350
us and him that is to say that essentially

10
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,340
seeks to try to expand and publicize,

11
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,199
educate, train on

12
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:56,300
cybersecurity issues about our entire country,

13
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,379
which is basing with a process as

14
00:00:57,379 --> 00:00:58,430
interesting as digital transformation

15
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,420
, as this point is very much a

16
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,530
group association of people  that

17
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,050
we work essentially doing

18
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,760
conferences this is also the first

19
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,710
conference of the year of our cycle the

20
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,060
first massive large public open conference

21
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,130
where we will have guests

22
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:14,780
from different parts of the world with

23
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,310
very interesting content that you

24
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,600
can also appreciate and can

25
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,659
find out through www 8.8 point

26
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:22,790
because  we are going to see people from israel from

27
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:23,659
estonia

28
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:25,130
we have a forum of mu  Wonderful Latin American jer

29
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,470
and precisely because we have

30
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,940
that forum and because this is part and they are

the organization they are let's say one

33
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,690
member more than 8.8 we have the people who are

34
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,549
members of the ces and I meet with

35
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:38,960
katelynas channels who will be my

36
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,220
partner please  Well, if you want

37
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,650
you can spend

38
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,210
hello

39
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,990
and microphone, while

40
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,610
we are going to while

41
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:55,390
all the technical equipment is installed to leave,

42
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,070
we finish that today

43
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,510
we are going to have

44
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,580
very important government authorities that are going to take advantage of

45
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,320
talking and starting precisely also

46
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,660
this cycle of 8.8 in the year that we

47
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,100
think is super relevant to start with

48
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,380
a government issue with a country

49
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,669
issue with government and country issues that are

50
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:11,320
also going to see us in the future that I

51
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,700
find super interesting

52
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:17,770
there is the signal of  that although he hopes

53
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,330
that he can be here we are going to have

54
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,160
the microphone installed in the 5 minutes my

55
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,540
butt but we continue commenting that

56
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,700
we are going  to also have the possibility

57
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,080
that you can talk share

58
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,850
in the chat we have different communities

59
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:31,360
so that you can connect in 828 you can

60
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,790
follow us on instagram on facebook on

61
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,070
twitter on discs where the community

62
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,020
remains mostly active and remember

63
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,130
that we are dating through the

64
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,890
signal of  Peace line here in these

65
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,300
wonderful studies that we have arranged

66
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,590
today and that present part of the

67
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:48,250
standard that will have 8.8 during

68
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,230
while we wait for you to look at Kateryna

69
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,940
who is going to join us and is going to

70
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,070
be our pair had during this

71
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,660
wonderful transmission where we have

72
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,400
different  contents we are going to open the

73
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,070
fires by citing the first authority

74
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,770
that is going to receive us today that is

75
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,959
going to start this beginning we are going to leave

76
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,150
you with the minister of the interior

77
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,380
and state security don rodrigo

78
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,940
slim who has some words to

79
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,980
give  beginning of this first

80
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,530
historic session of 8.8 government

81
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,350
the pandemic has forced us to adapt

82
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:21,200
to a n  ueva normality teleworking

83
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,510
and digitization became something

84
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,490
everyday and of great importance

85
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,190
obviously in our day to day so

86
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,020
those who work who study

87
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,730
and of course the family in general

88
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,739
know that advancing according to

89
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:35,989
current times is key and that is why

90
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:37,610
our  The government has defined

91
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,980
the modernization of the state

92
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,050
as a fundamental axis since institutions

93
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,819
capable of adapting to the

94
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:46,760
digital advances of our time are required and with the

95
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,380
new tool challenges also come,

96
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,360
of course, in the second

97
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,269
half of 2020 it has suffered 525

98
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:56,150
million cyberattack attempts.

99
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,650
What reinforces our obligation to

100
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,870
consider cybersecurity as a

101
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,060
fundamental element is because of all the

102
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,280
above that we work as a government

103
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,560
and especially that of the

104
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,230
interior ministry for promoting initiatives such as

105
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:12,470
the one that calls us today 8.8 government

106
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,360
because enhancing and developing

107
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,608
skills in cybersecurity is one  of

108
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:19,279
the objectives of this activity  All

109
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,480
that remains for me is to wish you

110
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,340
that this activity will be of great use

111
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,440
to you because we cannot even

112
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,810
think about a digital government and a

113
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,700
digital transformation of the state without

114
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,770
putting cybersecurity as a cornerstone

115
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,520


116
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,440
because it is important in

117
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,030
cybersecurity because precisely in

118
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,230
these years  so fateful that we are

119
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,830
living

120
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,230
we have known we have seen how

121
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,820
technology has been expanding and has

122
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,230
required many people to

123
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,610
plan all the information with the

124
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,980
sensitive data of their company also to

125
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,900
their homes to their family today

126
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,640
cybersecurity is part  of a process

127
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,680
that must also contain the

128
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,510
citizen standing up so to speak and not

129
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,150
only large companies and

130
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,140
also has to do with

131
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,390
data protection and that also works that is to

132
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,220
say that it is the body that is the

133
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,140
response of  cybersecurity by

134
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,200
the government on cybersecurity issues

135
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,180
as of today our following

136
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,550
the presenter on  The director

137
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,169
precisely and the director who is here

138
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:17,270
is already stagnant. The change was a relief

139
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,770
presented but we are going to see if she

140
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:21,240
is ready to go

141
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,490
to the plate as they would say on television

142
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,650
with you.

143
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,100


144
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,140
Immediately

145
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,420
but clearly this with this time and with the

146
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,800
pandemic and with everything that has happened in

147
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,270
this period, streaming technologies

148
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,730
have grown enormously,

149
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,470
technologies around work at home

150
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,360
have grown normally in bloom

151
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,040
, connectivity applications have grown

152
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,680
enormously and a  A lot of other elements

153
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,660
are precisely available

154
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,340
for security to occupy it but without knowing

155
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,810
what the risks are or what the

156
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:51,890
responsibilities that it also has to

157
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:54,290
have and in that we are working 8.8 and now

158
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:57,310
it is also about to

159
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:02,110
have things very well very

160
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,270
happy  to be here this is our

161
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,490
first 8.8 with the vertical that has

162
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,990
government with the trajectory and

163
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,729
experience  It is obvious that you have the ability to

164
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:11,710
share these

165
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,960
special moments with this, which is also

166
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,180
given by the function that we have

167
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,560
of training public officials,

168
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,660
then generating this alliance through

169
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,310
either the collaboration agreement that

170
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,680
we signed last year these are the

171
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,000
samples of  that the agreements are not

172
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,270
just signatures is not just taking photos and

173
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,620
shaking hands but they have a

174
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,780
representation that today serves us and

175
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,100
helps us effectively to be able to

176
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,380
develop and bring to all

177
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,240
citizens this event as important

178
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,370
as 8.8 with its vertical government

179
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,020
Clearly and with a particularly

180
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,190
complex year because digital transformation

181
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,190
is an issue within the state

182
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,630
where many processes have also had to evangelize

183
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,940
with many companies, many processes that

184
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,979
often resist the change of

185
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:52,630
technology and among understandable they are

186
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,580
new generations, it has advanced very

187
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,630
fast especially in  In the last two

188
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,699
years, the issue of digital platforms has advanced a lot.

189
00:06:57,699 --> 00:06:59,050
gitals then for

190
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,949
you it has been a good burden

191
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,040
not only in the digital transformation are

192
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,750
processes that are also going

193
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,320
hand in hand with obviously legislative processes

194
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,160
but we also have

195
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,170
artificial intelligence that is a

196
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,480
phenomenon that today is taking not

197
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,370
only the international sphere

198
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,380
The government is also launching

199
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,210
the first

200
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,040
national artificial intelligence policy very soon, remember that

201
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,930
all this cybersecurity started

202
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,550
with the implementation of the

203
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,680
national cybersecurity policy and we already see

204
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,990
that after almost four years all

205
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,280
the advances that have been made all  the

206
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,770
things that we have been able to achieve and in that

207
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,630
sense obviously we also hope that

208
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,710
the implementation plan of a

209
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:38,700
national artificial intelligence policy

210
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,500
will bring us all the

211
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,660
benefits that politics left us today

212
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,180
in the matter that we summon us,

213
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,590
which is cybersecurity but

214
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,970
transformation  digital

215
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,790
artificial intelligence and threat e  n cybernetics, the

216
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:53,490
risk that is latent today

217
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,770
worldwide, that is, think that today people

218
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,980
are living their lives through the

219
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,040
networks yesterday we were putting a

220
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,410
title on it and we said our life in the

221
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,540
cloud as a day ago we spent all of

222
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,050


223
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,599
our photos in our  memories all

224
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,389
our lives to clouds that are in

225
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:14,069
spaces where we do not have

226
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:16,860
control before we printed the mobile

227
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,449
our photographs we had our

228
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:20,759
albums and you keep them we understand

229
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,530
and piano we have a backup and we can

230
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:24,449
access it whenever we want if

231
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:26,009
with each one  technology is put into it

232
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:28,080
, a new crime comes out in a simple

233
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,389
crime some new reality always

234
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:32,279
help you always have to be attentive at

235
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,360
that time the super

236
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,250
important monitoring for those processes but it is

237
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,510
complex when you have to monitor the

238
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,799
whole country, especially we are thinking

239
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,729
that you also have to  think about

240
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:40,799
citizens and the data

241
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,690
that protect them at the same time that it is

242
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,159
real  Hoisting or working on the

243
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,480
new cybersecurity law where

244
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,220
precisely there are also issues such

245
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,630
as establishing the difference between

246
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,610
the cybercriminal and a never critical hacker,

247
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,110
which are the people who look for

248
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,450
vulnerabilities, so when we

249
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,430
see this phenomenon effectively,

250
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,070
that is, it works supported  Obviously from

251
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,350
the people who notify us last month

252
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,540
we saw notifications from more than

253
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,640
100 citizens who notify you

254
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,620
in fraudulent on-site fitz that is, there is

255
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,420
also a collaboration on the part

256
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,610
of citizen researchers that is

257
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,529
obviously taken, we verify it with a

258
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:16,350
team and the  Publications that you

259
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,360
sell the csic is part of the

260
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,269
collaborative work that cecil himself does to a

261
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,879
great extent, but he

262
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:25,980
comes from even other officials of

263
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,990
public institutions and for that

264
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,209
the registration within

265
00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:32,069
the csirt website is always open so that the

266
00:09:32,069 --> 00:09:34,230
citizens and the normal public

267
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,629
may be raising our alerts

268
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:38,790
So there is always a synergy, there is

269
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,309
a collaboration, we know that in

270
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:44,069
concessioned cybersecurity, GDP does not

271
00:09:44,069 --> 00:09:46,499
compete, but rather that door, then

272
00:09:46,499 --> 00:09:48,839
this contribution generates a bond of

273
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,019
trust that then leads you to be able to

274
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:53,309
report incidents when it happens to you

275
00:09:53,309 --> 00:09:55,319
because you know that there is no one to help you.

276
00:09:55,319 --> 00:09:57,899
controls and accuses you and does not know the

277
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:00,300
concept of social resilience that is

278
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,339
very important when some type

279
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:04,079
of incident happens because everyone says and

280
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,389
look what happened but let's see the

281
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:08,069
work behind the policies that have

282
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:09,540
been taken let's see the procedure that

283
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,339
They adopted let's review those

284
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:13,439
filter videos that we learn and each incident

285
00:10:13,439 --> 00:10:15,690
is a complete class it

286
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,300
has been a long time we are trying to

287
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,890
generate a standard protocol of

288
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,510
response to the incident obviously to be

289
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,730
able to share it but it costs us a lot

290
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,530
because here the following shows you

291
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,870
that maybe you could have something  made better

292
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:30,270
and independently things and depending

293
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,920
obviously on the variants and stam

294
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,600
Talking about data leakage of some

295
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,240
malware or some ransomware that

296
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,490
were so fashionable last year,

297
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,080
obviously a different protocol generated us,

298
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,130
a different perfect action and as

299
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,510
the issue with the pandemic has been, it

300
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:49,020
accelerated, it increased as more companies grew, they

301
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,880
began to  try to get closer

302
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,720
to you to try to find

303
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,640
training look for information what

304
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,050
happened during that process I am interested in

305
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,160
knowing it because it seems to me an

306
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,990
important historical document to know how Chile

307
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,730
adapted technologically in these

308
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,280
terms to this period

309
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,570
I always like history so

310
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,280
always  I had that as if I wanted to

311
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,870
be part of history or of some

312
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,730
historical phenomenon as now we feel

313
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,620
that clearly within our generation

314
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,230
little had happened in general, I felt I

315
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,210
had left law school and

316
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,100
there was not that political social movement

317
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,329
that existed for

318
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:19,730
a decade  before ours

319
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,559
then I think it is the birth and day of

320
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:24,799
a phenomenon  where you actually have

321
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,360
an almost complete citizenship at home,

322
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,100
how long were we in the pandemic

323
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,230
where we had to communicate through

324
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,939
electronic means where we had

325
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:35,549
to go to classes to work on

326
00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:37,829
unthinkable paradigms that we had not even

327
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:39,509
represented ourselves in the best of cases

328
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:41,549
then certainly  The digital transformation

329
00:11:41,549 --> 00:11:44,189
is the best and the driving force behind the

330
00:11:44,189 --> 00:11:46,470
digital transformation was the pandemic and

331
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,869
in that sense they actually arose in

332
00:11:48,869 --> 00:11:51,420
addition, given all the benefits and the

333
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,850
effects of the pandemic,

334
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,980
the risk increased and the risk increased because

335
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,449
cybercriminals realized that they

336
00:11:57,449 --> 00:11:59,579
had a field  new where

337
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:01,769
benefits could come directly then

338
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:04,259
as I do not know any social benefit

339
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:07,379
bond rescheduling of banks and

340
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:08,309
now

341
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:11,279
the return of 10% mixed within

342
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,869
an income operation that also had a

343
00:12:12,869 --> 00:12:15,899
benefit generates a lot of material for

344
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:18,660
cybercriminals given

345
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,249
obviously appealing to the phenomenon of social engineering

346
00:12:20,249 --> 00:12:22,259
what  Since this was studied, trying to get

347
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:24,430
to psychology obviously

348
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:29,020
generates a need for you

349
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,700
and since you are already receiving everything

350
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,770
through our emails, we are

351
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:33,670
one click

352
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,660
closer to being vulnerable and above

353
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,649
all what is the forgiveness

354
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:40,000
I hope to be a person asks about

355
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,320
Well, it is important with the hand for the

356
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,870
citizenship but what is the entire

357
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:47,320
target of the highest incidence in this type

358
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,980
of crime when any

359
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,779
age range is the ones that mostly fall into this

360
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:55,540
type of scams or who are previously

361
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,310
the target of these criminals if

362
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,410
we  we make the distinction between two

363
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,940
people there is something we consider

364
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,529
to be the most vulnerable groups and

365
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:03,880
others that are the most attacked groups

366
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,440
within the most vulnerable groups

367
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,480
we always understand that children,

368
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,300
adolescents and older adults are

369
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,230
the first because they do not have the

370
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:14,260
necessary protection  Either because of their level

371
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,420
of intellectual maturity, you know that

372
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,550
children today also have hi  Those who are

373
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,070
old then share all

374
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,650
their lives are on the internet and today

375
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,390
that they also cannot be closer with

376
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,550
their friends they use social networks much more

377
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,720
many

378
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,520
use much more they are consumers of 'tik

379
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,910
tok' things unthinkable for us are

380
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,650
very consumers of  instagram chat

381
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,210
they do not communicate and by whatsapp nor do

382
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,230
they

383
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,330
communicate through facebook that is, facebook does not

384
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:43,120
exist almost for it so in that

385
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,790
the parents are so far away from these

386
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,200
new technologies

387
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,940
or those new tools that children

388
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,710
are using that effectively the bases

389
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,030
they are more vulnerable because they do not have

390
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,220
parental control and older adults

391
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,870
because they are at the other extreme where you

392
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:59,820
actually do not have a

393
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,070
closeness or an ability to use the

394
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:07,680
most technological lack of knowledge

395
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,970
is part of everything I think on the one

396
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,610
hand I do not know  they feel there there is

397
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:15,670
universal access understanding it exists

398
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,740
therefore obviously they have to enter

399
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,710
either to have a plan of tea  Mobile

400
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:23,110
phone that comes with data or having

401
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,510
internet at home and after that is

402
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,820
the connection because ultimately

403
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,770
what leads you to consume a product

404
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,620
is knowing how to use it, so empathy in

405
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,210
that sense is given to our

406
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,250
generation, that is, we have to

407
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,780
be  those of us who help our

408
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,060
parents, our grandparents, but also

409
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,920
with safety tips, listen to dad,

410
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,880
mom, be careful with this

411
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,960
about safety tips, if it is

412
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,800
also new, even the one that is already

413
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,200
entering this world in that sense,

414
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,820
obviously they are the ones that we

415
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,020
consider the  more

416
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,280
vulnerable sectors we are always launching

417
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,630
campaigns we are always trying to

418
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,880
educate but on the other hand

419
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,790
we effectively have a range between 20 and 50

420
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,520
years old that one could say I entered of course

421
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,290
there are people who actually continue to

422
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:11,080
fall into fitur I remember that I do not know

423
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,120
in the  Last summer there was the promotion

424
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,660
of

425
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,480
your empty crown and click here and we will give you a

426
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,350
blessed one of crowns one says is  free and I

427
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:24,230
started we know that when something free is

428
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,029
because you produce not the other side

429
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:30,019
but finally this feeling of wanting to

430
00:15:30,019 --> 00:15:32,360
have something free of wanting to get something

431
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,610
leads us many times to fall into the fit

432
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,769
without clicking that redirects us to

433
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,209
sites that are fraudulent that  sometimes

434
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:40,250
it is our credentials and those

435
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,529
credentials are later exposed so that

436
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:43,730
we are going to talk and we would be the whole

437
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,769
program

438
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:46,970
ourselves we are doing

439
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,889
from our data in a way that

440
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:51,170
we do not realize that it has something from

441
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,269
everywhere one gave it seems to

442
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:54,620
any  benefit that has a lot

443
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,089
of data and that accumulates and

444
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:57,230
then through a

445
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,439
fairly simple passive discovery procedure

446
00:15:59,439 --> 00:16:01,730
you can have enough background to

447
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,290
do a pretty good social engineering

448
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,149
but that work is from csic

449
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:08,600
and 8.8 joins to collaborate precisely in

450
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,769
that  work try to expand the

451
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,600
information necessary for this part

452
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,009
avoid this type of incident try  to

453
00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:14,689
also avoid this type of scam

454
00:16:14,689 --> 00:16:16,129
try to try to avoid

455
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:18,620
precisely the growth of these

456
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,970
characters who live off technology and

457
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:20,930
their advances

458
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,060
to take advantage of other people one of

459
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,580
the graces of 8.8 is that it has had the

460
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,750
possibility to communicate or be in

461
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,190
Contact with hackers from all over the

462
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,140
world where we have seen that this is not

463
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,000
only a national issue in Chile, it

464
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,860
is an issue that we have seen many times

465
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,170
in other countries in an 8.8

466
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,180
four years ago a Korean boy came,

467
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,740
I remember he commented that these

468
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,110
things exist  and today we are already

469
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,149
seeing them here we are suffering it in our

470
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:45,620
own flesh so it is also super important to

471
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,209
understand that these conferences are

472
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:48,649
not only to educate but also

473
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:49,850
to prevent what is coming,

474
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,550
always know what is

475
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,140
present and in fact we have a talk

476
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,950
of current threats, so it is within the

477
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,050
day that we are going to share with you

478
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,760
so there we will also give

479
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,200
later p  or at least put it in the

480
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,540
conjuncture of what is cybersecurity

481
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,790
- in which don carlos landero is a little

482
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,679
behind,

483
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:11,449
let's think that we leave a little

484
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:13,099
pause with some mincers of

485
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:15,439
us we have a couple of a couple of

486
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,520
spots that we want to share with  You,

487
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,410
who are the people who have not done anything,

488
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,530


489
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,680
have allowed us to carry out this event with the

490
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,760
quality that you will appreciate

491
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,680
during the experience from today

492
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,930
until 4 afternoons, so we are going to

493
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:31,350
keep a little what is to say a video

494
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,870
which will explain precisely how it works

495
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,700
and what are the qualities to say and

496
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,650
after that we leave you with one of the

497
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:38,700
first brands of a support that is

498
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,260
navy for now they leave it with this video

499
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,940
we return immediately to each study

00:18:16,639 --> 00:18:19,220
world is what we do every day on the

507
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,159
web everything we do what we want

508
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:25,730
and what we are is in line  nea but the

509
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,990
internet also has risks today

510
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,240
threats can end our pace

511
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,230
of life and stop the country's progress

512

539
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:51,929

where we take advantage of catching up a

564
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,820
bit with  Country issues that have to

565
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,260
do with cybersecurity our first

566
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,160
panelist, also a

567
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,410
government entity that is presenting at this

568
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,540
time, is the director directly of the

569
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,300
csic who is going to tell us a little about

570
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,580
the current threats that are

571
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,350
present and also is going to give us a

572
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:33,740
little a day of what the plan is precisely

573
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,560
on this issue of cybersecurity

574
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,020
that is why don carlos landero is with us,

575
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,150
who is already there being

576
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,710
harassed with the microphones, you are here to be

577
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:45,110
able to get out  before in this study and

578
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,960
begin your presentation that opens the

579
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,700
fires as I tell you about this first

580
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,970
edition of 8.8 government, an edition that

581
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:54,950
we think and hope will be present

582
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:57,220
in the coming years after 11 years

583
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,720
8.8 within all the conferences that it

584
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,190
holds in the year  add this new

585
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,540
date this

586
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,520
so that you can

587
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,870
basically continue with the information,

588
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:08,090
training and progress in all

589
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,800
technology issues that is part of

598
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,640
lot of time they are complex

599
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,170
years they are unfortunate years where cybersecurity has

600
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:38,000
been a particular issue we talked about it without

601
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,440
con  catherine to the

602
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,150
digital transformation of the country seriously accelerated by the

603
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:43,850
pandemic therefore much much of the

604
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:47,990
effort of how to say it  with having this

605
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,370
transformation to be what it has

606
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:52,220
to be depends on you in cash

607
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,840
in a great effort that we are

608
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,750
making

609
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,310
at some point it is our turn as

610
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,720
a public official to make a double

611
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,030
effort and this moment to respond

612
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:04,360
to the citizen of the country so proud

613
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,890
not only  Of the work that

614
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,240
we do but of all our colleagues,

615
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,430
the government is giving the race and

616
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:12,130
working for the pandemic issue and

617
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,800
equal social conditions and

618
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,570
just a grain of sand to give back to the country

619
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,130
everything that has given us perfect, we

620
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,350
leave you with the scenario  It is all yours

621
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,160
begins the presentation we leave you

622
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,260
then with don carlos necessary here in

623
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:28,110
8.8 governments and thank you very much

624
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:35,020
you can see the battle that has been spent

625
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,580
there is the presentation you yes

626
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:40,840
excellent good in this situation

627
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,059
we are going to talk about the risks of the

628
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:45,760
supply chain this  it is a new topic it

629
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,390
is something that did not exist a year ago as

630
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:52,080
a declaration of attack already defined

631
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,640
regrettably  nte adds to all the

632
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,799
issues we have from

633
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,450
cybersecurity to information security lack of

634
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,460
budget lack of technical resources

635
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,590
now we have to add a

636
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,510
new variable that is related to the

637
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,760
risks of the supply chain,

638
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,799
as I said, not only happens at the

639
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,809
international level  but it is also already

640
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:12,429
happening at the national level and

641
00:27:12,429 --> 00:27:14,110
unfortunately it is not happening

642
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:17,260
in the government as well, so this type of risk is to make known

643
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,020
this type of variables,

644
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,760
which is what we want to expose

645
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,250
as we see it and what measure

646
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:27,190
we are suggesting to be able to apply if

647
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:28,779
we go to the  point of view of a context

648
00:27:28,779 --> 00:27:31,899
that is to say what the supply chain refers to

649
00:27:31,899 --> 00:27:33,820
or the attacks the

650
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,549
supply chain is also linked

651
00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:37,840


652
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,909
or whatever the battle in the value chain is also called, that is to say when

653
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:41,020


654
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:44,170
an attacker or begins to  directly attack

655
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,060
a company or a public institution

656
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,340
that is a little more robust that has

657
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,380
more capacity to better defend itself

658
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,270
infraes  tructure seeks to arrive in an

659
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:55,270
intermediate way through a nexus or

660
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,920
through a bridge that allows us to

661
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,870
go directly to this institution that

662
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,880
should be much more fair and this is

663
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,250
happening so pay attention to some tips

664
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,170
that we are going to give during our

665
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:07,690
information  when we are added to

666
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,880
issues of digital transformation where

667
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,100
we have to comply with pm where we have

668
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,410
to provide solutions to society for

669
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:16,330
bond issues or for issues of a

670
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,520
single key virtual police station and different

671
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,320
different systems that the government is

672
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,720
delivering, we are affected

673
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,560
and brought to  have larger platforms

674
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,110
available today available on the internet

675
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:32,440
but that is where we also see that

676
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,440
moss outsources very calmly or

677
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,330
very relaxed these services such as

678
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:39,520
monitoring monitoring of those

679
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,880
nok monitoring outsourcing

680
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,220
software development and development of apps for

681
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,730
software where we do not have much yet we

682
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,630
also develop support

683
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,390
administration and in the case of our

684
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:53,590
transfer  renting we also have our

685
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,240
due to this analyzed as the Ministry

686
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,040
of the Interior where it has full access

687
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,290
to our databases and our

688
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:00,580
platforms such as elektra and for example

689
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:03,160
then it is risky, it is risky to

690
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,730
outsource this type of services and it is

691
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:09,700
also difficult to detect this type

692
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,890
because which  you create a relationship

693
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:14,170
of trust with your provider with you with

694
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,059
you with the external company but you do not

695
00:29:16,059 --> 00:29:17,799
know if the attacker enters through there or not it

696
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:20,440
is super difficult to detect it when you

697
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,150
have a contribution

698
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:24,400
interconnection, a service interconnection or an

699
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,140
interconnection via the web  service then it

700
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,980
is difficult it costs a lot but it is

701
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,929
extremely dangerous and even more so when you

702
00:29:31,929 --> 00:29:33,760
generate this bond of trust not

703
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,860
only with one company but with

704
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,419
many other companies and through

705
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:39,280
digital training or interconnection with

706
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,049
other services we are interconnected

707
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:43,030
in different ways with others

708
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:46,929
utilities then it is dangerous and it is a

709
00:29:46,929 --> 00:29:50,049
new variable and  They are looking for,

710
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:53,020
basically, the platforms or the

711
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:56,050
security niches, I do not want to

712
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:58,960
go through the firewall barriers for the intrusion

713
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,020
detection barriers, whatever

714
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,480
it is, but rather look for a quick way

715
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,580
to fight with him, have him by

716
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,080
phone if they are the providers of

717
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,720
Internet to fight against the rc and

718
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,510
a fairly stable or robust network with

719
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,730
100% of the minutes for many months so

720
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,340
that I better look for a different way and

721
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,740
this way is to arrive via the

722
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,990
intermediary or via the provider and here

723
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,910
are examples that also in Chile  They are

724
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:27,250
quite clear and robust we all know

725
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:30,190
about the robustness and knowledge

726
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,840
and expertise that red band has

727
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,910
developed that year and I put it as an

728
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,710
example unfortunately but in 2018

729
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,750
something so much that the chicle bank or well

730
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,450
until the consortium bank 2019 was

731
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:42,430
affected  network they have a

732
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:44,080
robust cybersecurity team having a

733
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,910
manager who in rays brightest in

734
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:48,070
Chile in you on security issues but the

735
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:51,610
same thing happened to them why  e for the attack on a

736
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:53,530
channel is a minister that is, in all for

737
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:55,150
a present mediate already by a third party

738
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:56,980
for a subcontracting

739
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,809
and it happened the same

740
00:30:58,809 --> 00:31:00,879
if we see it now as risks what

741
00:31:00,879 --> 00:31:02,710
are the risks the supply chain the

742
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:05,679
first is the design phase or  Either

743
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,600
there are indeed vulnerabilities

744
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,450
with intention or without intention but that

745
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:12,639
there are logical

746
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:16,120
design vulnerabilities or a bad design that leaves us

747
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,100
the door open in this type of case

748
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,600
and for example an international example

749
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,999
that is the issue of phones

750
00:31:21,999 --> 00:31:24,610
detected with traffic  or in development

751
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:27,159
of Chinese companies in US phones that

752
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:29,019
sends information and has been backed up

753
00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:31,450
every 72 hours from certain phones and

754
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:33,369
these devices does China in our case

755
00:31:33,369 --> 00:31:36,009
is we fully trust the

756
00:31:36,009 --> 00:31:38,019
design of a supplier of ours does not do

757
00:31:38,019 --> 00:31:39,429
for any application for any

758
00:31:39,429 --> 00:31:41,590
application of  social fund or by some

759
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,419
cobit application we fully trust

760
00:31:43,419 --> 00:31:45,999
that and I have doubts as to

761
00:31:45,999 --> 00:31:48,249
other risks is development  and

762
00:31:48,249 --> 00:31:50,499
production, that is, who developed the

763
00:31:50,499 --> 00:31:52,539
software for us, who develops us

764
00:31:52,539 --> 00:31:54,759
in the software and what way leads us

765
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:56,919
to the production or operation of this

766
00:31:56,919 --> 00:31:58,720
issue and here we have the case of solar

767
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,850
wind, a company that is also a

768
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,649
provider of the cesid of the ministry

769
00:32:02,649 --> 00:32:04,929
interior in which an attacker for

770
00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:05,710
months

771
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:08,020
within and within the normal operation

772
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,309
of the software update

773
00:32:09,309 --> 00:32:11,399
delivered an attack and could

774
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:13,990
interconnect to other networks,

775
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:16,299
hopefully I hope that

776
00:32:16,299 --> 00:32:18,130


777
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:20,230
a third risk

778
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,120
within  The supply chain is the

779
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,090
distribution, that is, those who

780
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:27,399
get into the distribution of the

781
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:29,289
application or the distribution of

782
00:32:29,289 --> 00:32:31,330
hardware or software to be able to generate

783
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:35,080
this type of infections or introduce malware

784
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,630
at this point and here we also have

785
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,970
companies

786
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:40,470
and detection, for example in  the

787
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:43,770
international case of microsoft software solutions

788
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:46,440
that had detections or

789
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,210
software that were linked  to the two

790
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:49,650
forms Microsoft that came with other

791
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:52,740
attached malware that we do not count on

792
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,780
and when I made the fixes I detected the

793
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,370
fourth risk is in the acquisition and

794
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:57,780
deployment, that is, I was talking about

795
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,970
when I already massively installed this

796
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:01,289
type of software or when I installed

797
00:33:01,289 --> 00:33:02,669
software that  They are relatively

798
00:33:02,669 --> 00:33:06,809
trustworthy and it comes with

799
00:33:06,809 --> 00:33:08,460
complementary annexes that generate this type

800
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,230
of case for me and a well-known international example that is

801
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,630
very questioned is also that

802
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,789
of folders and as the US government

803
00:33:14,789 --> 00:33:16,919
of text within the

804
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:18,450
folder distribution and updating them

805
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:23,070
certain  infections or

806
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,900
neighboring software artifacts that were attached to the

807
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,159
normal intervention

808
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:27,840
a fifth risk is not less

809
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,280
maintenance, that is when we talk

810
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,750
about software maintenance or when we talk

811
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,330
about hardware maintenance and what

812
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:35,280
we are actually

813
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,679
receiving and here we fully

814
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,929
trust our chains and  in our

815
00:33:39,929 --> 00:33:41,130
supply chain and in our supplier

816
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:44,290
recently  We last week

817
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,880
with a well-known Chilean company and

818
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,950
Saint who is our filmmaker

819
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,690
with the update of the signature and

820
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,640
spent half an hour updating our

821
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,800
platform and we really have an idea

822
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,950
that he installed we fully trust the

823
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:00,280
same thing happens with government platforms of the

824
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,310
headquarters fic  of the hacienda software

825
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:06,790
or unique key or the signature ordes express

826
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:09,370
there is a confidence that we do not

827
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:11,380
really know without a bad intention

828
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,750
obviously we do not know if it is safe or

829
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:16,480
not secure in our update a

830
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,080
sixth risk and the last one is that it is not

831
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,750
less is the  garbage exposure, which is the

832
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:25,150
ability we have to make our

833
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,800
artifacts obsolete our servers

834
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,260
our mobile devices our

835
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,090
workstations

836
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:33,790
effectively eliminated today the amount of equipment

837
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,440
or the speed with which we are renewing

838
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,918
our disks or the migration to the cloud

839
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:40,630
and leaving our platform obsolete

840
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:43,270
we are not capable  to eliminate this type

841
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:45,639
of artifact and it is already demonstrating

842
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,739
As they have done in some cases,

843
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:49,810
collecting sensitive information on

844
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:51,429
this computer and on these workstations,

845
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:53,320
if there is a clear example in

846
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,389
which an American recovered

847
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:58,150
information from 85 average devices,

848
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:00,460
only 5 had deleted information and that

849
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:03,100
still shows that much more  90% of

850
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,660
the computers are not simply

851
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,700
erased and we obviously make

852
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,910
the same mistake now to detect,

853
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:12,250
assuming this type of risk, there are these

854
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,500
types of techniques that are used first, they

855
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,840
have to be a hacker or attacker

856
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,360
, high-level forgiveness here is not a

857
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,070
Denial of services is not

858
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:23,890
an activism against some

859
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:26,410
social issue or any political issue but is

860
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:28,960
a real attacker who has

861
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,790
knowledge and who has patience above all,

862
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:33,760
here you have to plan these

863
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,580
attacks you have to enter the network or

864
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,650
enter the  systems wait to be patient and

865
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:40,420
then generate the respective

866
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,740
malware distributions and

867
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,930
respective attack since the level of d  e that we are

868
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:46,360
talking about this type of attackers is

869
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,820
high and it is dangerous because when

870
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,980
we are receiving this type of attacks

871
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,720
in the government where we know that we still

872
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,790
lack

873
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,710
structure the subject of knowledge on

874
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,360
the issue of cybersecurity deployment, it

875
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,900
is dangerous to face this type of

876
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,920
vulnerabilities and this type of attacker

877
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,100
as they do with three techniques first

878
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,530
is the hijacking of updates

879
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:09,150
then it is the code signing attack and

880
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,670
the third way is to compromise the

881
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,320
open source code when we talk

882
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,110
about hijacking is to join the process

883
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,000
of an update and  Through the

884
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,100
update process, being able to enter and be

885
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,610
able to generate this unwanted income to

886
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:25,560
the network when we talk about an attack on

887
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:29,040
code signing is without pretending to be an

888
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,590
installer or pretending to be an

889
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,690
update trusted source and when

890
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:35,520
we talk about compromising open source code it

891
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,250
is  be inside the

892
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,810
update processes be inside the

893
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:42,030
software and I update  zo and there comes the

894
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:45,120
point when I am a

895
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,190
public institution or I am a private one that delivered

896
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,960
a service that delivered an apps to

897
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,030
the public service or that delivered a

898
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,890
web page that generates and generates

899
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:55,590
cook traffic and key exchange with

900
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,780
a common citizen  I am being

901
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,180
aware of the risk,

902
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,520
I am making sure that my software

903
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,990
that was made to me by a provider that was

904
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,730
made by a third party has a good

905
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:07,550
capacity and that it does not deliver a signature or

906
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,800
that it does not give undue access to that

907
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,589
user who is connecting today we

908
00:37:12,589 --> 00:37:14,420
owe it  Recognizing today is a variable

909
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,859
that from a security point of view

910
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,770
we are not considering it we

911
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:20,020
consider ensuring our platform we

912
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:23,000
consider ensuring income but we

913
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,369
are not seeing the part of how I

914
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:27,559
deliver this update or this

915
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:29,839
connection to the citizen and there is the

916
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,849
risk and  that it is a new risk is a

917
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:34,490
dangerous risk and highly difficult to

918
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:37,309
detect recommendations

919
00:37:37,309 --> 00:37:38,930
the first is and right now

920
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:40,520
especially the  public sector which is

921
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,109
then in the budget evaluation stage

922
00:37:42,109 --> 00:37:44,720
and to ask for the

923
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,150
respective amounts in monetary matters, here we

924
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,740
cannot talk about continuing to talk about

925
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:51,020
digital transformation if there is no

926
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,510
security, we cannot ask to comply with

927
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,430
the tolls comply with the

928
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:57,380
digital transformation indicators if

929
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,210
not  There is a fund or there are no resources to

930
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,339
talk about cybersecurity and that is a very

931
00:38:01,339 --> 00:38:03,950
complicated difficult topic,

932
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,670
we offer ourselves to support those

933
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:09,089
who carry out this crusade to create

934
00:38:09,089 --> 00:38:10,260
more resources

935
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,510
in a difficult budget year but it is

936
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:15,180
something extremely necessary.  number

937
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,339
2 has to do with having

938
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:19,380
security policies that link these relationships

939
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,240
with suppliers, updating it

940
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,520
generally we have them very old and

941
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,260
since the png is not there we have not been

942
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,730
renewing them much and something we renew them

943
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:28,950
some institutions with telework

944
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:31,170
but we must consider the  relationship

945
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:33,510
with suppliers and my policies are

946
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,190
hard on me too  n They have to be

947
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:37,770
harsh with the providers, the second

948
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:39,359
point is to address security within the

949
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,579
agreement, that is, in the design in the

950
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:44,280
development of the applications or the

951
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,200
sites or the link, there must

952
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,380
be agreements and issues that ensure

953
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,690
security issues

954
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:53,250
from the  cybersecurity point of view

955
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,290
not one from the

956
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:58,200
functional or power or code point of view

957
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,270
and the third has to do with the

958
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:02,760
supply chain that is to say that

959
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,190
the contract regulation is written in agreement,

960
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:07,770
the pros and cons of

961
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:10,140
the  risk of these issues a fourth point

962
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,299
has to do with monitoring and

963
00:39:12,299 --> 00:39:12,690
review

964
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:15,869
because it is super difficult today hopefully

965
00:39:15,869 --> 00:39:18,089
the connections or the web services

966
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:20,700
work, hopefully it's my turn to

967
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,230
put a candle to the web to serve the

968
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,319
civil registry but we must make sure

969
00:39:24,319 --> 00:39:26,340
that

970
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,080
We cannot blindly trust this

971
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,580
we have to make sure that this traffic

972
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:32,430
is reviewed or the

973
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:34,830
connections or the interconnection mesh

974
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,660
that we as inst  We are doing it publicly or

975
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,420
as a private sector,

976
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,940
we cannot blindly

977
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:43,020
trust our connection with other

978
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,060
providers, it is necessary to impress the

979
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,890
traffic not only to ensure the

980
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:48,150
front part of the internet but also

981
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,280
our internal connections and the fifth

982
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,870
and last point has to do with the

983
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:52,890
administration.  of the changes of

984
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,050
services that is to say to manage the

985
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:56,700
changes the provision of services on the

986
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,200
part of the providers maintain

987
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,790
maintenance and improve the policies

988
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:01,680
of security of the information and the one

989
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,840
that must be key at this point these

990
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,810
changes must be applied

991
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:09,060
within our of our  goal or

992
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,560
our normal security work

993
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,900
because it is quite complex we are

994
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,180
exposing not only our

995
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,890
structure but also the

996
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:19,290
common citizen of possible risk through this

997
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:21,670
type of attacks

998
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:25,359
finally just thank for this

999
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:28,630
time your first time we carry out

1000
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,490
this event so I appreciate the time

1001
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:33,099
dedication to the team of 8.  8

1002
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:35,020
these are the first is that this event

1003
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:38,170
is hopefully of a very good quality and that it

1004
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:40,210
is quite useful for the public sector

1005
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:41,230


1006
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,849
I thank Gabriel and his team

1007
00:40:42,849 --> 00:40:44,530
I thank Kateryna Canal, she is our

1008
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:46,720
director, that is, she makes possible

1009
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,190

first kick so that it can

1037
00:42:02,059 --> 00:42:04,039
continue in time.  It seems

1038
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:06,170
wonderful that the government is

1039
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:07,940
aware of the relevance of

1040
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,799
cybersecurity for us in 8.8 that

1041
00:42:09,799 --> 00:42:11,359
is too good a sign of the future
