so many wonderful events, some

9
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,079
that  I will comment below because

10
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,960
May brings many surprises we have

20
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,320
I mentioned May is full of

21
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,640
activities by our

22
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,670
community the next workshop is the

23
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,229
next workshop we have is ethics

26, 27 and 28 in three days and 24

26
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:27,290
days so that deep down they catch

27
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,899
up with him  Ethics hacking and

28
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:31,940
we also have another workshop

29
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,910
on adversary desktop windows and adversary tactics or

30
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,649
adversary tactics and it

31
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:39,289
is also Javier Al Tunnel and Diego Bruno

32
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:41,479
Obviously all this information and the

33
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:43,820
values and registration are

34
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,399
available on our website www

35
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,840
828 punto  org next we have more

36
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,479
conference continues this 8.8 government

37
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:56,569
that has raised quite

38
00:01:56,569 --> 00:01:58,039
remarkable comments on the internet thank you very much for

39
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,479
the support of all connected many

40
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,979
thanks to the community that is

41
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:02,630
commenting that you are participating together

42
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:02,780
with

43
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,670
until we can see now on the

44
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,700
screen then we have a  A

45
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,390
representative of the being of Israel who at

46
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,920
this moment as you can understand is

47
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,380
quite busy because however he

48
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,610
had the time to send us a

49
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,290
presentation which we will see

50
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,090
below and it is called current threats,

51
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,700
remember after this and

52
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,290
as it was programmed by

53
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,680
time difference unfortunately we will not have

54
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,690
questions but if any  no doubt you want to

55
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:30,950
see material again you can

56
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,239
find it on our youtube channel

57
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,959
where 828 where you can see from

58
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:38,060
Monday to Tuesday possibly all

59
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,830
these conferences separately and so

60
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,840
that they can finalize sharing and

61
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,540
commenting on your part

62
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,310
then we are left with

63
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,959
the representative of the being of israel

64
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,670
current threats is called this

65
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,709
presentation and you are seeing

66
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:56,230
through peace line is doing 8.8 government

67
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,810
greetings to all before introducing

68
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,520


69
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:06,040
myself i want to thank the hosts ministries of chile and the cr7 the team

70
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,800
of chile for that  they were recounting the

71
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,470
experience we used to

72
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,490
confront the threat of marijuana muddy waters

73
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,110
but first I am going to introduce myself I am

74
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:21,550
I hub I am an officer of the

75
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,460
intelligence forces of the headquarters of the

76
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,340
Israeli defense forces now I work for

77
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,150
dips as an officer of  intelligence

78
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,040
we are going to establish the time frame at the

79
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,050
end of 2020

80
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,750
knowing September October we had

81
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,710
a wave of attacks an offensive campaign

82
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:47,350
against a series of companies in the

83
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,780
work area of israel

84
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,280
these headquarters we had a campaign of sea

85
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,950
and water water are things that turned out to be

86
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,790
that this solution was correct i will

87
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:05,740
try to explain what happened

88
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,989
how  carried out the attack and I hope you

89
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:09,630
can

90
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,480
take some key elements of this

91
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,430
presentation to implement the

92
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,050
most appropriate defenses in your

93
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,160
workplaces or at least

94
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,120
establish

95
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,269
procedures that we should preventive

96
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:34,710
and the attacker achieved

97
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,720
and I think it was a great goal that

98
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,430
established to enter the large

99
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:44,130
number of multiple companies so many

100
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:48,900
companies in this campaign are different and

101
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,380
very capacity very very versatile in their

102
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,450
capacities

103
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:59,100
with sectors behaviors in the

104
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,940
actions taken to hide what

105
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,739


106
00:05:04,739 --> 00:05:08,559
the attacker did then wanted the

107
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:10,539
campaign to be carried out without  being

108
00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:13,049
discovered we are talking about an

109
00:05:13,049 --> 00:05:16,869
attacker a highly motivated

110
00:05:16,869 --> 00:05:22,479
action-wise persistence where obs  erv

111
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:27,519
an attacker somehow managed to

112
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:30,929
return or try to enter where he had

113
00:05:30,929 --> 00:05:36,029
cleaned his intervention was highly

114
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:39,849
motivated and there are multiple

115
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:43,329
attack vectors showing many capacities for

116
00:05:43,329 --> 00:05:44,960
this

117
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:52,460
it is about following the metrics of the

118
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,849
attack procedure we share with

119
00:05:55,849 --> 00:06:00,500
his initial access we saw that  this actor

120
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,069
managed to use public applications

121
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:06,580


122
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:11,349
james exchange servers applications apps

123
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:14,419
everything that can be visualized

124
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:16,849
outside the company networks and that

125
00:06:16,849 --> 00:06:19,900
could lead to some kind of excess

126
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,590
then we saw that this actor

127
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,910
took advantage of the most

128
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,250
vulnerable applications thing is the vulnerabilities

129
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:34,820
we can  see that the cb of 2018 on 13

130
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:40,190
30 59 for example this reality

131
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:46,250
allows the attacker to see reserved files

132
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,110
within this execution without being

133
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,690
authenticated this specific example

134
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:56,479
that can see the files for example

135
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:02,599
of the users the keys allowed

136
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:05,900
by the vpn connection  and if a good

137
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,289
session in this case did not apply some tip

138
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:12,650
or protection for this application or

139
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:19,150
for this one, it may imply access to

140
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:22,210
another of the vulnerabilities

141
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,880
specifically allowed

142
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,900
the attacker to quickly

143
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,510
put this company at risk and I will explain

144
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:36,760
why it is called seve from 2000 2006 88 s is

145
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,570
a vulnerability of  intel

146
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:44,380
exchange exchange I am going to explain you a little in

147
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,130
a general way, you can find out

148
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:50,170
more details but what you do need to

149
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:54,610
know is that once you can access it, it

150
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,210
is easy, it is not highly complex, not

151
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:01,500
a good idea, it requires a lot of

152
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,080
work once it is  use and develop

153
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,620
the request to the server the result of

154
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,920
this solution can be

155
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,250
arbitrary file rights and access to

156
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,940
execute actions within the

157
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,130
server but and receive an

158
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:24,300
authentication in the easy

159
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,860
and is delivered as a package of part of the

160
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,110
access that gives this vulnerability  but

161
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,620
what is special about these is tsb is not

162
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:39,750
only that a special right or attributes are achieved

163
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,729
for access to the

164
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,250
files but that  in the context it is done

165
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,200
within the contexts of the system

166
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,930
in system and this is because the

167
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,230
process

168
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:57,180
takes the request that is forged

169
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,970
and a process of

170
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,460
options that the exchange server or

171
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,750
the service server is tracked in

172
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:11,280
either case  Let's say you enter the context

173
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,430
that is very strong, robust and easy to use

174
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,470
to use the vulnerability and the

175
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,360
attacker and about a very good job of

176
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,209
doing it and scaling it in turn then

177
00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:29,350
part of what you are going to see

178
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,509
and in the list is also the use of

179
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:35,779
open source tools to our

180
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:40,189
attacker not only this in

181
00:09:40,189 --> 00:09:44,539
the network framework I use a series of

182
00:09:44,539 --> 00:09:50,269
vpn servers and I try to do the complex thing of

183
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:54,679
attributing the origin of the attacker and who

184
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:58,839
had accessed but also used their websites

185
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:02,329
in frameworks of the networks that are  very

186
00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:03,139
popular

187
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:08,479
let's say I can say it was difficult to

188
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:11,509
attribute or identify who the attacker

189
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:14,029
was or who has attributed the

190
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:17,859
attacks another important element to

191
00:10:17,859 --> 00:10:20,929
mention is that these vulnerabilities  abilities

192
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:24,129
and even the most severe

193
00:10:24,169 --> 00:10:26,829
once it

194
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,740
announces or the company that advertises that

195
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,350
there is a certain culture is something from

196
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:38,990
hours to day until there is another work

197
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:45,230
on how to exceed what

198
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,410
the fund allows to scale the use of

199
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,520
how these publications work  allow

200
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,810
that perhaps that seems like

201
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,630
something else when it comes to integrating

202
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:05,290
information but they tend to forget that

203
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:09,070
the other side, the offensive side, is going to take

204
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:14,290
those same high-level

205
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:17,920
information or information and specifically the more

206
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,890
sophisticated ones are going to take the

207
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:24,010
explanatory information to use it and  apply it so

208
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,930
it is important to note that and we are going to

209
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,570
talk more about the initial attacks

210
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:31,620
because not only the attacker used

211
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:38,590
information but also more

212
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:43,050
specific methods in places where he could not

213
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:46,930
apply or in some way put at

214
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:50,520
risk screens for example

215
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,520
import and social engineering without

216
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,050
these  they know quite well

217
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:02,680
associated malicious attacks well what is

218
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,839
special about this case is that it conti  go with

219
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:13,060
a more complex impersonation social ingenuity

220
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,490


221
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,160
took documents when you get

222
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,500
access to battery and use these documents as in

223
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,980
some way to dissuade or with

224
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,160
different companies when they wanted me to

225
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,790
come to the

226
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:34,270
Hebrew emails and

227
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,540
these information used as decoys are very good

228
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,390
[Music]

229
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:43,600
maybe we can see an example here of

230
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,089
some of the attachments that he made and these

231
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:50,650
attachments were of course traps

232
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:53,520
and had malicious code

233
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,920
as part of the attachment

234
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,139
this is one of them one of these

235
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:01,860
examples also this technique to

236
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,550
arrest specific victims or

237
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:09,229
computers  It is possible to product

238
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:18,209
the gap and what these elements achieved

239
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,000
to the emails even if they

240
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,459
had not managed to associate some

241
00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:27,069
malicious program high of aimed if they received

242
00:13:27,069 --> 00:13:29,589
notification on a server that was not their

243
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:32,350
own then they could not contribute and

244
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,139
even the server used these tokens

245
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:39,930
or these  generated these items to

246
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:43,620
catch or fool a bit as bait

247
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:48,790
for better  To understand the procedure and they

248
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,699
are methods, let's say that easily

249
00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:55,449
people fell down and agreed now a little more

250
00:13:55,449 --> 00:13:57,759
about the execution, I want to talk or not

251
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:01,870
because you have to be aware

252
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,269
of every detail you know my work but

253
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:08,079
because you have to understand what the

254
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,449
current organization is like  current

255
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,600
organization networks can be used

256
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,870
without external tools the

257
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,980
only attacker called bengoa is very common

258
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,520
indicates

259
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:31,300
the extraction each house is in this

260
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:36,790
technique and the sensors protecting the

261
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,190
networks we can use tool source

262
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,310
or are notified of it is a type

263
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,160
of attack  or execution that allows us not

264
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,500
only to know how to capture

265
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,760


266
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,000
someone's intruder outside feeding but

267
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,740
also once it is inside at the

268
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:58,120
time they need to make life and work

269
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,920
difficult there are many methods of doing this

270
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,410
but let's talk a little about what

271
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:12,550
this did  version although it is very very

272
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,690
powerful attackers when they use it

273
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:19,650
to download files from servers and

274
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:23,490
lead to use co  specific controls

275
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:27,510
that want to execute the system specific code to

276
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,620
search and also for

277
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,080
easy authentication to do so within

278
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,310
graus or because it is incorporated in

279
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,440
the system casing are within the framework

280
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,510
and it is very important at home at this

281
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,470
point and I think there are a number of

282
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:49,800
elements that  the defense team can

283
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,790
do

284
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:55,700
to block or minimize the

285
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:03,720
malicious use of which we talked

286
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,940
about registering remote tasks of remote services

287
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,250
and that is something that they can

288
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:18,590
monitor and of the specific call

289
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:25,339
but they are not difficult to carry out these

290
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:31,620
writings are not not  they are very very noisy

291
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,570
but it is easy to understand when someone

292
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,430
is trying to execute a

293
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:38,040
malicious code and how they move within

294
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,529
the snipe functions

295
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:43,529
we have to focus then on the

296
00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:46,829
televisions the protections and observe

297
00:16:46,829 --> 00:16:49,560
this and you could also see here on the

298
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,690
left

299
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:54,209
this image part of the  registry

300
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:56,760
defender

301
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,860
built-in windows built-in mechanism that almost all

302
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,890
new verse  Windows version is

303
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:05,390
installed in the world it will include

304
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:10,060
it can really help to understand

305
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,880
when it is an entity some

306
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,310
aspect of an attacker for example here

307
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:22,690
the windows defender could explain the

308
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:25,540
search that the attacker did to

309
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,000
access certain files in this case

310
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,760
Then frames were heard where the

311
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,000
elements of the network were,

312
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,400
here the links we can see it trying

313
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,700
[Music]

314
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,900
on the server so it could have been

315
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,700
accessed from outside and we activated

316
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,830
persistence in the search for

317
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,860
information and in this sense the built-

318
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,860
in projection system was able to achieve  8

319
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:57,929
perform it and register it

320
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,930
from a games function that was

321
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:04,690
under things also from another and with

322
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:06,870
this mechanism it could be identified

323
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:10,930
because it was activated then here what

324
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:13,120
they do is they activate it

325
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,390
and now they activate it again but it is

326
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:18,550
possible to capture it because there are tasks that

327
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:22,450
whether reus are recurrent in attack

328
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:26,350
the attacker implements a

329
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,649


330
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,070
malicious task with a task name to execute  a

331
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,680
malicious code and we can talk a

332
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,480
little more in front of yellow version

333
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,110
of the port they end television

334
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:41,510
then

335
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:44,210
we are going to press natural persistence

336
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:47,300
when once we can

337
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:51,190
carry out execute the code

338
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:55,440
and have little footing within the network what

339
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,289
we want to do is  make sure that the

340
00:18:58,289 --> 00:19:02,779
entry is present in the network

341
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:10,220
in effect and have a

342
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,989
persistent participation within the network that was

343
00:19:12,989 --> 00:19:15,720
accessed illegally

344
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,379
we can see with certain tools or

345
00:19:19,379 --> 00:19:25,950
writings I am going to say that they are frames

346
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,979
that can change the names but it is

347
00:19:28,979 --> 00:19:32,070
important to know  that this assailant

348
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,840
had his own series of

349
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,460
tools that he himself

350
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,020
is not very common for

351
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,110
the malicious program but a trend

352
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:48,760
that is being seen recently but

353
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,520
it is also important to

354
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,860
know the attacker to know the

355
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,840
tools that he is doing then he

356
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,360
has  that being

357
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:03,600


358
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:09,310
the information of the texts and the

359
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,680
sequence of data and commands and sources is being investigated

360
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:17,770
that they generally use when it comes to

361
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:21,850
launching a windows application looks for

362
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:26,530
the sources of repositories that have

363
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,590
specific application codes if they

364
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,570
have certain functions to operate

365
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:36,190
those are mainly from ls when

366
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,400
we are talking about research

367
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,740
rights windows has certain

368
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,830
minimum mechanisms of how a

369
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:47,860
program search the repositories for

370
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:51,240
the sequence and hackers can

371
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,640
manipulate this technique this process and

372
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,770
make legitimate applications

373
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,629
and load them into memory and thus execute

374
00:21:04,629 --> 00:21:07,330
malicious code what did in this

375
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:10,409
case of attackers take in the

376
00:21:10,409 --> 00:21:12,789
legitimate updates of some

377
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:17,169
versions and that  generating this

378
00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:20,590
vulnerability and we are also

379
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:24,849
making a parallel version and what it

380
00:21:24,849 --> 00:21:28,599
did is incorporated in a folder with

381
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:32,309
names with program data,

382
00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:35,379
finally, it is to execute the application

383
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:40,690
to load it is the malicious one, proscribed

384
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,539
and encoded by it and also

385
00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:46,389
achieve persistence within the  of

386
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:50,429
these systems achieving e  executing the

387
00:21:50,429 --> 00:21:52,690
google update again was

388
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:58,419
legitimate and it finally managed to execute its

389
00:21:58,419 --> 00:22:02,129
code later

390
00:22:02,729 --> 00:22:06,489
pl to operate it this technique

391
00:22:06,489 --> 00:22:11,889
can also be used in real-time applications

392
00:22:11,889 --> 00:22:13,169


393
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:17,769
and they do not necessarily require an

394
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:22,950
execution from

395
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:33,369
and we can see how to speak

396
00:22:33,369 --> 00:22:40,659
these elements in real time in the victim  It is not

397
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:45,039
necessarily a sophisticated process

398
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,769
or with reflection but it is a very good

399
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:53,049
example of how to run a

400
00:22:53,049 --> 00:22:55,629
third application which in this case may be

401
00:22:55,629 --> 00:23:00,570
useful for you that is in terms of persistence

402
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:06,000
obviously webs it is used as

403
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,899
all continuity methods

404
00:23:10,899 --> 00:23:14,830
when incorporating registering and carrying

405
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:20,110
out multiple web shows and files and

406
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,940
do being careful that even if someone

407
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:25,510
in a persistence gets lost maybe

408
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:28,179
this is what he had for the active user

409
00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:31,059
or review defense systems he wanted to

410
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:37,080
make sure the soul remained and

411
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,940
what kept the resistance within

412
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:43,630
him  the host system the following

413
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:50,350
would be achieved what it wanted from the pea

414
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:54,060
alike and manages to

415
00:23:54,060 --> 00:24:00,240
continue on the servers he also managed to

416
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,230
access and also have access to

417
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:09,430
the credentials and using these

418
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:15,240
science in external resources that are not

419
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:29,680
what it is to extract information in

420
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,530
large packages by downloading to be able to

421
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:43,020
later filter the tools for

422
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:49,360
system functions  but these

423
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,380
tools can be identified

424
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:56,040
by any

425
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:59,770
defender of systems in the networks but

426
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:04,290
it can also enable authentication

427
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:10,120
is a method that microsoft put or

428
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:15,070
incorporates windows basically in part

429
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:17,550
this verification

430
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:21,000
in windows machines was

431
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,360
saved as text

432
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:30,710
access texts but still being able to give it  The

433
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:36,680
option of the system before using these

434
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:41,680
keys, then what

435
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:49,820
had to be deactivated this

436
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:53,510
specific access value to this new version and

437
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,080
that in some servers managed to enter

438
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:03,639
deactivate this custom registry

439
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:16,460
in a specific location and if the

440
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:20,030
attacker managed to access again  los to

441
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:24,560
credentials tools  While iu and

442
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,230
incorporating new keys to the system

443
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:29,890
for its identification

444
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,630
also in it

445
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:43,110
is to identify in server accounts

446
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:47,790
any information that was more

447
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:50,890
associated with the excesses and through

448
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:53,590
legitimate tools of the fed is that

449
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:58,030
then the facia goes with a talent that the

450
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:00,520
same  creator lamas filtered to

451
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:05,860
access even more credentials

452
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,090
of the network jobs in the networks

453
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,429
the next thing I am going to comment is

454
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:15,039
evasion and the defense worked hard

455
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,039


456
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:22,830
for persistence and for that it has to

457
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:29,910
be very has to be persistent in the

458
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:35,760
design of  the attractions and the method was

459
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,460
in the execution of code was the

460
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:45,690
next and in some way to execute

461
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:49,200
towards the attacker uniform or to deceive

462
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:55,110
the users the one of the 32 suburb is

463
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:58,590
a legitimate component of windows but

464
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:04,020
it could be used to execute the malicious code

465
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,510


466
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,140
[  Music]

467
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,150
then once I want to use a

468
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:13,460
code it can be under the

469
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:20,870
32 context also with an execution or with a

470
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:23,169
proxy code

471
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:29,720
is a fo  rma of at least would

472
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:41,870
allow us a code is reviewed that is

473
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:44,480
trying to execute this code could

474
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,779
perfectly use this also associated

475
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:51,289
this theme hiding or hiding a

476
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:54,830
specific artifact artist is

477
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:59,649
what this attacker tried to use a lot to

478
00:28:59,649 --> 00:29:04,770
work in scopes of records

479
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:09,429
using  filenames as

480
00:29:09,429 --> 00:29:12,880
proper names of the network duplicating some

481
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,179
duplicate files using

482
00:29:16,179 --> 00:29:19,830
as many files or

483
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:22,750
legitimate folders within systems hiding their

484
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,850
code

485
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:28,090
we have seen doing

486
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:31,840
this at different points also

487
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,230
decoding files trying to

488
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:39,590
stay hidden within the

489
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:43,820
proprietary systems thus evading  Let's

490
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:49,150
say defense systems also so that what he did he

491
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:51,890
tried to do as much as possible for the

492
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,679
files of the file system he knew

493
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:58,039
that he was in the process or they were

494
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:03,289
housed in specific places then he

495
00:30:03,289 --> 00:30:05,600
began to create the information with his

496
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,559
own code he used as much as possible  from the

497
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:14,419
same system also using systems  from the

498
00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:18,230
internet and tried to download the

499
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:20,450
maximum possible files but

500
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:25,340
through the external verses so that

501
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:30,720
and it will imply less or less runs to

502
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,960
the accesses only then surplus so

503
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,890
it also tried to access these

504
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:40,320
files in their own environment not within

505
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,320
the  system attacked with lateral movements

506
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,280
obviously the goal of speaking

507
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:56,010
before when it promises a network and the option

508
00:30:56,010 --> 00:31:01,879
for always

509
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,160
the servers in the first in the

510
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,710
first time the first attempt is something

511
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:13,980
that is accessed little by little which

512
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:19,410
then did various commands to

513
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,809
separate

514
00:31:20,809 --> 00:31:27,669
hundreds commands and codes and managed to

515
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:33,340
connect to certain

516
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:37,789
code servers and the fields of servers and

517
00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:44,259
stations of the networks also use

518
00:31:49,539 --> 00:31:55,179
to send commands and tasks

519
00:31:56,019 --> 00:32:00,999
within a specific segment

520
00:32:01,549 --> 00:32:08,049
was not sitting so carefully

521
00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:12,320
options to establish a connection to

522
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:18,490
different servers of a remote

523
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:25,130
also in which part of the

524
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:31,040
windows management system is it known is

525
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:36,370
you strong against u  n operator of the field of

526
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:39,800
tea and thank you many people I work

527
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,380
where you can make connections to search

528
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:47,060
part of the neighbor and update and see

529
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:49,100
selected aspect of the networks but

530
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,820
what an attacker does is access

531
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,460
this way of communicating

532
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:59,800
and you leverage it and you use this  method

533
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,320
can write or code certain

534
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,520
tasks for execution to also

535
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,370
always write code or

536
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:14,920
execution commands and it is a very complex tool

537
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,020


538
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,130
[Music]

539
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:22,070
in a windows environment and we have seen

540
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:24,200
that attackers use it several times

541
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,020
several times your friend here managed

542
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:32,510
use it quite a bit for

543
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,910
lateral transfer movements here we see an

544
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:38,360
example of this mechanism

545
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:48,850
using double m than a

546
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:55,190
windows management command that tries to connect

547
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:57,850
to a node within the

548
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:01,790
lenin network using a specific user that

549
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:04,700
in this case was related to  a

550
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:09,949
service to a sql server with the

551
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:13,820
established key and with the execution of creating

552
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,830
a process

553
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:18,429
in this case if it is executed  I used with

554
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:20,530
certainty that

555
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:25,000
files by walking around certain files

556
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,370
that is called in this case

557
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:31,449
all ps1 and this file was captured

558
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:34,239
from a certain station and is used

559
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:38,739
to communicate with a c2 server that

560
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:41,530
was obviously the attacker that contained

561
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:46,449
codes that he wanted to execute from this

562
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:52,469
form we can issue this command

563
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:55,360
this command sequence is now put

564
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:59,200
more entertaining previously we have

565
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,370
a series of tools that

566
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:07,650
are freely available in the

567
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:17,040
case of reverting,

568
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:22,030
reverting

569
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,970
to a level of complexity or as you write,

570
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:29,810
the codes were also

571
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:34,060
raised because we have seen

572
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:39,200
taking control  It is very them in the

573
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,869
way they were established but

574
00:35:41,869 --> 00:35:43,910
we were able to identify it here, what I

575
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:46,940
think is one of the

576
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:51,140
sources of their actions and let's talk a

577
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,730
little about the command and

578
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:54,950
control functions and we have seen that our

579
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:57,849
disposition used tools in the remote

580
00:35:57,849 --> 00:36:05,710
I was mainly in that service in

581
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:09,940
areas that are not so common

582
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:17,170
we can  distinguish some tools

583
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:20,090
when someone from the special area does it

584
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,080


585
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,090
and we also believe that this was the law of

586
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:25,640
work in the trot cante we also use

587
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:30,920
a series of vpn services including knots

588
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,220
and felix in services or hosting all over

589
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:38,480
the world but it is like going back to

590
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,870
more difficult to attribute the actions to the

591
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:44,080
attacker

592
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,490
we usually see that they go to one or two

593
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:50,990
hosting services sometimes you may believe

594
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:53,690
creating the instigation but here you actually

595
00:36:53,690 --> 00:37:01,660
used several services it

596
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:09,580
is difficult to be able to point to a

597
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:13,830
let's say responsible if we can

598
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:18,360
identify that it was also worth it

599
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:25,080
comment that he used specific for an

600
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:30,030
objective goal when he wanted to create a

601
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:35,370
channel 2 he used a specific provider or

602
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:40,560
a specific service that was an

603
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,540
equivalent to the type of service or the bmn

604
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,410
according to the hosting

605
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:49,170
therefore let's say that he divided his

606
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:52,260
assets and tools through  of

607
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,600
the various objectives and we saw that it

608
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,140
had was quite neat in that and

609
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,710
this also want it to be

610
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:04,190
proto  colos of 2

611
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:07,460
albert

612
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:10,140
or indicate that this server is a

613
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:14,489
service 2 we would also see

614
00:38:14,489 --> 00:38:17,519
certain ways of communicating we want

615
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:22,979
then to see something exclusive with the

616
00:38:22,979 --> 00:38:31,969
system that communicates an

617
00:38:31,969 --> 00:38:35,689
open source form of addressing

618
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:40,098
situations that included

619
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:48,959
others is the ability to take a

620
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:51,349
station

621
00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:55,459
and with  that

622
00:38:55,459 --> 00:38:58,160
passing the favor connect to the internet by

623
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,229
connecting to channel c 2 extract the

624
00:39:01,229 --> 00:39:04,710
data with the third party

625
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:12,720
and also because I do not know it would not be so

626
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,240
suspicious when you see the

627
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,320
historical records of the charges of the

628
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,500
protection systems it is good that would be all

629
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,890
thanks to presenting myself  I really hope

630
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:29,990
we have calmer days,

631
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:37,830
teeth like this, my greetings from you and

632
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:40,640
I regret not being able to be in person,

633
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,700
I follow questions, contact and normalization,

634
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,560
if necessary,

635
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:51,740
the receipts could you would love them,

636
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,290
thanks to the participation of the

637
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:01,410
being from Israel, current threats was the

638
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:03,869
talk that we were  just seeing

639
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:06,869
what is going to begin to close this session

640
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:09,690
of 8.8  government a session that for

641
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:10,920
us historical

642
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,230
first because it is the first 88 government

643
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,759
within the agenda that we have in the

644
00:40:14,759 --> 00:40:16,650
year of all the conferences that has

645
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:19,319
8.8 of which can be reported at

646
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:23,549
www 828 dot org check all the

647
00:40:23,549 --> 00:40:24,930
countries in which we participate there  You

648
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:26,249
can also see it, there are the people of Andean

649
00:40:26,249 --> 00:40:28,650
Bolivia, Peru, Mexico, the people of being able to

650
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:30,390
see the transactions of Las Vegas, in short,

651
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:32,490
they will also find there the link

652
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:33,930
to the old material to the old

653
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:35,910
conferences in addition to our link to

654

our social networks

655
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,749
828 where particularly on YouTube

656
00:40:39,749 --> 00:40:42,839
We have everything, everything, everything, everything, everything, all set up

657

so that you can enjoy

658
00:40:45,029 --> 00:40:46,920
each of the talks separately,

courtesy of Cristian, whom we greet and

660
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,730
thank for the contribution he has made to

661
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:53,249
8.8, so you know, he is also in

662
00:40:53,249 --> 00:40:55,109
charge of the half, so every month to

663
00:40:55,109 --> 00:40:56,579
end of the month on the last Friday of each

664
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:59,849
month we meet to talk, talk and

665
00:40:59,849 --> 00:41:01,829
share, give each other synergy with the cases,

666
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:03,539
the knowledge  You and the information that

667
00:41:03,539 --> 00:41:05,789
we have about cybersecurity 8.8

668
00:41:05,789 --> 00:41:07,529
we have for the whole year and

669
00:41:07,529 --> 00:41:09,300
from now on we also have workshops

670
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,040
to which you can register, all of

671
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,780
them take place in May so run to

672
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,670
register notable workshops such as

673
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:17,280
hacking in short and you can  Knowing all this

674
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,600
information and knowing the most

675
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,790
important values that are not very expensive and

676
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:21,870
can be found on our

677
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:24,870
8.8 website, we are also obviously grateful when we

678
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:26,550
say that in an alliance that has been going on for a

679
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:29,940
year now, you have been a participant and the pillar that

680
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,050
has allowed us  carry out this

681
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:32,760
transmission with you to open this

682
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,970
year 2021 our first year within the

683
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:39,030
new decade and the first year of 8.8

684
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,010
also within a decade we will be

685
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:43,050
11 years old so we hope you will

686
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:45,120
join us and continue discovering,

687
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,270
learning and recognizing technology issues

688
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:50,700
and cybersecurity in the world

689
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,730
mundo bueno we have some last

690
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:55,950
words from an authority to close

691
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:59,430
this session of 8.8 government t  We have the

692
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:01,110
words of Juan Francisco Galli, who is

693
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:03,240
the Undersecretary of the Interior who

694
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,250
sent us some comments and a

695
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:07,320
message so that we can see him here at the end

696
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,100
of 88 government, there

697
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,800
is no doubt that we are living in times of

698
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,410
change, particularly in which we have not

699
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:17,350
seen what is coming.  In the

700
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:19,480
future not only as an individual but

701
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,010
also especially public entities

702
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:23,950
that in the global context

703
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:27,030
also join cyberspace,

704
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:29,710
the use of the Internet in our society and

705
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:31,120
particularly now as a result of the

706
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,700
pandemic has expanded

707
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,040
considerably and today in  The public services

708
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,350
in the data is perhaps the

709
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:40,960
most important asset in the state

710
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,400
we have always been behind in the

711
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,870
handling of the files when it was on

712
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:50,020
paper we already had a management that was

713
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:52,600
deficient but today

714
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,790
all the data of the state is added an additional difficulty

715
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:57,760
o almost all the state data

716
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,490
is on computer platforms that

717
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:02,140
are accessible through the

718
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:05,350
terminals  I know that you or I use

719
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:07,870
in the ministry and in that way

720
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:10,600
then we have to be aware that in

721
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,250
addition to being our work instrument,

722
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:14,590
our computer our

723
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:17,650
access to the web is also a

724
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:20,110
gateway or a window for people

725
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:22,990
outside the service to access  to

726
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:25,750
data that is from the state that may

727
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:28,210
include sensitive data of

728
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:30,310
citizens, that is why it is so important that

729
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:32,710
we are aware that our

730
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,560
computer is our work tool,

731
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,980
perhaps

732
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:44,740
the office is at the same time an instrument at the

733
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,570
service of Chileans but it can

734
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:48,820
also be  a risk that is why it is so

735
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:51,040
important that we have to take all

736
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,080
the measures

737
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,210
and our seats and our

738
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:56,950
department of networks and

739
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:59,320
computer security suggest us to take

740
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,350
safeguard measures and thus prevent

741
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:04,790
people outside the service from

742
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:07,370
having access to the information of

743
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:08,920
our services but particularly

744
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,720
that those people have access to

745
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,180
sensitive citizen information  We

746
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:16,790
expect from the state not only security not

747
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:18,860
only protection but also a

748
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,750
correct administration and production of

749
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:22,970
goods I want to thank

750
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:24,860
especially all the public officials who

751
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:27,320
are participating in this conference for the first time

752
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:30,440
8.8 that we do intra-

753
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,450
government for public officials

754
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:35,030
on an issue  which is as relevant as

755
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:37,100
cybersecurity as being prevented and from

756
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,470
attacks and particularly protecting the

757
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:43,540
data of the state but particularly

758
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:46,299
and citizens

759
