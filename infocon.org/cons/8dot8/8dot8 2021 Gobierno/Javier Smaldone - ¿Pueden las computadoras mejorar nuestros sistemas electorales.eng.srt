00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:27,480
and we are back we greet

3
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,039
our sponsors we greet the

4
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,689
people that is to say we greet the people we

5
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:32,490
greet the people who make it possible

6
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,250
to carry out this first event of

7
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,370
8.8 government first date within the

8
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,890
calendar of 8.8 in this conference

9
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,110
that  He has been training for 11 years, educating,

10
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,539
informing about cybersecurity, the

11
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:46,980
following conference is quite

12
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,690
interesting.

13
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,149

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:02,739
Well thank you for your time and thank you

19
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:04,000
for coming and sharing with us on

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,299
this first date of 8.8 government and we

21
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:08,830
thank you precisely for that time also

22
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,840
for the theme that has to do with

23
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,729
electronic voting.

28

and these things apologizing

29
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,050
first because these are things that  They have a

30
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,190
lot if you want with the

31
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,110
constitutional law reading rights and I

32
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,570
am not a lawyer and IT partner

33
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:41,409
and in particular, I apologize because I am a

34
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:42,940
foreigner, I do not know the

35
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,070
particularities of the Chilean electoral system,

36
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,870


37
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,400
despite that I will try to

38
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,710
save you in general on different

39
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,690
systems of readers  the world and

40
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,720
excuse me if I make any

41
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,130
inaccuracies in what specifically applies

42
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,369
to the Chilean system if

43
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:02,420
you do not worry that we understand that

44
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,460
different jurisprudence but we are

45
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,780
interested in knowing the experience we are

46
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,909
interested in knowing the issue behind

47
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:09,590
electronic voting to understand how

48
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,599
vulnerabilities are precisely with what  Which one

49
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,770
you have a lot of experience because

50
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,000
you are a man who experiments with it

51
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,620
and seeks precisely that type of

52
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,870
information. It seems to me that it is time

53
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,450
that I left you the 8.8 Javier government scenario

54
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,850
that you make available to you.

55
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,970
This space is

56
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,900
good, thank

57
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,239
you very much.  idea is to speak in

58
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,050
general

59
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:35,500
and good  Uses or misuses can be

60
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,080
given to computer science in our

61
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,110
selection in the different stages of

62
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,450
the electoral process and I always

63
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,980
like it when I talk about this to give it

64
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,320
a perspective so that a

65
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,450
dimension of the importance of what we

66
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,960
are talking about is taken

67
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,390
with this phrase  of the Spanish philosopher with a

68
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,250
muted being who says that the health of

69
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,570
democracies

70
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,760
whatever their type and degree depends

71
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,740
on a miserable technical dpc the

72
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,450
electoral procedure and that everything

73
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,410
else comes later, this is

74
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,870
secondary while highlighting the

75
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,180
importance of the system  electoral system

76
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,390
and also puts it in focus on

77
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,970
what is

78
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:19,850
a miserable technical class is not something

79
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:23,740
super complex as a system

80
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,140
but being so simple it is at the same time so

81
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,030
important you have to be careful with the

82
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,490
small details so the

83
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:34,480
idea is the heat a bit  it from there

84
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,220
and I also always like to start with

85
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,349
this tweet this phrase from not long

86
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:41,319
ago a year and a half from mcleish for

87
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,840
those who do not know him are  the

88
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,870
organizers with

89
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,650
a guy who has a few decades

90
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:52,410
making systems of different types

91
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,920
and he says this has been studying

92
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,050
computer security professionally

93
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,870
for three decades

94
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,390
and election security

95
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,760
half that time and the integrity of

96
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,340
computer choices or not

97
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,590
is one  one of the most

98
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,269
difficult problems I have encountered and the

99
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:13,549
solution does not go into a hashtag which

100
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:16,418
means it is a difficult problem if

101
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:19,190
many people happen to think that when they

102
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,978
approach this, how can we modernize

103
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:24,080
how we can computerize the

104
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,540
electoral system, they see it as something simple  is to

105
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,600
cast votes and then count votes but

106
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,110
when one begins to go deeper

107
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,030
to see the details they remember that it

108
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,220
really is such a difficult problem that

109
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,350
the dates do not have a solution and

110
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,850
we know that there will never be an

111
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,910
optimal solution to better systems  and worse

112
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,530
but we will never reach the

113
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:49,020
ideal system towards computers or not

114
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,690
with respect to the use of computers for  To

115
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,280
throw away what we colloquially call

116
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,560
electronic voting,

117
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,860
here is the first patent for an

118
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,360
electronic voting device in

119
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,970
the US February 74 47 years in the US

120
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,710
the idea is also that how they are the

121
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,330
same year a few days before this one

122
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,870
and I mean by this  What I want to

123
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,790
show with this is not something new, it is not

124
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,320
something that if it did not happen yesterday

125
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,720
and a very short time ago, it is something that has already been around for

126
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,080
47 years in the United States, which in

127
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,090
turn is the pioneer country in throwing away

128
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,150
machines, everyone together voted from the

129
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,180
end  From the 19th century

130
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,979
they used to vote with machines,

131
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:34,530
first mechanical machines after

132
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,860
electromechanical and finally

133
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,419
computerized, it has a long journey,

134
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:42,139


135
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,850
fully speaking

136
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,580
modern electronic voting systems, let's say from

137
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,570
the 90s onwards, there are at least three

138
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,180
well differentiated types, which are

139
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,370
machines.  direct registration

140
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,260
this is a computer where

141
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,560
freeland voters were in front of that

142
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,140
computer each casts  Your vote and the

143
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,660
machine will record those votes in some type of

144
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,310
memory of the internal storage device

145
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,250
and at the end of the day it

146
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,420
gives us the results

147
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,540


148
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,400


149
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,470


150
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,479
.  With the one that

151
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:26,430
enables a vote to be cast,

152
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,800
the right is instead of a kind

153
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,260
of reserved dark room where the

154
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,810
voter goes

155
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,240
and presses the key that he wants to vote

156
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,520
if the elections in India are

157
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,740
quite simple like that, a single wife

158
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,700
and the  The machine is registering and at the end

159
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,560
of the day it shows in that display that is

160
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,480
above that it looks quite eighty, it

161
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,520
really is the result

162
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,620
I have a little more modern currently

163
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,190
the use also in Brazil

164
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,230
also a similar scheme determined

165
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,880
on the left in which the chairman

166
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,280
table  paramilitary that casts a vote the one

167
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,120
on the right the x the voter

168
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,630
and the vote is cast by pressing clearing the

169
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,230
number of lists

170
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:15,130
and at the end of the day that machine casts  a

171
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,850
ticket with the result of the vote

172
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,710
what is the obvious obvious problem,

173
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,410
and by systems that if someone

174
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,930
manipulates this storage that alters

175
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,690
what is inside the result will

176
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,360
be anything and something a little

177
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,290
finer it is impossible for someone to say this

178
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,270
Our real result and our

179
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:41,110
evidence because the only one who knows the

180
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,750
only one who registered that they voted were cast

181
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,050
is the system itself

182
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,120
and then we have a system of the

183
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,580
systems widely used, especially in

184
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,190
the 90s and early this century in the United States, this

185
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,919
is a joke.  It is a

186
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,479
voting machine that was hacked to run a

187
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:01,310
pacman and to show

188
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,460
and effectively what is stored

189
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,290
in that machine is not reliable at all

190
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,280
and can be manipulated

191
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,400
to save this problem of I have to

192
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,320
trust what the machine tells me it

193
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,650
is  the result was added what is

194
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:22,160
called auditable record on paper

195
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,820
and there a second generation was born, this

196
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,470
for example the same system of India

197
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:31,280
and you  Jan added is that box on the

198
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,729
side

199
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:37,659
an acrylic viewer and that every time

200
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:39,399
a mind a vote out there passes a

201
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:42,159
piece of paper that shows what the voter

202
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,659
vote

203
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,459
of the voter can not touch

204
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:47,230
it, he can only see it a few seconds later it is

205
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,180
cut and falls into  The box below that

206
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:52,360
would serve as the ballot box and the idea is

207
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,459
that at the end of the day I can open

208
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:57,050
this to control

209
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,660
the result of those pieces of paper is

210
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,969
consistent with what the machine registered

211
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,300
the same system that is being added

212
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,890
I do not know if in this  The moment is already

213
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,140
approved but proposed for the

214
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,990
machines in Brazil with the box on the

215
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:17,520
side so that they avoid the ballot,

216
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,640
you cannot think there we know what

217
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,680
we want to make the system better

218
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,740
and what happens instantly is that it

219
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,650
seems to approach the system that

220
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,230
we already use where  we ended up counting

221
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,350
paper balls

222
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,850
and this is the latest trend in fashion

223
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,410
ballot brand devices

224
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,300
here we have an example of some that

225
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,639
have been tested in the usa a

226
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,579
touch screen  where it appears what would be the

227
00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:49,030


228
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:52,300
important ball makes its selection and at the

229
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,300
bottom

230
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,550
the machine ejects a paper printed with

231
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,170
the ballot with the martita that the

232
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,690
voter made and once again it is pressed and

233
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,070
what is the difference with theresa of the

234
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,360
ballots  For example, it says that

235
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,410
the brand in hand enough, well if you can reduce

236
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,750
some type of error, badly made brands

237
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,839
but without doing what we are doing, we are

238
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:17,670
a computer system with the task area

239
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,230
as always as it puts a brand on a

240
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,529
paper

241
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,600
on this side of the continent  On the other

242
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,380
side of the mountain range, here in Argentina

243
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,300
, something very similar to the

244
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,370
ball-marking systems appeared, but with a

245
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,580
technological twist that they called

246
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,170
electronic ballot or single electoral ballot,

247
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:45,130
basically this is a

248
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:47,490
machine

249
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,490
a computer is a touch screen

250
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,380
but it has the  side a slot

251
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,379
to place a ballot

252
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:57,520
here I have one

253
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,310
the mark on one side is blank

254
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:03,550
one inserts the ball automatically

255
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:06,220
the screen is enabled  The voter chooses

256
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,290
what he wants to vote on and when he

257
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,779
confirms

258
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:12,120
the machine swallows the ballot with a

259
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,310
thermal printer it prints

260
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,769
the devotees a lot on this side in white but

261
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:19,499
also it is not possible to see by the light of

262
00:11:19,499 --> 00:11:21,440
that little square

263
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,600
the joke is that the ballot  Inside it has

264
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,990
gestures

265
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:31,010
and the same thing is that the voter

266
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:33,970
votto and appears printed, it should be

267
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:38,440
engraved on that chip

268
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,399
so that it was accepted to later

269
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,699
facilitate the count by passing the chips

270
00:11:43,699 --> 00:11:46,790
through the same machine as if you look at

271
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,510
where that symbolic yellow circle is

272
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,490


273
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:55,130
The same device that records the

274
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,870
referee taxes can also read us the same

275
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:59,209
voting machine if that later to

276
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:01,550
count the votes

277
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:05,320
and what is the magic,

278
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,530
this type of system stands out, let's say,

279
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,810
as the main strength and I

280
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,540
cannot count twice the same August

281
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:16,540
because because  Each refaidy tank has

282
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,840
a supposedly unchangeable unique identifier

283
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,450
and that would

284
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,670
somehow guarantee that no one can count

285
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:27,470
the vote multiple times.

286
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,750
To go into details we can

287
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,210
discuss after a while for

288
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,320
questions and answers

289
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,720
apart from the many vulnerabilities

290
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,279
that this system may have

291
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,560
here in Argentina it was sold to us

292
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,320
and if it continues to sell us, it means that the

293
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,730
machines have no memory and the

294
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,340
machines are machines, but the machines

295
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,140
they are mere printers that we never

296
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,460
print on a piece of paper what the

297
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:55,220
voter said but the reality is that

298
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,550
in a quite complex

299
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,980
system it is a system the main system computer

300
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,880
is based on ubuntu with a

301
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,510
software made in python on top of

302
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,399
that which is  Let's say the application is

303
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:12,640
used to dump and then to count and

304
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,370
basically it is a beautiful computer

305
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:19,839
with a micro were given and with all the

306
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,640
usual devices of

307
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,779
divided readers that the software

308
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,960
is introduced is called the machine is

309
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,540
turned to divide that has the

310
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,140
operating system  and the application

311
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,600
device to be arrogant has to

312
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,680
emit some sound

313
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,279
and connected through it as

314
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:43,250
ad  The usb ispositive has the entire set

315
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:47,950
of the reader-writer, the green transfer

316
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:51,730
and the thermal printer,

317
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,750
the software that runs that

318
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,090
microcontroller, ademyc controls all of them, it

319
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,910
is a set, for example, it is not known,

320
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,770
it was never made public, it could never be

321
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,970
audited, it was never seen

322
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:07,180
a few years ago, a  A variant of

323
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,130
this system that in the place that was used

324
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,110
until now in the democratic republic

325
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:14,920
of the congo in 2018 week I remember and

326
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,600
basically what they did if you

327
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,970
see the appearance is quite similar what

328
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,560
they did was copy the

329
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,170
electronic ballot system of the presidency

330
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,400
replace  the jokes rifai of the

331
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,510
ball for a qr code

332
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,780
this time the vote is still printed with the

333
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,550
names with a photo of the candidates

334
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,770
not in colors as shown on the

335
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,720
screen but in thermal printers in

336
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,579


337
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:41,089
black

338
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,519
and instead of recording the vote in  Last you

339
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,999
refer, the vote is printed in a

340
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:50,420
qr code obviously with the same trick as

341
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,610
there is no identifier here he placed r in

342
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:56,160
addition to the vote  or of the citizen and

343
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,889
the only one is built that would later

344
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:03,259
prevent someone from counting the mod twice,

345
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,110
separated at birth, and the look shows

346
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,750
that they are very similar systems, they

347
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,940
did not even bother to redesign the

348
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,790
ballot,

349
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:18,450
we found other similarities, the company

350
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,690
here alone the abuser system and Congo  It is

351
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,340
a company that had some kind of

352
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,870
negotiation relationship with the

353
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:27,390
Argentine government in 2010 it is aires with

354
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,800
Argentina's Latina, it was wanted to implement

355
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,050
the electronic ticket system

356
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:34,080
nationwide to date, it had been used in the

357
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,510
province of Salta and in the city of

358
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:39,140
Buenos Aires.  aires

359
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,270
to the point they copied it until the

360
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,490
manual

361
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,380
and I have made part of the congo for the Korean company

362
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,660
had all the captures of

363
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,430
all the screens of the examples of

364
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,940
screens with names of 500 Argentines

365
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,190
clearly this system was intended to

366
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:59,070
be used in Argentina not  it was possible to

367
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,139
prove the law that those

368
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:04,379
who would allow a greeting and were finally

369
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:06,569
sold to the republic of congo where

370
00:16:06,569 --> 00:16:07,840
there was a

371
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,360
a quite important scandal for

372
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,160
how to get out of the election that later if they

373
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,150
want we enter into letters

374
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,300
some

375
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,910
problems and real problems new theoretical problems

376
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:23,080


377
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,260
for example it is always said good to

378
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,460
guarantee that these systems are

379
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,280
safe they are reliable they do not

380
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,230
allow fraud they preserve the secret of the vote

381
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,000
which is something very important, maybe we go

382
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,210
into the details, audits are made if

383
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,280
we go we are going to put experts to

384
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,370
audit it that is said especially when

385
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:45,010
you want to sell this type of system the

386
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,110
reality that here we have three

387
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,450
researchers in alex

388
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:53,440
halderman american cary brazada india and  rob

389
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,830
conway or something similar irish

390
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,330
this is a photo subject that they took

391
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:02,060
together when they became a regular

392
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,830
independent one of the

393
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,540
voting machines in india are the one that is

394
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,180
doing the most good photo after that

395
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:11,450
photo with the brother's daughter grip were

396
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,790
expelled from  India's daughter of Prazas

397
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:17,900
disappeared for eight days until then

398
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,150
by pressure i  nternational appears

399
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:23,050
lying in a dungeon

400
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,960
on this side of the mountain range here in

401
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,410
Argentina and in 2015 this

402
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,640
system of the electronic single ticket system

403
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,410
that had been used for

404
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:36,190
years in the province of Salta and had

405
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,050
supposedly been audited by the

406
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,790
authorities  electoral

407
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,310
national universities and others if he used a city

408
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,650
of buenos aires here in the city of

409
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,450
buenos aires he did the audit at the

410
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,580
university of buenos aires a

411
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:52,710
vitality that cost a lot of money they

412
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,059
did not find anything strange it was all

413
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:56,590
fine some minor details

414
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,020
the issue is that a researcher

415
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,669
an independent

416
00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:02,820
computer security researcher

417
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,480
Alfredo Ortega as a result of code that

418
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,970
had been leaked because the company never

419
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:11,340
showed the source code of the system and

420
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,460
found in this case of code a

421
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,500
rather rude error is the bit of

422
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,320
code of the software of the system vor

423
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,990
electronic technique that  counts the votes

424
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,820
without stress every time a

425
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,330
chip is brought to the reader the machine  ina reads it and this

426
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:30,360
bit of code tells it that what

427
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,059
this bit of code does not check that in

428
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:36,720
that ballot effectively makes a vote

429
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,860
if there are several counted several

430
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,410
and these allowed to do things

431
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:47,900
like that 4 1 of 4

432
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,480
the system had read four  Ballots,

433
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,550
but it registered five points,

434
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:56,330
well, this is an error that we

435
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:58,070
do not know since when, possibly since

436
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,700
the beginning of the system six years ago

437
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,200
and it was never detected by any

438
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,170
audit and it had already been used to

439
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:09,620
elect governors in Argentina.

440
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,179


441
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:14,669
and the one who

442
00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:16,590
realized it was a person who in a

443
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,899
free time using code that had been

444
00:19:18,899 --> 00:19:20,669
filtered

445
00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:23,970
something that is illegal not to use it but

446
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,499
filtered we do not know what was the one that a

447
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:29,549
filter found it obviously after

448
00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:31,169
the excuse was how good that this did not

449
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:34,739
allow to do  the great fraud this

450
00:19:34,739 --> 00:19:36,330
could be saved in some way but the

451
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:39,059
reality is that such a gross error from the

452
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:42,029
first programming course was

453
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:45,529
hidden there for years and nadi  And he saw it

454
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,450
later another big problem of this

455
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,040
type of systems not only of this

456
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,070
but in general is how I guarantee that

457
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,810
the secret of the vote is preserved

458
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,420
we here in Argentina with a colleague

459
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,370
here

460
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:03,260
Android made a very simple application

461
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:06,800
that what it did was read a  vote

462
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,890
stored in a ballot the vote that I

463
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:12,510
want to verify

464
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:15,570
and then stored that vote in the

465
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,760
application every time a

466
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,880
ballot approaches it told me if the vote I read

467
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,020
coincided with the one I had stored or

468
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,600
not this can be very simple someone

469
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,230
to buy  Dead

470
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:29,200
in voting for the party that pays the

471
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,679
party to

472
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,750
record with the application how is

473
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,610
the vote of the party and then a voter will read the

474
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,220
phone so that when

475
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,169
you go to vote they carry them in their pocket,

476
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:44,950
pass the chip nearby and the application will

477
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:48,279
then  will tell if I vote for that

478
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:50,230
same party or not is a fairly simple application that is

479
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:53,470
easy to use and

480
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,840
that allows you to buy votes with a cell phone

481
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,659
hidden in your pocket there is no way  It is

482
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:01,210
something that is cached that registers the

483
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,250
voters to make sure that we carry

484
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,809
the commitment

485
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:06,710
in our pocket

486
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,500
another way to break the good vote because of

487
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,760
the way in which the

488
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,240
technology works and we talked, he told us

489
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,700
the vote was just recorded, the vote did not come out

490
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,679
to record something on a chip in

491
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:21,500
raid and I have to transmit it by

492
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,620
radio waves the same to read the

493
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,820
good

494
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,040
together with alfredo ortega he also

495
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,760
did the development we came up with

496
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,760
well what happens if I put a

497
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,100
radio receiver a radio receiver  short wave at

498
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,870
the frequency in which

499
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:45,710
rugby boys work and I listen heard the

500
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:48,980
sound can differ

501
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,200
according to the sound and things what I am

502
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,389
recording so I am recording

503
00:21:53,389 --> 00:21:56,299
a bit pattern or another bit pattern

504
00:21:56,299 --> 00:21:58,960
and finally we did it

505
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,570
there.  You see in the photo it is the first radio

506
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,159
that we use in a radio that is quite

507
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:06,040
small and quite inexpensive

508
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,570
and we were able to

509
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,570
with relatively little time because

510
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:14,460
when we work on these two nights it

511
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:19,470
differs  ignite above 80% of the votes

512
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:22,759
at a distance of

513
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,919
no more than two meters and less than three

514
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:27,799
but more than two meters this is with a

515
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:30,859
radio with a short round with something

516
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:32,929
made expressly for this type of

517
00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:34,549
frequency when connecting a

518
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:36,769
calibrated antenna  for the prophet the frequency range

519
00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:38,200


520
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,270
and with more time fundamentally

521
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:44,820
something much more interesting could be done

522
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:48,510
another problem sabotage good they told me

523
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,400
that here it is always a conference

524
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,870
including a reference to pop culture

525
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:56,269
so the bots

526
00:22:56,269 --> 00:22:57,799
and how you can sabotage a

527
00:22:57,799 --> 00:22:59,260
system  electronic

528
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:02,170
the complicated ways such as implanting

529
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:05,030
something in the code

530
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:07,470
corrupting a programmer

531
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:10,380
hacking the company that develops hacking

532
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,300
a company through the

533
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,270
supply chain something that ends up implanting

534
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,400
something that makes the machines hang within two hours of

535
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,830
voting  the

536
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,820
machine is nailed

537
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,460
with something much simpler like putting

538
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:28,169
in the slot where the gum ballot goes

539
00:23:28,169 --> 00:23:29,999
the printing of a thermal printer

540
00:23:29,999 --> 00:23:31,950
We all know what happens when

541
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,840
a chewing gum is heated and that machine that is

542
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,929
used or forms a little more

543
00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:40,830
technological, such as making a

544
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,539
device like this, that device is

545
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:45,419
quite simple, it has a capacitor from

546
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:48,629
a camera, one from a

547
00:23:48,629 --> 00:23:51,879
double battery to a  switch

548
00:23:51,879 --> 00:23:55,959
and that antenna is basically what it

549
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:59,009
generates is an electromagnetic pulse that,

550
00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:03,599
near the clip, overloads it, they

551
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,290
are passive, they have no power,

552
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:10,530
so they are charged with the energy they

553
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:13,170
receive if more energy was sent to them,

554
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:16,770
what we have done, ivan barrier, another

555
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:19,110
researcher did it.  we put inside

556
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,880
democracy advertising the brand because we

557
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,990
put inside the pack of

558
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:25,170
cigarettes and we showed how by pulling

559
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,730
this new led closer and pressing the button

560
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:30,780
without noise without emitting heat or smoke or

561
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,930
anything else the chip burns someone came up with the

562
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,140
idea of doing something a little bigger

563
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,550
with an antenna  a little bigger that

564
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,650
can be hidden for example in a

565
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,870
thermos to drink mate something quite

566
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:46,830
common in elections  Argentines

567
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,960
and with a larger battery, a

568
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,179
larger capacitor, we can burn all the balls at

569
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:52,710
a reasonable distance, for example

570
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:54,900


571
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,890
, preventing people from voting or burning

572
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:01,200
the ballots inside the ballot box, preventing them from

573
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,370
being read later.

574
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:09,320


575
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,390
For the questions and answers, but

576
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:14,810
basically there is no electronic voting system

577
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:17,390
that to date, if it is

578
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,060
approved, insurance has been stolen, reliable,

579
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,770
there are many statements, there are many people

580
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,750
who say not only can we do it, there are

581
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:26,030
companies that say we did it and

582
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:28,760
they sell it, but  the reality is that to

583
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,680
date there is no system that

584
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,390
exposed to public audits until a

585
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:38,780
result suitable for use in democratic elections

586
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,770


587
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,810
out there for an election of a club it

588
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,600
can be for an election to give

589
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,330
awards to celebrities they can also be used

590
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:50,100
but for elections  For voting

591
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,410
where the fate of a country's democracy is at stake,

592
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:56,490
unfortunately there is

593
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:59,940
no system that is better than the

594
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,759
Voting systems with paper

595
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:04,979
can improve some aspects but

596
00:26:04,979 --> 00:26:08,879
always at the cost of creating much

597
00:26:08,879 --> 00:26:11,039
greater risks of getting us into much

598
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,519
more serious problems

599
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,200
but hey, I just wanted this talk to

600
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,450
be only to tell the bad things

601
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:25,320
what it calls the most but also to show

602
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,169
that there are things that are  They can do with

603
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,149
information technology for the better with the best

604
00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:32,169
of the electoral system,

605
00:26:32,169 --> 00:26:35,679
for example, this is taken from a

606
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,220
report made by the first national scientist

607
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,639
of Argentina in 2017 and what they

608
00:26:42,639 --> 00:26:44,289
did quite simple, quite

609
00:26:44,289 --> 00:26:46,419
obvious, that was to divide the

610
00:26:46,419 --> 00:26:49,700
electoral process has several  stages

611
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,260
Obviously, as in any complex system, it

612
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,120
is very difficult to think of a solution,

613
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,820
a magic bullet that solves all

614
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,810
the problems of all the stages,

615
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:01,330
so it may well be

616
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:04,540
worth analyzing them separately, then,

617
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,430
with respect to the initial vote, what

618
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:09,240
we just said.  The risk of compromising

619
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,320
the secrecy of the vote and

620
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,960
auditability is that which

621
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,760
citizens can  We are sure that

622
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,430
this is the result is very great

623
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:22,840
so there it is convenient today not to interfere without

624
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,600
not putting computers to tackle

625
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,140
one day there will be many very

626
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:33,690
serious people working researching and

627
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:36,760
proving theorems and proving

628
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,070
properties trying to design systems

629
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:41,500
of this type the reality  is that today there

630
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,690
is no one that offers the

631
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:49,210
minimum guarantees then another problem such as I

632
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,860
count the votes as they count the votes

633
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,660
in the voting table well there you

634
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:55,720
can use the computer science and aisha that

635
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,870
healthy color red is orange they are seen

636
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:01,630
there is moderate risks of  altering the

637
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:06,190
result without being able to detect it,

638
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,639
there are also other risks, there are risks of,

639
00:28:08,639 --> 00:28:12,370
for example, sabotage, so there the

640
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:15,070
best solutions are aimed not at

641
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,460
replacing the manual count but at providing

642
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:22,019
tools to improve the tool count.

643
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:25,120


644
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,100
I have the availability

645
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,159
at that time because something happened the power was

646
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,129
cut or a sabotage I can still

647
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:35,420
appeal the  manual method

648
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,930
and then if you can do very

649
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:40,430
interesting things, I am going to show you an

650
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:43,310
example to improve the way in which

651
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:45,560
paper documents are generated in documents

652
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,420
if the results

653
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,910
of each table are going to be there, what do we

654
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:52,780
tell later and then  What we

655
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:55,070
mainly audit many people believe that

656
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,660
when the problem is opened the ballot box and

657
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,210
the votes are counted again that rarely

658
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:01,550
happens what is audited what is shared

659
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,230
what is controlled are the

660
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:06,020
documents generated by the polling station authorities and

661
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,310
there  Yes, things can be done as

662
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:10,220
we said, interesting and finally another

663
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:13,340
point that for years

664
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,260
we have been using this more computer science everywhere but

665
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:18,230
it can be used in a much better way than

666
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:21,710
how we communicate the results if, like

667
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:24,650
me, what was the result of

668
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,770
the election?  only in the portal

669
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:28,780
but

670
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,510
the possibility of disaggregating the

671
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:35,250
results and even reviewing the minutes

672
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:39,310
of each table to be sure that there

673
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:42,810
was no type of manipulation

674
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,930
For example,

675
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:46,790
these are examples taken from the

676
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:49,360
Argentine province of Santa Fe

677
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,420
that a few years ago began to work

678
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,940
from the government, that is, with all

679
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,620
personnel of the

680
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,110
Santa Fe public administration added to people from a

681
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:01,450
national university, they began to think

682
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,570
of a solution first so as not to  to fall into

683
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,700
the one that unfortunately here in Argentina

684
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,370
we have been able to call

685
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,870
a private company that offers us a

686
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,650
product

687
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:15,620
here in the state of Santa Fe that fact is the

688
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:18,940
problem on the shoulder many people who are

689
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:22,550
employed by the government to make

690
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:25,760
computer developments relied on

691
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,990
people from

692
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:30,990
a public university and the conicet and they

693
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:33,900
designed a solution that is quite

694
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,360
interesting, for example to attend the

695
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,110
counting on a tablet

696
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:42,290
the counting of the votes the scrutiny

697
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:44,630
is actually still done on the

698
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:48,920
blackboard with pencil and paper the prosecutors

699
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,559
controlling and all of the  form that was

700
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:54,830
always done but stable for what

701
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,900
it serves to clear that count

702
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,350
that is loaded then  s for each

703
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,390
category, how many votes did each candidate obtain?

704
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:04,940
Who are the authorities?

705
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,190
tables are present?

706
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:10,200


707
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,920


708
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,320


709
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,510
printed

710
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,310
there is the same thing that had been loaded into

711
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,750
the tablet which is the same as there was not the

712
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,430
entire blackboard

713
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:25,680
and also that paper document has the

714
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:30,140
same information in a qr code

715
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,710
so that is used well if qr code

716
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:36,610
is then read with a  cell phone that is a

717
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:39,100
device made

718
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,669
with fibrofacil that they told us turns physical

719
00:31:42,669 --> 00:31:44,140
because it looks like a giraffe with the color of

720
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,539
length basically that is a device to

721
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:50,169
pose a cell phone and use it to take a

722
00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:53,410
picture of each of the minutes read

723
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:56,289
the qr code and transmit  both

724
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,510
towards the computer center where

725
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:01,360
all the tables are scrutinized and

726
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,520
a fairly inexpensive solution is quite

727
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,740
cool and then that cell phone can be

728
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:11,289
reused they can be given to you  to the best

729
00:32:11,289 --> 00:32:13,860
student in the school

730
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,190
and in this way it is possible, as I said

731
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:23,509
just to attend, to support her in a process that

732
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:26,299
is essentially manual and whose

733
00:32:26,299 --> 00:32:28,419
results always have to be

734
00:32:28,419 --> 00:32:31,770
printed on paper

735
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:34,110
and that later on that paper bears the signature

736
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:37,350
of those responsible for generating  After that

737
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,980
document,

738
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:44,030
there are other stages, the provisional scrutiny,

739
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:46,580
that is, the gathering of all the

740
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,800
results of all the tables

741
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,860
here in Argentina, unfortunately, it has been

742
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,100
privatized for several decades.

743
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,530


744
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:59,600


745
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,100


746
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,610


747
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:05,850
that come with their solution that they do not

748
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,650
show to anyone nobody can audit the

749
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:10,740
software and nobody can see if it is safe

750
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:14,600
without manipulating them and sabotage

751
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,200
costs a lot of money not to mention

752
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,440
but that could be improved even they

753
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,460
could be improved that these minutes when

754
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,200
they  generated in each school and

755
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,120
transmitted are not transmitted

756
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,770
only to a computer center

757
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:33,500
of  For example, they can be transmitted

758
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,410
to server centers or

759
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:37,910
computer centers of each

760
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,820
political party or even NGO so that

761
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,470
anyone can receive the results

762
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,840
at the same time and make an independent count,

763
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,500
yes that would be a way to

764
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,750
democratize the results so that

765
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:53,470
everyone  we can exert a cross control

766
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:56,830
and nobody can

767
00:33:56,830 --> 00:34:00,149
put hands or change the results

768
00:34:00,149 --> 00:34:03,090
but it is not to say that these steps

769
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:05,620
because what happens many times and is

770
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:08,649
a little bit of perceiving sometimes is that there is no

771
00:34:08,649 --> 00:34:10,810
need for fraud, you just

772
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:13,480
need the system  do not allow to

773
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,149
ensure fraud again to enable and

774
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:18,070
anyone comes out to shout that there was

775
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:20,070
fraud

776
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:23,219
as it says enrich the work of the

777
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:25,790
foundation via libre the electoral system

778
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:29,190
has to fulfill two objectives the

779
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:31,199
first in the most obvious the most obvious is to

780
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,480
determine who wins an election but

781
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,780
only easier the second is to convince

782
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,100
those who lost that they really

783
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,810
lost

784
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:42,360
and here I refer to the last elections

785
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:46,949
nes in the US where a lot of people were

786
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:49,560
convinced by a speech by Rudolf

787
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,719
Giuliani saying that somehow

788
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:54,449
a conspiracy of the late Hugo Chávez

789
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:57,480
together with the Cubans had managed to

790
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,540
manipulate the result of the election in the

791
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:07,020
US country where 70% or more  does not vote

792
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,120
using computers

793
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,560
where a number of

794
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,920
very varied systems from different providers are used

795
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,570
where almost all have

796
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:22,340
paper and auditable support

797
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,070
they convinced a lot of people the people

798
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,360
who later went to eat and the

799
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:31,640
capitol that in some magical way they did because

800
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,350
as they said  flaubert any

801
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:35,780
sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable

802
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,240
from magic had managed to manipulate

803
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,970
the result so here is another

804
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:42,530
important point whenever we think about

805
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:43,670
these things we have to think not

806
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:46,280
only the result is correct

807
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,640
but the common citizen the voter the

808
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,990
common person who is not  necessarily

809
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:53,330
have computer skills can

810
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:54,830
be sure that it is the result

811
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:57,650
co  Right even when someone wants to

812
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:00,630
deceive you and say active fraud

813
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:03,060
for that a good

814
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,790
system of publication of minutes is also important and here they

815
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:08,520
also put the time this has

816
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,890
to be in real time because if they spend a

817
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:13,380
lot of time between the publication of a

818
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,290
result and it is shown  In evidence, all

819
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:17,910
that time is strongly used

820
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,710
by the opportunists that we were just saying,

821
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:23,790
so here it can be used, we know we

822
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:25,800
know a lot of ways to make

823
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,380
that information available, which is

824
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:31,170
public if the vote on one side of

825
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:33,870
secrecy but the result of each

826
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:36,330
polling station there  up everything is

827
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:39,210
public to make them available as soon as

828
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:40,849
possible

829
00:36:40,849 --> 00:36:44,220
and to allow the scrutiny

830
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:47,400
of the people of the political parties of

831
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,780
the electoral observers but

832
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,430
also of any ordinary citizen who

833
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,990
has the knowledge to use the

834
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:55,349
tools or who have

835
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:57,240
trusted computer programmers who  can

836
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,180
provide tools and that way

837
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:03,830
everyone can do co  Cross-controls

838
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,990
and well, by the way, it was a little

839
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:10,570
quick, I skipped a few things because

840
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:14,050
the idea is to let them ask me questions

841
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:17,800
that we can discuss a bit and I know that they will

842
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,690
ask me if block change is the solution

843
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,619
to voting with computers.

844
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:27,049
solution if it could be the

845
00:37:27,049 --> 00:37:30,109
solution to, for example, the publication of

846
00:37:30,109 --> 00:37:34,059
the minutes and those

847
00:37:34,059 --> 00:37:36,579
democratized controls that I was just talking about

848
00:37:36,579 --> 00:37:38,750
but good to

849
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:42,020
be a bit of the idea shooters a

850
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:44,540
lot of costs together and now spend

851
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,420
some time to discuss punctually what

852
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:50,530
interests them the most

853
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,710
javier wonderful  presentation of

854
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,480
information note that has generated different

855
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,020
comments through our networks and

856
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:04,940
828 so that they connect, they talk to us

857
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,650
in the hashtag that is published

858
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,480
on our screen and I have comments

859
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,010
like the following javier I don't know what you

860
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:11,720
think about this, and then Christine

861
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,730
says it  could study could

862
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,560
study the possibility of flying

863
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,330
through the website of the internal tax service

864
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:19,790
I think  that has good

865
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,800
security at least it has not received it has not

866
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,390
known us let hopefully

867
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:25,040
tax returns seem like a good

868
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,840
option suddenly dt analyze it towards an

869
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,980
institution like that

870
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,050
here there is a problem that is fundamental

871
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:34,440
which is the problem of secrecy as well as to

872
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,300
do  systems that record

873
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,109
transactions safely,

874
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:41,310
guaranteeing integrity that we

875
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:44,070
know how to do when we buy, we move

876
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,810
money, we do everything through

877
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:46,830
information technology,

878
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:49,230
that we know how to do what we don't know

879
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:51,780
is how to do that, what cannot be done is to

880
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:56,090
do that while guaranteeing the  secret

881
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:59,930
because how can I ensure that

882
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:01,910
that voter who votes through

883
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:04,870
that super secure and super reliable system

884
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:07,610
is not being pressured at that moment, he

885
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:09,860
does not have someone next to him telling him

886
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:13,390
that you have to vote in a certain way

887
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:16,870
that is the first problem for which

888
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:21,970
we  we get into this whole mess the vote the

889
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:24,670
vote there are countries that vote this way

890
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,650
and countries that have presidents and countries

891
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:27,970
that have  There are congresses with prime

892
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:30,280
ministers, there are countries where everyone votes,

893
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,550
there are countries where there are no countries

894
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,990
where a single party of countries where

895
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:38,380
20 now has the secret vote in all

896
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,740
the countries of the world and for more than

897
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:45,310
a century and metric and for  What because if

898
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:48,400
I do not guarantee if the system does not give

899
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,800
someone the possibility to vote

900
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,640
against or in a different way to the one

901
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,740
they are sent, they force it

902
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:01,700
then the system serves us and that is why they

903
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,940
make us go to vote in a place where it

904
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:07,880
is  the public forces guard what

905
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,310
nothing strange happens and they give me a

906
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:13,070
private and reserved place and a

907
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:16,340
voting method where I can be sure

908
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:19,040
that no one will know how beautiful I put or

909
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,860
where I made the mark on the ballot

910
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,590
when we put a system  computer, even if

911
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:26,750
it is a voting machine put

912
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,420
in a sheltered room, I am

913
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,710
sure the poster is not spying on me,

914
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:32,750


915
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:36,140
these are two things, I can be

916
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:38,480
sure that no one will know how to vote

917
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,610
and also I have to be safe

918
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:42,080
Who wants to force me to vote in a

919
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,650
certain way

920
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:50,739
with arduino?

921
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:55,479


922
00:40:55,479 --> 00:40:58,989


923
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:00,690


924
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:03,540


925
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,430
Lots of things

926
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,220
that can be done, for example,

927
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:11,400
we said is the trick of putting a

928
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,680
unique identifier and then I

929
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,140
can't count it twice,

930
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,319
these chips can be emulated, we can follow as they

931
00:41:19,319 --> 00:41:23,210
refer and Chinese that have that

932
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:26,760
modifiable then with  a next one with

933
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,440
a mini family with a lot of

934
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,569
hardware that they have turned around, you

935
00:41:30,569 --> 00:41:32,970
can do things to bring a

936
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,740
device to a machine of these and

937
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:37,680
inject votes and the system counts them

938
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,750
as if they were really

939
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:43,109
passing paper balls in front of it

940
00:41:43,109 --> 00:41:44,940
afterwards  I'm going to leave you if you want

941
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,470
some lingua you can't see in my blog

942
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:51,960
blog where dotcom score there is

943
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,940
everything that I have written and compiled of the

944
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,289
things that I have done  Together with other

945
00:41:55,289 --> 00:41:58,049
people over the years they can also

946
00:41:58,049 --> 00:42:00,539
look for the wallpaper that

947
00:42:00,539 --> 00:42:04,760
the Paraguayan NGO published a short time ago. You dedicate yourself

948
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,180
to the electronic ballot and write

949
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,240
an article of more than 20 pages

950
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,730
counting

951
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,920
the possible attacks on this type of

952
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:19,460
system and some way  to mitigate the no

953
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,470
to some of them

954
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:23,840
so well there you can find more

955
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,300
information the following comment

956
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,609
seems to be easy of course it says the

957
00:42:28,609 --> 00:42:30,619
cryptographic or more physical algorithms

958
00:42:30,619 --> 00:42:32,570
are a real reliable alternative for

959
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:34,870
the electronic voting system

960
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:40,030
and I have here in Chile practically with

961
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,380
the  The cogito issue forced the majority

962
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,550
of citizens to obtain the

963
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:44,500
unique password which is a robust system that

964
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,090
can easily support an

965
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:47,200
electronic voting system through this

966
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,270
medium

967
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:50,410
but with double authentication at the

968
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:53,689
time of casting the vote,

969
00:42:53,689 --> 00:42:56,489
the idea works  the idea on paper

970
00:42:56,489 --> 00:42:57,989
works now the issue is the

971
00:42:57,989 --> 00:43:00,089
implementation in practice how can I

972
00:43:00,089 --> 00:43:01,729
ensure the security  Security of that terminal

973
00:43:01,729 --> 00:43:04,049
there is an example of a system that was being

974
00:43:04,049 --> 00:43:05,729
used in those years in the Estonian system,

975
00:43:05,729 --> 00:43:08,069
this since first they are

976
00:43:08,069 --> 00:43:10,499
very small countries, second, the people who

977
00:43:10,499 --> 00:43:12,599
vote through the internet in Estonia are very

978
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:17,279
few and third every Estonian citizen

979
00:43:17,279 --> 00:43:20,459
it has a chip of a DNI an

980
00:43:20,459 --> 00:43:23,390
identification card with a cryptographic chip

981
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:26,549
and in this way

982
00:43:26,549 --> 00:43:28,880


983
00:43:29,509 --> 00:43:32,569
the inscription of the extreme issue is ensured in quotation marks what is

984
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:34,299
the problem

985
00:43:34,299 --> 00:43:36,910
no one can be sure

986
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:38,769
that there is no software on the computer used by that person who is

987
00:43:38,769 --> 00:43:41,140
voting  malicious

988
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,630
run there and as a basis just not

989
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:45,549
willing to be sure that there is no

990
00:43:45,549 --> 00:43:47,410
one questioning the person who

991
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:49,709
is voting,

992
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:55,080
come and vote people come in line to

993
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:58,020
vote with their cryptographic chip and also

994
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,290
the party pays and in that way

995
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:02,490
we buy votes that is  what we have

996
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:06,170
to guarantee that it cannot be done

997
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:08,610
what do you think require open source of

998
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:10,930


999
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:13,599
minimal loot that is the minimum that we

1000
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:15,069
always follow every time someone tells us

1001
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,890
this system is safe to vote

1002
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:19,900
first before anything else show me the

1003
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,210
source code is not enough is not

1004
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:23,380
enough

1005
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:26,349
but even that does not comply in

1006
00:44:26,349 --> 00:44:29,319
Argentina the source code of the

1007
00:44:29,319 --> 00:44:32,260
voting application we were able to audit it

1008
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:35,200
we could look at it because it

1009
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,589
leaked yes because someone left for

1010
00:44:38,589 --> 00:44:40,329
example  divide thrown in the garbage

1011
00:44:40,329 --> 00:44:42,619
after an election

1012
00:44:42,619 --> 00:44:45,980
but even for having this divides the

1013
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:48,380
province of jumps a criminal case that

1014
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:50,299
was opened to determine who

1015
00:44:50,299 --> 00:44:53,589
stole it and there I let it have garbage if it

1016
00:44:53,589 --> 00:44:56,509
is an indispensable condition necessary to

1017
00:44:56,509 --> 00:44:58,880
show the source code but it is not

1018
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,760
Enough

1019
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,060


1020
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,190
question effect then we would have to update

1021
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:07,110
the face-to-face vote and continue

1022
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:08,280
investigating some type of

1023
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,840
encryption hardware for unit voting

1024
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:15,000
yes to see the face-to-face vote

1025
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,850
because I just said there doesn't seem to be any

1026
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:20,829
other option there is no in the world

1027
00:45:20,829 --> 00:45:25,989
and what technology we use is

1028
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:28,869
the other way around is to think about what problems we have

1029
00:45:28,869 --> 00:45:32,559
and from there to look for what technology can then

1030
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:34,740
do it for you  solve

1031
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:39,030
the casting of the vote and this in the world

1032
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:41,369
of the first 20 countries according to the

1033
00:45:41,369 --> 00:45:42,810


1034
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:46,380
United Nations Human Development Index 19 vote exclusively with

1035
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:49,770
hand-marked paper ballots and the

1036
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:52,290
remaining 20 are two United States and vote

1037
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:53,670
mostly with the rhythm of the

1038
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:58,020
system  If now, for example,

1039
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:00,119
South Korea uses two very ingenious systems, they

1040
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:03,119
use ballots marked with an

1041
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:05,940
entourage with a special ink and then they

1042
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:08,850
use the machines to appear

1043
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:11,670
the mail envelope sorters to

1044
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:13,320
separate the ballots according to where they

1045
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,810
have the mark and then they are counted.  The

1046
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:18,150
piles with all the brands in the

1047
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,190
same place are counted in the hand are

1048
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:23,610
ways to improve to optimize but it is

1049
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:27,119
essential that everything can be done if

1050
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,550
the dependence and without the trust in a

1051
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:31,520
technological device

1052
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,140
I am talking, for example, of

1053
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:36,110
South Korea which is  the country that in general

1054
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:38,990
uses more information technology in

1055
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:41,300
education in all and on the most technological country in

1056
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,650
the world more than  In japan

1057
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:45,800
perhaps and the types continue to vote with

1058
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,660
hand-marked paper ballots and

1059
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:50,250
counting the handwritten ones

1060
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:53,220
for something will be a question especially of

1061
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,500
older adults for whom

1062
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,080
this process is more difficult the keys

1063
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,550
because they are handled by family or

1064
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:01,980
friends where the  secrecy in that

1065
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,880
instance with the elderly

1066
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,650
and talking is terribly

1067
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:08,049
discriminatory also for people to

1068
00:47:08,049 --> 00:47:10,539
see for everyone because I from

1069
00:47:10,539 --> 00:47:12,549
the moment in which to be sure

1070
00:47:12,549 --> 00:47:14,500
that this system is reliable I have to

1071
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,410
commission an audit that was going to be an

1072
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:20,289
elite in a group of people who know

1073
00:47:20,289 --> 00:47:22,240
things that the rest of the citizens do not

1074
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:26,140
know and these people decide and say that

1075
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:27,609
everything is fine so we all have

1076
00:47:27,609 --> 00:47:31,059
to trust well that is the reason

1077
00:47:31,059 --> 00:47:33,880
why the German higher constitutional court

1078
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,450


1079
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,810
practically declared

1080
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:40,400
Germany unconstitutional  the electronic vote since

1081
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,500
that day of that ruling in germany never

1082
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,589
again tried to use an

1083
00:47:44,589 --> 00:47:48,099
electronic voting system

1084
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:51,980
that is  a very important and quite interesting signal

1085
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:53,240


1086
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,750
javier we are reaching the end

1087
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:59,240
we want to thank his presence and this

1088
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,490
tremendous information about your

1089
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:03,920
work and study appearing and the fact of wanting to

1090
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,050
expose it in 8.8 government seems

1091
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:07,580
wonderful to us especially because our

1092
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:10,070
first instance with this with this

1093
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:13,700
date and  We essentially hope it will be

1094
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,760
extended over the years, thanks

1095
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,200
for this space and thanks for your

1096
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:22,400
information for the invitation and well,

1097
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,740
I'm just telling you a

1098
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:26,540
little about the work that many people have done

1099
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:28,060
here in Argentina, for example

1100
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:31,340
we were a group of a few

1101
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:33,380
computer scientists as well  People of law from

1102
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,750
other areas of knowledge, let's say,

1103
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:38,000
but it is essential that

1104
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,820
computer scientists get involved in these things, get

1105
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:44,480
interested, learn and investigate and

1106
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,000


1107
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,950
help so that the tools and technology

1108
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:50,500
that we handle can contribute

1109
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,800
to improve things and not make them worse

1110
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,110
but introduce new risks  so

1111
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:59,290
good no  s encouraged a little to all who

1112
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:02,500
are watching this to be interested in

1113
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,820
the subject and commit a little and

1114
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:09,220
help if we all give

1115
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:10,960
thanks perfect I like that phrase that

1116
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,100
says that cybersecurity one does not

1117
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:13,720
compete you said it just in the morning

1118
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,090
Catherine contributes a lot to one,

1119
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:18,610
javier, thanks for your time, thanks for

1120
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:20,170
the information, and we hope that on the

1121
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:21,550
day the second

1122
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:22,840
event is in person again after the coi,

1123
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:27,130
we hope to have you do it soon, we hope

1124
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,210
the same, thank you very much, we

1125
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:32,170
continue with 8.8 government, we continue

1126
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:34,750
with  this information marathon that is

1127
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:36,240
carried out

1128
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,670
together with that is, together with has and

1129
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:40,830
obviously together with all of you who

1130
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:42,150
are connected at this time through

1134
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:51,030
commenting with the hashtag that now

1135
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:52,440
appears on the screen and that you are

1136
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,030
also participating by your questions

1137
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:58,140
for your comment and essentially

1138
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:00,180
all over the network disco org

1139
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,490
instagram twitter anyway through all those

1140
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:04,500
places the audience comes, they tell us

1141
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,850
they ask us questions we will comment on them

1142
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:08,280
we make it public through streaming

1143
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,600
so that I can talk with the different

1144
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,640
panelists we are going to take a little

1145
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,370
break with our sponsors and then

1146
00:50:14,370 --> 00:50:18,120


1147
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,520
Catalina channels director of csic

1148
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:23,310
we are going to have a quite

1149
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:26,910
remarkable conference we have a meeting of

1150
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:28,650
executive women in cybersecurity which are

1151
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:29,550
going to expose a series of

1152
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:31,230
proposals that have to do with the

1153
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:32,900
situation to be in Latin America

1154
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:36,150
caterina part  sometime more we

1155
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:37,710
go to a short video break and

1156
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:39,270
we return immediately here in the

1157
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:42,350
