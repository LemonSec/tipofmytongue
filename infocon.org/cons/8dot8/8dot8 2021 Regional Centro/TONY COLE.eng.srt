for me but uh thank you for your time uh

26
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,479
i hope you enjoy this session it should

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,320
be you know

28
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,400
informational it's only 30 minutes but i

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,920
mean it gives you a good taste if you've

30
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,799
never heard of mitre's engage framework

31
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,240
i think one of the most important things

32
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,080
to think about today is

33
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,439
all of the breaches that are taking

34
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,880
place and we're going to talk about that

35
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,320
in a minute because

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,240
they continue to happen regardless of

37
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,680
the spend that we put in place on

38
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,240
preventative tools so in mitre's engaged

39
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,640
framework is another way to look at

40
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,880
active defense so we'll talk about that

41
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,759
there we go

42
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,439
so the agenda who is miter and why

43
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,960
should you care

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,960
a more defensive posture through active

45
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,479
defense

46
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,720
minor attack and engage

47
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,040
some use case examples

48
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,280
just some ideas for stopping attacks and

49
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,280
how we need to understand attackers and

50
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,280
then of course a quick wrap-up of what

51
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,759
we covered

52
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,439
so miter

53
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,560
any of you

54
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,759
may have not may not have heard of mitre

55
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,959
miter is what's called an

56
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:11,520
ffrdc in the united states and that is a

57
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,680
federally funded research and

58
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,760
development corporation so they're a

59
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,560
not-for-profit organization however they

60
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,959
exist at the behest of the the u.s

61
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,440
government to solve uh very tough

62
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,680
problems and obviously i think everybody

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,599
in the room there and everybody online

64
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,920
knows that cyber security is a tough

65
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,319
problem to solve so they've spent a

66
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,160
couple of decades working on this

67
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,360
challenge and what we're going to touch

68
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,440
on today is some of their recent efforts

69
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,599
so first before we jump into mitre let's

70
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,599
talk a little bit about active defense

71
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,519
what is it what isn't it and i think

72
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,200
that's important

73
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,160
active defense is really about slowing

74
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,200
an attacker down uh out maneuvering them

75
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,040
you know and making that attack more

76
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,280
difficult to uh for them to accomplish

77
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,120
their goals you know if you can slow

78
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,879
them down and derail them and at the

79
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,400
same time get alerts on them throughout

80
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,879
that entire process then it really can

81
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,800
help you tremendously in being

82
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,720
successful in countering you know or

83
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,440
mitigating the impact of an attack

84
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,680
i think it's an important note you see

85
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,599
some stories from reporters and they

86
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,040
talk about you shouldn't do active

87
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,440
defense because they always incorporate

88
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,519
hacking back into active defense and

89
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,120
that's absolutely not true we're not

90
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,280
talking about doing anything outside of

91
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,680
your own uh enterprise where you're

92
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,760
doing defensive measures and active

93
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,239
defense is a defensive measure inside

94
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,000
your environment

95
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,920
of course i had to drop loki on my slide

96
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,239
simply because loki is the uh the god of

97
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,480
mischief if you're an avengers fan and

98
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,640
now probably aware that you know he does

99
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,560
a lot of uh

100
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,959
offensive actions you know uh when he's

101
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,319
fighting and other things where he can

102
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,400
be in multiple places at once or appear

103
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,319
that way so it's it's a good tie into

104
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,560
active defense in my in my opinion but

105
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,120
the whole concept of active defense is

106
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,760
really around you know uh causing the

107
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,239
attacker to incur more costs by

108
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,840
providing them information they can't

109
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,080
trust and that's something that many

110
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,159
defenders haven't done in the past you

111
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,000
know taking home field advantage

112
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,120
understanding

113
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,799
your enterprise and making the

114
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,200
adversary's job much more difficult when

115
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,040
they do get in and they do get in we

116
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,000
need that assumption of breach mentality

117
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,600
to think about the fact that sooner or

118
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,759
later our defenses will fail and how are

119
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,080
we going to ensure the the attacker

120
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,560
doesn't accomplish their goals inside

121
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,960
your enterprise

122
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,960
uh just really quick on this uh you know

123
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,040
nist has a guide uh if you're not

124
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,440
familiar with nist it is the national

125
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,600
institute of standards and technologies

126
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,160
here in the united states most people

127
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,600
around the globe know them because

128
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,360
they're the ones that built the the

129
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,160
first real cyber security framework and

130
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,240
uh the you know hundreds of controls in

131
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,040
this special publication 853.

132
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,040
the interesting point on this uh this

133
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,120
one that i was trying to make is it so

134
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,759
they talk a lot about using deception to

135
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,520
counter advanced persistent threats

136
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,000
nation state actors and we probably all

137
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
know that there's been a lot of blending

138
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,320
between nation state actors and criminal

139
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,720
you know groups as well over the last uh

140
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,000
four or five years so a lot more ttps

141
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,240
that the criminals are using that mirror

142
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,440
what uh

143
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,360
nation-state attackers are doing so it's

144
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,960
important to note that the

145
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,919
nist in mitre worked hand-in-hand and

146
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,320
nist is very focused on active defense

147
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,479
and deception

148
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,520
so

149
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,039
i'm probably preaching to the choir here

150
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,440
but i'd like to drop this slide anyway

151
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,520
why is active defense needed i think

152
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,440
it's important to look at just some of

153
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,840
the major cases just since december of

154
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,560
2020 there's been some huge attacks that

155
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,960
have had significant impact around the

156
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,280
globe i pulled these down from the

157
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,160
website on the bottom and by the way

158
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,759
for the organizers there gabrielle and

159
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,600
others i can afford these slides if

160
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,680
anybody would like them but the link at

161
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,479
the bottom is from the us

162
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,400
center for strategic and international

163
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,319
studies and they have been studying and

164
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,720
capturing data on cyber attacks for some

165
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,479
time and these are some major ones on

166
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,840
their website right now there's a lot

167
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,000
more i just pulled down just a few

168
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,600
why is this important

169
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,720
because

170
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,120
we're still spending this year alone

171
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,720
according to gartner

172
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,800
150.4

173
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,440
billion us dollars this year

174
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,440
so regardless of the spend you know

175
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,600
we're still seeing massive attacks take

176
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,919
place successfully so it's something we

177
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,160
need to think about and consider are we

178
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,479
doing all the right things or would we

179
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,240
fit into one of these stories right here

180
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,160
on the screen you know with the way

181
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,840
we've structured and instrumented our

182
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,800
defensive posture in our enterprise so

183
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,160
it's an important point to think about

184
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,919
are you doing something different so if

185
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,919
those same actors tried to go get into

186
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,160
your system would they be successful in

187
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,800
accomplishing their goals

188
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,599
so

189
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,840
minor attack and engage

190
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,080
if you're not familiar with minor attack

191
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,080
it's probably most of you are but in

192
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,280
case there's a few in the room that are

193
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,240
not minor attack is a very interesting

194
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,599
program you can see the link at the

195
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,520
bottom it's free for anybody around the

196
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,960
world to utilize

197
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,360
and it stands for adversarial tactics

198
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,440
and techniques and common knowledge so

199
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,960
what they're doing is mitre is

200
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,599
collecting data from

201
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,639
attackers so from observables across

202
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,000
enterprises around the globe where

203
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,319
people feed information in to mitre as

204
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,800
well as miter does their own capture too

205
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,240
to show you you know how to pick a path

206
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,000
for the attacker that's going after you

207
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,080
what do they usually do you know do they

208
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,599
do a you know a spear phishing

209
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,599
attachment in my example here

210
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,319
exploitation for client execution

211
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,880
hooking so the point is you can track

212
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,880
them and go across your environment

213
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,960
based on this this monitor framework

214
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,680
this database and understand typically

215
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,560
from that who that attacker is are they

216
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,479
a nation state or are they a criminal

217
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,599
group and if they if you identify them

218
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,000
from mitre attack at that point in time

219
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,080
you can potentially identify who the

220
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,039
attacker is based on the common ttps

221
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,280
that that attacker may utilize so you

222
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,680
would know if it's apt-29

223
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,400
comfy bear cozy bear panda bear whatever

224
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,240
attacker a vendor may call it when

225
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,840
you're reading a report miter

226
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,840
standardizes all those names and can

227
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,160
help show you who's after you that can

228
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,039
actually help you really understand

229
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,039
who's trying to break into your system

230
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,520
what are their goals so should i spend

231
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,319
more of my time and effort and resources

232
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,080
on to protecting some specific

233
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,320
high-value assets simply because you

234
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,320
know these are the type of attackers

235
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,399
that go after you and that would be

236
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,080
their goal so it's a really important

237
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,000
thing mitre attack is really cool it's

238
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,839
been uh implemented by many many

239
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:42,880
companies

240
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,519
around the globe and many governments as

241
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,480
well

242
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,160
so if you're not familiar with it i

243
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,680
would highly recommend you take a look

244
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,240
it's very very helpful there's a ton of

245
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,040
videos and mitre has you know uh

246
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,600
webinars pretty consistently so where

247
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,200
you can jump in and learn more about

248
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,519
attack in different areas

249
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,240
so

250
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,320
as i stated attack puts threats in

251
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,399
context you know you can see on the left

252
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,040
hand side from initial access execution

253
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,800
all the way down to exfiltration and

254
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,920
impact it it helps you understand what

255
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,680
the adversary is doing inside your

256
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,399
environment so very very beneficial uh

257
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,080
to dive in if you're not looking at

258
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,399
miter attack and potentially see if it

259
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,800
fits in well with whatever framework

260
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,680
you're using as well as

261
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,240
the structure for your strategic program

262
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,160
what are your goals in that program when

263
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,680
an adversary gets in are you trying to

264
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,040
just kick them out as quickly as

265
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,200
possible learn from it and block the

266
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,880
hole or do you want to study those

267
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,880
adversaries and understand what they're

268
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,720
trying to accomplish in your system a

269
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,320
lot of different things you can do here

270
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,720
but again attack very very helpful in

271
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,360
understanding the adversary and their

272
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,839
ttps

273
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:52,560
so

274
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,480
what is it we just talked about mitre

275
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,959
attack what about mitre engage what is

276
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,000
engage

277
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,839
engage is

278
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,680
the yang to the yen of miter attack so

279
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,079
it's really helping understand

280
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,000
what you should do if you're studying

281
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,760
mitre attack and looking at those

282
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,079
patterns the attackers are doing inside

283
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,160
your environment engage gives you the

284
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,040
capability to build an active defense to

285
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,560
counter those attacks

286
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,800
so one side is focused on the adversary

287
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
the other side is focused on helping you

288
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,959
build a defensive structure against

289
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,200
those adversaries inside the environment

290
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,399
and we'll get into that a little bit

291
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,720
deeper if you're not familiar with the

292
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,240
term in the middle of the symbol in the

293
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,880
middle uh it's a chinese symbol yin and

294
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,720
yang and it just shows how two pieces

295
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,040
are complementary and fit together well

296
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,920
so an attack and engage definitely uh

297
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,200
fit those fit those roles well so engage

298
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,959
is really that knowledge base of how to

299
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,160
defend using engagement of the adversary

300
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,720
inside your enterprise inside your home

301
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,720
field

302
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,600
so the mitre engaged structure you know

303
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,680
really breaks things down into strategic

304
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,240
actions and engagement actions with the

305
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,399
strategic side you know you're looking

306
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,480
at you know goals approaches and

307
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,480
activities that are going to support

308
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,720
your operational strategy so what are

309
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,640
you trying to accomplish what do you

310
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,519
want out of you know an active defense

311
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,000
so it's really on the strategic side the

312
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,160
engagement actions are really the steps

313
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,920
you're going to take in the uh

314
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,440
instrumentation you're going to build so

315
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,000
to help engage the adversary inside your

316
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
enterprise so it's a really cool

317
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,320
structure and one that no one had mapped

318
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,640
out previously

319
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,399
from this path a little bit like the

320
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,920
security framework that nist has and

321
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,000
some others but i think this is a much

322
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,320
more complementary before we go any

323
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,760
further on this i want to point out

324
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,959
engage is brand new so uh it's a version

325
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,839
0.9 not even 1.0 yet

326
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,760
miter is looking for more and more teams

327
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,240
to you know pun intended engage with

328
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,880
them and uh and help them make this a a

329
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,120
much better program i think it's come a

330
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,839
long way and this came out of what used

331
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,240
to be mitre shield instead they changed

332
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,399
it to mitre engage and revamp the

333
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,720
program uh based on feedback from

334
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,760
industry around the globe

335
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,279
so when you're looking at those

336
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,120
strategic goals again the first piece

337
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,959
you want to do is prepare you know and

338
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,639
really help you think about what do you

339
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,480
want to accomplish if you're going to do

340
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,560
active defense inside your environment

341
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,480
using the engaged structure

342
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,399
and then the other piece of course is

343
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,040
you want to understand gather that data

344
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,800
capture the data from your engagement

345
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,680
side and make sure it's being utilized

346
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,279
to help your blue teams and your

347
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,440
security operations center or defend

348
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,360
your environment because that's the goal

349
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,839
if we're looking at adversary ttps and

350
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,000
building instrumentation to counter them

351
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,240
we want to make sure that at every pass

352
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,399
and every effort that we have when we

353
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,240
engage an adversary we get better at

354
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,839
defensive side you know it can

355
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,040
potentially keep them out

356
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,839
so if you look a little deeper onto the

357
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,160
engagement goals so you've done the

358
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,000
strategic piece you've now thought about

359
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
uh here's what i want to get out of this

360
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
here's my goals on it then of course you

361
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,920
start to build the engagement piece out

362
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,079
you want to expose the adversary

363
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,560
operations you want to affect those

364
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,560
operations of course and you want to

365
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,880
elicit information pull information out

366
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,200
about those ttps from the adversary so

367
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,120
you can see right from these these three

368
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,240
you know uh

369
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,720
categories here you're really looking at

370
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,040
you know how this ties into attack so

371
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,560
you can see in an attack what an

372
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,560
adversary does now you're looking inside

373
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,079
your own environment to see if the

374
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,920
attacker is still mirroring what mitre

375
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,760
attack told you they were going to do or

376
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,760
have they changed have they evolved and

377
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,720
if so

378
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,320
that's great data to feed back into

379
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,760
mitre attack as well as miter engage

380
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,839
so if you look under the hood deeper at

381
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,519
engage

382
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,959
it's really interesting to me the

383
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,800
engagement piece

384
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,639
the exposed piece you know you've got

385
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,120
collection and detection decoy artifacts

386
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,680
and systems detonating malware you know

387
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,839
the effect side there's a ton of pieces

388
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,680
that you can do in there you know where

389
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,600
you're you know you're baselining your

390
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,160
system you know detonating malware again

391
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,480
you know manipulating email it's a lot

392
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,480
of fun you can have in in this space you

393
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,399
know doing this the illicit side of

394
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,639
course is you know looking at and

395
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,519
capturing all of that that data you know

396
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,240
on an adversary uh if you even look in

397
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,639
the far right hand column where it says

398
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,720
personas under motivation you know

399
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,959
there's there's so much you can do there

400
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,839
you know uh to to

401
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,240
really engage that adversary

402
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,079
and collect data so that you understand

403
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,079
who they are when you're building this

404
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,560
structure out for for an act defense you

405
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,639
may potentially even build you know as

406
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,720
part of your your program

407
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,720
build strategic personas that aren't

408
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,639
real inside your environment maybe

409
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,720
you've got a research and development

410
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,480
division and you want to build up you

411
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,680
know a campaign around that to ensure

412
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,320
that the attacker goes into that you

413
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,279
know

414
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,279
research and development you know fake

415
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,680
data so and that's what they're trying

416
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,199
to steal and you start to understand

417
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,600
their ttp's better it's a tremendous

418
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,480
amount

419
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,399
of functionality that you can get out of

420
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,040
this and this is a system where you can

421
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,279
click down click down click down and

422
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,600
really look at the direct ttps and how

423
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,000
it relates back to attack as well and

424
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,600
you're going to see a lot more come out

425
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,800
version one

426
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,720
they think is is going to come out

427
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,880
sometime in the fourth quarter of this

428
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,399
year so sometime in the next three

429
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,800
months since we're almost in october

430
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,880
hopefully it won't slip i know there's a

431
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,279
great team led by dr stan barr that

432
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,279
mitre and mclean virginia focused on

433
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,720
this now

434
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,519
if we put together the engage and the

435
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,160
strategic goals this is a direct cut

436
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,240
right out of the mitre program itself so

437
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,839
if you look on the left hand side you

438
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,160
know your prepare and your planning and

439
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,240
what you're trying to get out of this

440
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,160
and then after you've gone through the

441
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,800
expose effect illicit pieces you know

442
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,880
and you built out an engagement of that

443
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,360
adversary when they get in then at the

444
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,120
end you've got another strategic goal

445
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,040
and that's understanding you know what

446
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,199
were they doing you know hot wash is

447
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,160
like an after-action report so you know

448
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,000
you and your your team can sit down and

449
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,759
walk through all right how did we engage

450
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,440
this adversary where did our

451
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,600
instrumentation fall down what should we

452
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,000
do better next time uh what should we

453
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,759
add and potentially you know what should

454
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,920
we pull out what what did we not need

455
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,279
inside there because you don't want to

456
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,120
make this a heavy burden and it it

457
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,800
doesn't need to be

458
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
and you can do this specifically around

459
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,880
specific high value assets like active

460
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,800
directory uh maybe some critical

461
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,880
databases that you have lots of

462
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,040
different ways to do this and lead the

463
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,120
adversary away from those high value

464
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,920
assets into you know a decoy system or

465
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,000
some other structure or just feed

466
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,920
incorrect information to them you know

467
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,160
from active directory in in other

468
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,480
systems easy to do today

469
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,160
so it can be a tremendous amount of fun

470
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,639
so here's a quick quick example of this

471
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,720
you know looking at you know an active

472
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,360
directory ransomware attack sequence if

473
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,040
you look on the left hand side at number

474
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,920
one

475
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,919
still the most common means today is a

476
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,559
spear phishing email that comes in

477
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,720
somebody may spoof an email address from

478
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,039
the ceo and send somebody that they know

479
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,599
is gonna you know click on right away or

480
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,280
maybe they send it to a few people to

481
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,280
see if somebody clicks on it right away

482
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,439
but let's just say that

483
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,039
that user does click on it and

484
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,280
compromises that initial system maybe

485
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,439
the email had a weaponized attachment in

486
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,600
it or maybe it was a malicious url they

487
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,760
clicked on in the email anyway the point

488
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,280
is that that that user is compromised

489
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,360
at that point in time and the attacker

490
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,679
is now on that system at number one and

491
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,840
has an initial credentials stolen so

492
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,679
they've got a set of credentials

493
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,600
one of the first things you see is quite

494
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,840
often with cloud presence

495
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,679
we see a lot of organizations uh over

496
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,720
appropriate you know entitlements to

497
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,799
users so and even if that user didn't

498
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,880
use all of those and most of them don't

499
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,320
the first thing attacker is going to do

500
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,000
is look to see what entitlements they

501
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,320
have for that user so kind of kind of

502
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,679
scary

503
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,120
the next piece that attacker does of

504
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,039
course is discover targets you know they

505
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,799
look for targets and one of the most

506
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,559
common means is looking at active

507
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,559
directory hence why i picked this

508
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,919
selection

509
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,280
if you

510
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,080
know the fireeye mandiant team they're

511
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,720
very large and well respected team

512
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,720
they stated earlier this year that the

513
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,840
90

514
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,960
of the

515
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,520
incident response investigations they do

516
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,360
you know for their customers globally

517
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,440
all focus on you know where the attacker

518
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,919
was utilizing active directory so that's

519
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,919
that's a pretty shocking statistic in an

520
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,600
area that's that's ignored too much

521
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,600
hence why i picked this one so number

522
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,480
three

523
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,400
once the adversary has stolen those

524
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,559
credentials looked at the targets then

525
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,799
they compromised those targets what's

526
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,240
interesting is we see we don't see the

527
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,720
ransomware 1-0 uh very much and i guess

528
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,000
i could remove that and just stay with

529
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,840
ransomware too or

530
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,760
some companies called it multifaceted

531
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,840
extortion but they find that domain

532
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,000
admin pc they move laterally they steal

533
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,799
credentials they create persistence and

534
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,640
unfortunately they also encrypt high

535
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,080
value targets

536
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,160
and they steal and exfiltrate data so if

537
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,760
somebody decides they're not paying the

538
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,840
ransom the attacker could say oh we'll

539
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,080
look at this very sensitive intellectual

540
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,320
property that i've stolen from your

541
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,799
environment and now i'm going to uh you

542
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,960
know

543
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,360
share that on the web to embarrass you

544
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,360
or you know financially hurt the company

545
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,559
since it could be their intellectual

546
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,080
property so that's what we're seeing

547
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,559
most time is ransomware2o but the point

548
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,799
is that you know uh these attacks are

549
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,880
common and you can take components of

550
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,120
what i have have up here for an example

551
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,120
and relate them back to many of the

552
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,919
attacks uh in the past year that have

553
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,559
been uh you know huge impact around the

554
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,960
globe to multinational companies so what

555
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,679
do we do so we look at this we tied into

556
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,760
you know miter attack we

557
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,760
try to look at the ttps how do we

558
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,240
counter this well hopefully you have an

559
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,480
assumption of breach mentality

560
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,159
and with that assumption breach

561
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,440
mentality then you know you can

562
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,640
turn around and realize you're going to

563
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,080
get breached so you've been looking at

564
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,400
attack you've built an instrumentation

565
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,840
for engage

566
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,000
so we would add in you know components

567
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,080
for derailing that attack across the

568
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,720
board adding decoy assets that you know

569
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,159
the adversary does a scan uh they query

570
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,559
active directory they try to get real

571
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,720
information and instead you know you've

572
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,520
got

573
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,600
an engage structure built and you

574
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,520
provide deceptive information back to

575
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,039
them they don't even see who the real

576
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,120
administrators are and maybe you even

577
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,440
lead them off to a decoy domain

578
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,200
controller lots of things you can do

579
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,080
there

580
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,640
you can deflect exploits so you know

581
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,799
someone scans a system and you know you

582
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,880
can potentially take all the

583
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,320
ports that shouldn't be open on that

584
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,799
system and you can deflect those scans

585
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,280
off to a decoy environment

586
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,440
uh you can hide and deny access and that

587
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,600
one's a lot of fun and we're seeing this

588
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,360
more and more frequently where you hide

589
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,600
all the real credentials and you know

590
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,000
the only thing an attacker utilizing

591
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,760
their tools are going to find our decoy

592
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,760
credentials that alert you and again

593
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,240
lead them off into a decoy area

594
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,000
and the other piece that i really like

595
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,320
to harp on a lot is active directory

596
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,799
assessments i uh i did a

597
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,880
fireside chat yesterday in the united

598
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,919
states with the retail health uh ice ac

599
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,760
information sharing analysis center with

600
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,880
uh the chipotle you know uh uh cso so

601
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,640
who's well known used to be the the cso

602
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,480
for starbucks as well we talked

603
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,200
primarily about how active directory is

604
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,440
being ignored by many organizations out

605
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,919
there today on the security side so

606
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,799
doing an assessment to ensure that uh

607
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,880
active directory does not have

608
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,240
credentials that shouldn't be there

609
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,240
attack paths it shouldn't be there

610
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,640
cleaning it up and changing the

611
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,960
configuration to performance while

612
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,520
minimizing attack paths can be very very

613
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,840
beneficial so you can build all this

614
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,320
structure and much much more into

615
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,240
derailing those attacks

616
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,679
and i know i'm almost out of time here

617
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,039
so i'm going to move a little bit more

618
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,640
quickly because we we wanted to take

619
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,640
some questions so stopping attacks

620
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,640
really means understanding the attackers

621
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,960
i still have cesos i meet with sometimes

622
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,200
that say attribution doesn't matter it

623
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,960
does matter you you want to understand

624
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,640
who's attacking you and then you're

625
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,640
going to have a better chance to build

626
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,480
your instrumentation to defend those

627
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,919
high value assets inside your

628
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,840
environment so to do that you really

629
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,080
need visibility you know understanding

630
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,720
and reducing lateral movement paths a

631
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,159
lot of people aren't looking for that

632
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,120
they have

633
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,919
endpoints and cloud and they don't look

634
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,520
at those lateral movement paths across

635
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,960
the cloud or from the endpoint to the

636
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,360
cloud so it's important really to start

637
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,200
thinking about that whether you have an

638
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,799
on-premise environment with your own

639
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,200
active directory or some other identity

640
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,080
service but understand that structure

641
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,559
and instrument to look at lateral

642
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:51,760
movement paths

643
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,679
the big solar winds breach that took

644
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:54,880
place

645
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,120
so it took uh nine months to find that

646
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,120
you know and they are a security company

647
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,480
good one

648
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,480
and when you think about that there were

649
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,919
you know more than 100 companies

650
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,919
compromised and none of them found it

651
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,600
and again because people weren't looking

652
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,840
for lateral movement paths they weren't

653
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,159
cleaning it up and they weren't reducing

654
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,559
excessive entitlement identification

655
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,400
reduction you want to clean up that

656
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,000
attack surface that's critically

657
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,240
important before you're breached so

658
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,679
because that's going to help you you

659
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,760
know to uh strand that attacker when

660
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,520
they do get in and again assumption of

661
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,400
breach mentality is critical so clean up

662
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,120
those paths before the adversary gets in

663
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,360
reduce that attack surface and the last

664
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,000
one is attack prevention and detection

665
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,400
you know uh don't let them go into do

666
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,559
worries active directory update it give

667
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,640
a misdirection you know cloak your data

668
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,559
and encrypt it you know and implement

669
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,880
credential obfuscation and bait and

670
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,200
again same thing monitor for east west

671
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,679
lateral movement because people today

672
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,000
are not so we're seeing adversaries move

673
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,080
constantly inside an environment and

674
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,000
people don't have the instrumentation in

675
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,679
place to catch them they think i have

676
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,360
edr and i'm good

677
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,120
well we all know based on the headlines

678
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,799
we're not good with just edr there's a

679
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,480
lot more to it than that and i think

680
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,039
this audience knows that

681
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:09,919
so

682
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,080
in wrap up

683
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,080
writer's new engage and active defense

684
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,200
model really gives you opportunities to

685
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,360
engage the attackers inside your

686
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,480
enterprise

687
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,039
um so it's it's not letting them just go

688
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,720
through and trying to you know do

689
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,360
forensics on a system you know and find

690
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,720
out how they got in and where they got

691
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,799
in instead it's direct engagement with

692
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,960
the adversary inside your system and

693
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,320
putting up enough of enough obstacles

694
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,080
and hurdles where they're going to set

695
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,000
off alarms going to know very very

696
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,679
quickly what's going on so you can

697
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,240
mitigate that impact and they may never

698
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,520
get to the point where they could steal

699
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,279
data or even encrypt any systems

700
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,679
miter and nist are both recommending a

701
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,559
more active response to attacks so nist

702
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,720
is updated special publication 853 which

703
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,400
is the controls that feed the cyber

704
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,640
security framework and then mitre has

705
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,159
helped them with that as well as the

706
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,320
public talking about active defense and

707
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,520
engage is the next step up past that

708
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,279
be creative you can have a lot of fun

709
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,520
with us you know you can change the

710
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,120
outcome of attacks by preparing the

711
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,799
battlefield ahead of time and this this

712
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,039
is a battle we all know that so we get

713
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,200
hit on every day you know with attackers

714
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,200
trying to get inside our network

715
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,559
changing the structure of how that

716
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,559
network looks to the attacker without

717
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,880
impacting your operations is critically

718
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,120
important so you can have a tremendous

719
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,480
amount of fun by thinking about uh your

720
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,000
organization

721
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,400
what its goals are what it accomplishes

722
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,000
and then how you can you know uh

723
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,760
structure that that

724
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,360
framework so it doesn't impact

725
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,120
operations but it does impact the

726
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,520
adversary through you know an active

727
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,440
defense

728
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,600
use attack to understand gaps we all

729
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,320
have gaps in our defenses so that can

730
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,080
help you understand if this attacker

731
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,480
comes in and these are the ttps oh no i

732
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,960
have nothing here you know in this area

733
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,360
on this system to look for you know the

734
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,840
ttps for that actor you know that we

735
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,440
know they typically do that and i don't

736
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,120
have any instrumentation there so that

737
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,360
can help you fix that and of course the

738
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,159
engage for the act of defense as well

739
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,080
but understanding them is critical if

740
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,760
you if you wish to win this daily battle

741
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,320
engage was created for any type and size

742
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,000
of organization i've had a lot of people

743
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,440
ask me you know and i don't work for

744
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,000
mitre but ask me you know well you know

745
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,880
uh

746
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,960
my organization's only for security

747
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,640
people doesn't matter doesn't matter

748
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,240
there's lots you can do ahead of time

749
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,559
especially cleaning up active directory

750
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,799
and hiding credentials it's simple to do

751
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,760
and can have significant impact

752
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,279
so well uh

753
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,320
lucho gracias for your time and uh and i

754
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,760
will take uh take questions if we have

755
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,240
time for it

756
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,879
i i have a question for you tony

757
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,520
we can

758
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,679
we find we find very cool to work with

759
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,480
nasa how was your experience working

760
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,640
with them

761
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,120
it was fantastic you know

762
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,080
i really enjoyed my time with nasa and i

763
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,559
will tell you that the big problem for

764
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,399
if you consider yourself a geek like i

765
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,880
do was staying focused on thinking about

766
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,200
risk management you know instead of just

767
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,919
becoming completely overwhelmed trying

768
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,760
to understand all the scientists

769
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,080
technology that they're putting in place

770
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,240
the uh the astronauts you know you can

771
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,399
get very excited about you know

772
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,080
having conversations with them and the

773
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,760
experiences they've had

774
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,320
but it was tremendously fun for me i

775
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,399
absolutely had a blast working with nasa

776
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,720
so we'd go back in an instant you know

777
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,640
if they uh put the structure back in

778
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,640
place for that advisory council really

779
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,880
enjoyed it great great thank you

780
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,480
francisco te queria caracella

781
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,360
we have some questions here

782
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,600
just a minute

783
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,399
okay hi my name is francisco and i like

784
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,880
to know what what do you think about

785
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,120
public disclosure programs or book

786
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,080
bounty programs

787
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,240
well i like bounty programs a lot i

788
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,000
think they're important and really do

789
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,600
help our community so uh you know

790
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,240
when we have just an internal team

791
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,080
that's looking at our enterprise we

792
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,799
quite often miss things and having you

793
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,600
know responsible researchers out there

794
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,279
you know that are looking at your

795
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,520
technology can save us you know from

796
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,600
having a major compromise somewhere you

797
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,520
know so i i think that's critically

798
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,600
important especially for technology

799
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,480
companies you know to uh to engage with

800
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,880
the community talk to the community uh

801
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,840
build the program out so there's

802
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,310
well-defined parameters so we get

803
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,039
[Music]

804
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,760
an equitable process for the patch when

805
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,919
something is found so the researcher

806
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,840
gets credit for it but at the same time

807
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,360
and we get to patch out well ahead of

808
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,799
time i think it's critically important

809
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,760
as well i i don't like the researchers

810
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,760
you know that uh you know or cowboy like

811
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,679
in their approach where they will uh

812
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,600
just toss something out there you know

813
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,960
without working with the company which

814
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,559
potentially could you know end up in

815
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,159
compromise for a lot of people but i

816
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,679
think that that is really really

817
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,520
important you know to put bug bounty

818
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,520
programs in place for governments uh

819
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,360
large corporations and especially tech

820
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,159

821
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,840
great thank you tony

822
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,120
no no more question thank you so much

823
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,640
tony for your support we can hope that

824
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,600
you can come to chile maybe in the near

825

future

826
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,120
oh that would be fantastic so would

827
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,799
really enjoy that

828
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,200
