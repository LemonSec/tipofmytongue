2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,339
and we're back already in 8.8

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:08,069
juniors months I turned up the volume so much

4
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:09,389
hate that they themselves

5
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:11,040
definition deaf for people that I have a

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,019
good phone sorry to be more careful

7
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:14,549
with the audio record with what I

8
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:17,580
can divide a  sound or a gesture of

9
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,439
joy because we are back in the

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,260
last in the last we already have 8.8

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,380
junior opened the games of this of this

12
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,019
place the orchard who left the family

13
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,119
of the family the parents of catí sommer

14
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,170
who through the foundation

15
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,020
They obviously presented

16
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,210
their history, their story and the functions

17
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,950
that are dedicated today, after

18
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,170
their breeder came, it is that in a wonderful talk they

19
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,250
do not disregard all their

20
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,160
codes the work

21
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,140
Rocio Mieres on whether you go to security and

22
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:49,820
streamers sebastián just from the edge

23
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,590
that no  He was recently commenting and I am

24
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,290
talking to the cybersecurity envelope,

25
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:56,150
the commissioner in line who was also

26
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,980
there talking about things that still do not

27
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,780
seem to be having guided  or that they are

28
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,460
so obvious but that in reality he omits

29
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,059
daily on issues of knowing more about

30
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:06,860
digital hygiene and now to close,

31
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,810
we are just going to talk and this may

32
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:09,950
be a little more aimed at

33
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,320
teachers about what is coming

34
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,229
in education and precisely technology

35
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:18,680
for that  We have a whole Pablo

36
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,289
Cristian and he is the director of the

37
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,509
Native Digital Foundation, a foundation

38
00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:25,460
that has been working for so many years on this

39
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,500
transformation in this advance and that

40
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,149
we could say in this

41
00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:30,590
world historical process that has been called

42
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,090
many times as the fourth revolution

43
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,860
behind that  the one with the information

44
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,490
paulo, how are you doing

45
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:42,130
the dialogue and then he listens to me

46
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:44,830
and I listen to perfect jazz perfect how

47
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,380
are you?

48
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,270


49
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,220


50
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,689


51
00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:54,580
and girls had

52
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,530
been enjoying the talks yes

53
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,360
but more than him also from the

54
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,210
boys and  Little girls and little girls

55
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,649
we have precisely a lot of teacher who

56
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:04,210
was asking if the information from

57
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,470
these talks will be uploaded to YouTube,

58
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,060
they will be able to compare to leaving it to

59
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,380
share and talk with some

60
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,300
students there are many information that

61
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,319
we have revealed today that

62
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,910
is also dedicated  For example, to protocols

63
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,190
of professionals on the subject of

64
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,600
cyberbulling and

65
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,160
well that has meant that we have

66
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,440
just a lot, a lot of teachers, a lot of

67
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,140
teachers connected until now and I

68
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,580
'm going to leave them to you because I understand that

69
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,750
listening to it is going to talk about

70
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,780
revolution and education if you are

71
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,590
exactly

72
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,030
we are going to talk about the

73
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,459
digital revolution in education perfect the

74
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:36,160
study space I advanced it 8.8 juniors

75
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,840
garden

76
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,360
thank you very much I am going to share a

77
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,239
small presentation that I have

78
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:46,230
we are going to talk as I said there about the

79
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,120
digital revolution in education that

80
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,569
we are going to understand by this one of the

81
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:53,580
themes that we are showing today

82
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,190
is that the pandemic put us in a

83
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,129
A very new context and it is basically that

84
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:01,019
we had to start developing

85
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:04,410
skills that we had not

86
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,510
been developing in the last

87
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,540
20-30 years and what

88
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,340
is called the digital transformation of

89
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,569
education had been very slow and there was some resistance,

90
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:15,239
let's understand  a bit the context of

91
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:17,040
where we are and why we are talking

92
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,530
about the digital revolution in education and

93
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,540
then we are going to enter the toughest matter

94
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,730
which is basically how we take

95
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,849
charge in education environments of

96
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:28,560
this process of incorporation of

97
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,690
technologies and the ecosystem  digital

98
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,090
then let us first understand

99
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,320
what the digital ecosystem is and how

100
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,640
digital natives interact today

101
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,880
in this virtual space, the

102
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,140
first thing to understand is that

103
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,420
today there are or do not exist in the

104
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,920
virtual space four generations that have

105
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,810
technological appropriations of this

106
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,210
space  relatively different the

107
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,070
first are the baby boomers who are

108
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,810
how we could put it more  digits I

109
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,730
do not want to offend anyone with this but those

110
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,640
who are there like between the year 46 to the

111
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,300
year 65 of birth who basically

112
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,990
saw, for example, the emergence of

113
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,690
radio, color television, the

114
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,850
telephone came to our houses, generation

115
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,310
x evidence other historical moments  of

116
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,560
technological appropriation, such as

117
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,570
the arrival of color television,

118
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,120
the arrival of the computer in our

119
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,570
homes, but the new

120
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,830
generations, the millennials, and the generation of

121
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,050
digital natives, as millennials are known today,

122
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,450
for example, we saw the moment when

123
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,850
the internet arrived.  to our houses and

124
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,950
that moment in a wonderful moment

125
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,380
in which we could download a song of

126
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,030
only three minutes in almost three and a half hours

127
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,480


128
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,890
and that if they called you on the phone,

129
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,990
the communication was cut off and I lost what they

130
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,120
had downloaded, these types of problems

131
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,040
begin to  be corrected

132
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,600
as technology advances but

133
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,340
we are having different appropriation processes

134
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,950
and if there is at  Go that characterizes

135
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,200
the generation of digital natives are

136
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,820
two particular elements, the first is

137
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,030
that when technology was born, it was

138
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,520
allowing ubiquitous technologies to

139
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,290
expand basically the

140
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,750
technologies that have to do with

141
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,420
tablets, cell phones, notebooks,

142
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,130
laptops, all the tools that

143
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,780
could be  moved from one point to

144
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,400
another they were in a process of expansion

145
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,030
and the other thing was that wi-fi technology

146
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,460
was also expanding and here is

147
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,780
something interesting because many

148
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,220
digital natives we meet

149
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,810
when we are working in

150
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,940
schools and we ask them hear when they

151
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,130
create  You, who invented the internet and

152
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,110
the youngest 67-year-olds, how they

153
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,480
look, it survives like the world did not

154
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,330
come with the internet, like the big band did not

155
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,780
create the earth with the internet, and of course

156
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,850
what this shows is that there is

157
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,969
progress at work

158
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,129
mentally that children have had to do

159
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:50,189
to understand that basically

160
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:51,839
technology is something that  we have created

161
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:54,929
very recently and the technological access that

162
00:05:54,929 --> 00:05:57,269
boys and girls are having today and

163
00:05:57,269 --> 00:05:59,939
makes this process look like something

164
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:03,329
very, very established as if it had

165
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,129
come many years ago but the

166
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:06,449
truth is that no and today we are

167
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,599
seeing  that children under six years of age and

168
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:12,239
one in three is having access to at

169
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:13,949
least one device that allows them to

170
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:16,079
access the internet

171
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:18,479
then when they grow a little more

172
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,879
between 7 and 13 years we can observe that

173
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,959
one in two boys or girls or girls  He already

174
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,539
has a technological device that

175
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:29,909
allows him to access the internet and when we

176
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:31,529
go a little bit bigger today

177
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:34,289
in school the average and we can see

178
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:36,659
that almost all the students

179
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:38,309
have their own technological device

180
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:40,379
that allows them to access some

181
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:44,489
type of connectivity  either wifi or 3g or

182
00:06:44,489 --> 00:06:47,399
mobile as it is known and this begins to

183
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:49,769
generate certain peculiarities one of

184
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:51,689
the great questions that

185
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:53,580
those of us who come from the world are asking today  or

186
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,559
from the academy that we come from, we have been

187
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:57,929
studying these issues for a long time, it

188
00:06:57,929 --> 00:07:03,029
is good, we are literate, we are

189
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:05,669
despite the hyperconnectivity that we are

190
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:06,809
having, so we are going to do

191
00:07:06,809 --> 00:07:10,110
a little x-ray of where this

192
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,509
generation is, it is being done here and

193
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:15,059
here the element that jumps  In view,

194
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,899
which is probably the most evident, it

195
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:20,759
has to do with the fact that the device most

196
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:23,399
used by children and young people is

197
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:26,099
the cell phone, then there is

198
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:27,809
television, which has not decreased in the

199
00:07:27,809 --> 00:07:30,329
last 20 years from a consumption

200
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:33,659
close to 57 60 per cent.  A hundred later

201
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:35,639
are the computers that, precisely

202
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,739
with the pandemic, have begun to increase

203
00:07:37,739 --> 00:07:40,469
their usability, we will explain later

204
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:43,139
why and video games are in

205
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:44,789
a slightly more relegated place but they also

206
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:46,679
have an important participation,

207
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:48,659
basically what this shows is that

208
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:50,950
at

209
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,470
least the  The main devices that

210
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,520
boys and girls are

211
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,010
using today have to do with a technology

212
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,570
that  e can take anywhere and

213
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,460
this is very important to understand because

214
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,220
this generation understands

215
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,400
content consumption as first as consumption

216
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,820
then it understands it as consumption at their

217
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,560
disposal that can be at any

218
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,740
time at any time

219
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,900
anywhere from anywhere in the world

220
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,640
they can see they can see they can

221
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,010
participate in the content they

222
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,770
want then if we go a little to see

223
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,510
that what they are doing in these

224
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:28,920
devices the main thing is that they are

225
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,320
doing actions that today are

226
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,929
considered leisure, entertainment or

227
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:37,330
communication then we have to be

228
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:40,179
listening to music mainly watching

229
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:43,750
videos or participating in any of these

230
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,050
social networks that today are the most

231
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:50,420
required by them and they

232
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,910
when we leave a little more people

233
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,620
say, see, but what are the

234
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,389
social networks that are occupying more these

235
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:58,760
boys and girls whatsapp today  It is

236
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,670
by far the most widespread basically

237
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,880
because it is the space d  where there is greater

238
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,800
socialization where they communicate this is

239
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,750
probably evident it is more or less

240
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,220
transversal in almost all

241
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,660
generations

242
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,250
the penetration of whatsapp is

243
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,269
probably one of the

244
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:17,779
most important tools in the daily use of

245
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:19,579
the applications that we have on our

246
00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:22,430
mobile devices instagram is a space

247
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:25,190
that today generation z has been taken and

248
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,959
here is something interesting because

249
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,389
generation z starts off being on

250
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:31,820
facebook but little by little they are

251
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,820
moving to instagram migrating towards

252
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,010
a much more agile platform much more

253
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,139
entertaining for it and friends is

254
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:40,790
making the analogy that is  Like when

255
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,380
we agreed to be at the

256
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,230
parties of 15 and the parents of

257
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,880
the mistress of the house arrived and as they learned the

258
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,800
light and everything was as ture, hey

259
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,649
when these parents leave, how do you tell them

260
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:52,699
to leave for that life so that they can

261
00:09:52,699 --> 00:09:53,870
keep dancing because nobody wants to

262
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,520
dance where the

263
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,830


264
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,840
parents are

265
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,880
Children and the youngest begin to migrate

266
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,310
to a space where we are not

267
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:08,030
the old ways that we are seeing it

268
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:11,540
there their publications in practice

269
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,780
take this social network and the other

270
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,290
social network that has not stopped having a

271
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,660
very high participation of  consumption of

272
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,990
children between 8 and 18 years is YouTube and

273
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,490
here is something interesting that has to

274
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,710
do with the language that

275
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,660
boys and girls are using today

276
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,940
audiovisual language is by far the

277
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,220
most used language in

278
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,980
communication matters video him recording himself

279
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,050
sending  If you send a photo to send an audio,

280
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,120
everything that has to do with this

281
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,400
expression from the visual or from the

282
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,500
auditory are the languages that they are

283
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,910
using the most and here is something

284
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,590
interesting later we will see it

285
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,780
in more detail is that it

286
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,550
may probably interest you  to the teachers and this is what

287
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,010
they are doing on YouTube, one

288
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:58,280
of the elements that

289
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,960
children between 8 and 18 years old are most looking for in YouTube

290
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,090
tutorials and the tutorial  It has an

291
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,650
interesting peculiarity and that is that it

292
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:08,920
generates a learning process based

293
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,380
on experimentation, it seeks that

294
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,260
the child will be something after

295
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,690
observing this video and here we are going to

296
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,040
talk a little later

297
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,110
about the methodologies and not now

298
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,330
in  pedagogical subject, if there is something we

299
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,820
can do, it is to use the

300
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,010
flipped classroom methodology based

301
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:29,290
on these tutorials, as technology

302
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,930
is an impulse for the learning experience to

303
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,420
finally develop in

304
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,300
the analogous space where

305
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,630
boys and girls are living together today but

306
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,300
We were talking about how they are super connected

307
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,000
and indeed we have almost three out of

308
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,490
every four children confess that the

309
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,649


310
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:52,899
last thing they do before going to sleep

311
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:55,449
is to check their cell phone and the

312
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:58,149
first thing they do when they wake up is to

313
00:11:58,149 --> 00:12:00,670
check their cell phone and this is what

314
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,499
they don't  is graphing that there is a

315
00:12:02,499 --> 00:12:05,290
need there is one and there is an impulse to

316
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,209
want to want to be connected

317
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:09,579
always gri  ngo now they have just

318
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:12,550
launched a study that talks about a

319
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:15,369
new and a new type of risk

320
00:12:15,369 --> 00:12:17,740
that has to do with what is called fear

321
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,929
of missing out, which is basically like

322
00:12:19,929 --> 00:12:23,259
being afraid of missing something like if

323
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:25,869
I'm not connected, yourta already be

324
00:12:25,869 --> 00:12:28,540
losing something super important and of course

325
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,670
when you go to bed like the last thing I

326
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,679
wanted to see is I'm not losing

327
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:35,410
anything I'm going to sleep and then they

328
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,760
wake up

329
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,820
I didn't miss anything because well that

330
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,350
kind of sensations we're going to

331
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,120
understand from to

332
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,890
little throughout this conversation because

333
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,210
they begin to be generated but in

334
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:49,120
practice we have highly

335
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,940
connected subjects the average use of boys and

336
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,650
girls between 8 and 18 years old there are

337
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,840
approximately eight hours of screens

338
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,850
exposure to screen

339
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,150
this adds to the screens television

340
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,860
computer  cell phone tablet but

341
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,080
if you realize it is about a third

342
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,270
of the lives of boys and

343
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,670
girls today is in the

344
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,040
digital space on the screens and  so it is

345
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,740
relevant to understand because it is a fact

346
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,600
of the cause and we have to see in what

347
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,550
way we coexist adequately in this

348
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,650
space and how we take advantage of the

349
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,750
opportunities that this space opens for

350
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,670
pedagogical or informative processes

351
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,820
and we reduce the risks today here is

352
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,220
something  interesting because if there is something that

353
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,500
we begin to show in the

354
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,940
behavior of the boys and

355
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,240
girls it is that they are,

356
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,560
I do not know if it is without the innocent but very very

357
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,600
credulous of the digital space,

358
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,930
basically almost 78 percent believe the

359
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:50,410
internet is a safe place 60

360
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:52,390
percent  declares that everything that is on the

361
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:55,990
internet is true that is, we have a

362
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,540
belief that the internet is a

363
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:02,740
safe place and you will see very high in children between 8

364
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,850
and 18 years old and 76 percent assure that

365
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:09,100
their data is safe the truth

366
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,810
is that  They are not afraid and here

367
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,850
something much more delicate begins to appear, for

368
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,770
example, we have probably already

369
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,959
been seeing this with what

370
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,839
the summer foundation and him did

371
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,430
of cybercrime from life

372
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,660
[Music]

373
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,259
what is basically the large number of

374
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:31,519
boys and girls who today

375
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,709
accept unknown accounts on

376
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:35,600
social networks and who also have their

377
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,370
public accounts on social networks therefore

378
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,740
what this is showing is that

379
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,649
beyond  Being a highly connected generation, they

380
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:45,529
are a generation with low

381
00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:48,680
skills or low risk perception

382
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,870
of the digital space and that is where

383
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,339
some of the first problems begin to appear

384
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:54,889
because what we are

385
00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:57,680
observing is that the actions that

386
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,879
boys and girls are taking

387
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:00,410
in the

388
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:03,199
Today the digital world is exclusively oriented to

389
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,870
leisure, entertainment and communication,

390
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,209
watching videos, playing online, sharing

391
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:11,480
photos, music, doing actions that

392
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,509
are ultimately in socialization

393
00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:18,170
or entertainment, but there are not many

394
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,449
actions that have to do with

395
00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:23,360
functional or productive actions, such

396
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,699
as  example work or study that has

397
00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:27,769
been something that the pandemic has put us  or

398
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:30,019
in evidence

399
00:15:30,019 --> 00:15:33,619
then something appears here because

400
00:15:33,619 --> 00:15:35,889
we want

401
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:51,079
yes yes yes

402
00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:55,990
and then

403
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,930
normally I graph this is the power

404
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:01,600
of likes with one with a scene

405
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,730
when I am doing these seminars

406
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,260
this talk or when we are in the

407
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,120
team working I like to take a

408
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,120
photo and  upload it to my instagram I have

409
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,700
the dream of being an integramed and the

410
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,570
truth is that it has not gone very well for me

411
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:16,480
I have about 27 exteriors I think they are

412
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,620
my best friends and my last cousins

413
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,810
but I want to go back to

414
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,420
instagram so I upload this photo and

415
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,839
shortly after uploading the photo,

416
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:31,600
I usually receive a like from my mother,

417
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,649
whom I asked to do an

418
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:36,160
instagram to follow me and I

419
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,190
feel happy, I am very excited and

420
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,480
because of the algorithms that you will already

421
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,420
understand a little  later if my

422
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,810
mother gave me that like

423
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:49,000
normally my aunt is born a light too

424
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,800
because I already don't like 2 little heart a

425
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,610
lot of gratification and I feel very

426
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,220
happy and if my aunt is on that  Maybe a day

427
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,780
that I don't put a comment that

428
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,880
says no, as I wanted in my little boy, how

429
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,200
beautiful what he does, go ahead

430
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,150
or something like that then I get much

431
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,790
more excited and social networks basically

432
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,579
understood what these

433
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:11,920
little hearts and these messages generate  Very

434
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,930
early they understood that what they

435
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,339
are doing there is positive reinforcement

436
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:17,109
and human learning processes

437
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,790
have historically been based

438
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,619
on positive reinforcement if

439
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,510
you notice when they give a test

440
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,970
for example and get a good grade,

441
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,619
positive reinforcement is activated and

442
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:28,600
what is activated and a

443
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,730
neurotransmitter called dopamine and that basically what

444
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,220
it does is activate your brain to

445
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,590
tell you you know that you have to do

446
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,600
this again then

447
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,390
a kind of virtuous circle

448
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:43,270
in learning begins to be generated in which  dopamine

449
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,600
mobilizes this learning process but

450
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,430
unfortunately social networks and

451
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:51,370
video games have understood this logic of

452
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:51,790
how  or

453
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,100
in the brain and they give us what are called

454
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,860
false rewards and those

455
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,190
false rewards make us

456
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:03,460
inadvertently want to be stuck in social networks

457
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,840
and video games

458
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,700
, therefore basically what video games are

459
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,780
doing

460
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,880
is deceiving our  brain

461
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,580
and that is super relevant because we have

462
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,590
to be aware of this we have

463
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,240
to realize that what we are

464
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,370
doing by being on social networks

465
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,950
is giving them our time and

466
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,570
giving them our data,

467
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:25,900
probably this we are going to analyze in

468
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,630
greater depth but the great business

469
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,450
of  social networks and

470
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,450
videogames is to obtain our data and

471
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:37,810
profile our data in such a way as to be

472
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:41,170
able to say who I am good Pablo

473
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,930
likes mineral water Pablo

474
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,690
likes to go on vacation to the tav or Pablo

475
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:50,170
likes to travel by bus and so on  a

476
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,210
profiling that they then sell to

477
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:55,210
different service providers who

478
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,220
basically want to get your

479
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,480
information  In order to be able

480
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,549
to provide you with some kind of direct service,

481
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:04,210
this brings some risks and I

482
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,100
know that you have probably seen this

483
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:10,179
with the lord of the pdi chairs

484
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:12,400
but it is relevant to understand that there is a

485
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,770
high degree of victimization today as a

486
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:17,290
result of what is happening  in

487
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,450
this virtual space because basically

488
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,940
what we want is to compete for

489
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,919
likes and here one of the figures that for

490
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,809
me is the most relevant of all is that

491
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:29,679
the largest number of cases of victims in

492
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,740
the virtual space is of women and that

493
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:36,549
shows us that  We are repeating something

494
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:39,130
that happens in the analog world also

495
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,049
in virtual space and it is very delicate

496
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:43,710
but one of the relevant things that

497
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,570
this figure shows is that of this 80

498
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:47,770
percent of victims who are

499
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,049
mainly women, a

500
00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:53,679
large part of this number is made

501
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,070
up of women  who have been attacked in

502
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,429
virtual space by other women and this

503
00:20:00,429 --> 00:20:02,230
is super worrying because if we are

504
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:04,280
seeing something it

505
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,830
is extremely relevant what it has to do

506
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,810
with  n the emergence of

507
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:12,020
feminist movements that seek to deliver equality

508
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:18,260
and equity in the development of those of

509
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:22,070
society based on those of gender protectors,

510
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:25,370
what we cannot allow ourselves is

511
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,440
that women are attacking

512
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,270
each other and because they are doing it

513
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,890
because there is  a kind of competition for

514
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,930
the stereotype basically what is

515
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:35,390
happening is that we have a

516
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,640
beautiful woman in social networks to which

517
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,880
we aspire to be and if we are not we suffer

518
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,790
permanent attacks you are ugly you are fat

519
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:46,730
you are a girl you are tall what

520
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:50,150
matters and is diminishing  your self-esteem and

521
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,430
finally one of the main

522
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,650
risks that today we begin to observe in

523
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:57,560
the virtual space has to do with the

524
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,870
self-esteem of the user how the

525
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,750
user begins to create a

526
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,240
virtual avatar a digital avatar in which he

527
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,950
begins to say I am this

528
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:10,440
but in  the practice inside is

529
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,929
not necessarily and that is something very

530
00:21:12,929 --> 00:21:14,760
worrying that we are beginning to

531
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,309
observe the main risks that

532
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:20,309
I want to

533
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:21,960
mention them as an umbrella because

534
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,029
we are going to go into details about

535
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:26,370
how we can basically address it.The

536
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,570
main risks observed in

537
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,860
the educational community have to do

538
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,500
with cyberbullying, which is harassment

539
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,149
through platforms.  digital have

540
00:21:33,149 --> 00:21:34,919
some particular elements such as for

541
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,980
example that it remains forever that it can

542
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,710
be anonymous which can be through a

543
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,149
virtual space that can be

544
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:43,500
seen by many people

545
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,139
therefore the sexting that has to do

546
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,760
with the exchange of

547
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,470
erotic content and here I am going to tell you something

548
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,970
that has particular interest

549
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:54,570
and there we do some workshops of

550
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:56,760
digital leaders in different schools

551
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,760
in Chile and a while ago one of

552
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,120
these workshops was in a girls' high school and

553
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,950
the girls talked about  they

554
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,960
said good sexting but I even

555
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,970
like to take my photo and send it to my

556
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,639
boyfriend and how to have a wave with that l

557
00:22:11,639 --> 00:22:12,840
The packs knotted

558
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,110
and what they told us was like,

559
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,820
maybe what we have to do is make

560
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,370
recommendations so that the girls

561
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:22,080
who want to take photos have

562
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,059
precautions so what they did

563
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:28,590
was a group of confessions within

564
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:32,150
the school that is for classmates and

565
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,880
friends in which they basically made

566
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,190
recommendations of nuts and safe packs

567
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,049
then they told them not to take photos

568
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:42,900
with a tattoo or with the

569
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,610
school insignia or with some place where they can

570
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,080
identify where they are and things

571
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,690
like that I find interesting is that

572
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:50,730
new look  Of sexting because

573
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,799
unfortunately what we were today the

574
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,539
interactions between boy and

575
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,980
girl between girls

576
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,830
and is happening in this formula and what we

577
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,870
lived we need to privilege is

578
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:04,600
self-care, then there is grooming that

579
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,190
we have heard a lot about this topic in

580
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,140
fact recently I was speaking in

581
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,360
various means for a very particular case

582
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,380
of the kidnapping of a girl by an

583
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,330
adult and this occupies  rre through

584
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,309
social networks this type of situation

585
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:19,690
is happening a lot

586
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,669
in fact for night today is a platform

587
00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:25,360
in which we have one of the

588
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,490
highest grooming cases and finally there

589
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,620
are addictions addictions today

590
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,929
are on an escalation especially because

591
00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:33,730
somehow we have not known how to get

592
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:36,700
along adequately in the limits

593
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:40,450
versus providing an adequate virtual space

594
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:43,270
and that is the role that

595
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,100
adults have is fundamental we are going to talk

596
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,130
a little about how that is evidenced

597
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,630
then basically what

598
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,070
we propose in this

599
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:53,110
digital transformation of  education is that you have to

600
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,970
pass from these your

601
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:58,150
intuitive skills that state that the way to

602
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,530
enter the platforms is

603
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:01,540
absolutely only intuitive, everything will

604
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,169
be able

605
00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:04,539
to achieve a judicious usability that

606
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:06,309
can be a usability that will be

607
00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:08,470
guided accompanied by

608
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:11,499
somehow a guide or a

609
00:24:11,499 --> 00:24:13,419
containment in moments of risk to

610
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:17,139
pass from the us  passive uses

611
00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:19,600
that are exclusively oriented to

612
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,999
entertainment and socialization and

613
00:24:21,999 --> 00:24:24,700
move towards productive uses

614
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,769
work studying studying seeking information

615
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:29,919
moving from basic

616
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,289
skills to complex skills that

617
00:24:32,289 --> 00:24:33,909
we are observing today of having to

618
00:24:33,909 --> 00:24:36,399
generate, for example, google forms  In order

619
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:37,739
to respond to being able to do tests, we

620
00:24:37,739 --> 00:24:41,259
have to go through the presentations

621
00:24:41,259 --> 00:24:44,799
that before we made a flipchart and

622
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,080
pasted it on the blackboard or we used

623
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,629
the blackboard as a kind of mural

624
00:24:49,629 --> 00:24:51,429
today we have to start playing canvas

625
00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:53,379
we have to start occupying the mural

626
00:24:53,379 --> 00:24:54,730
we have to start playing other

627
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:55,749
tools that somehow

628
00:24:55,749 --> 00:24:58,509
require certain more

629
00:24:58,509 --> 00:25:01,299
complex competences and the same after moving

630
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:03,429
from analog

631
00:25:03,429 --> 00:25:05,200
skills to digital skills and how to do them

632
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,190
with playing

633
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:09,029
so that we can have a space for

634
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:11,889
pedagogical development development of

635
00:25:11,889 --> 00:25:14,649
the teaching-learning process  that

636
00:25:14,649 --> 00:25:17,169
permanently transits between him  or

637
00:25:17,169 --> 00:25:19,629
analog and digital, not that

638
00:25:19,629 --> 00:25:21,549
analog does not take all the force and that

639
00:25:21,549 --> 00:25:22,690
digital does not take all the force

640
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:25,600
basically that they are complementary and

641
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,409
finally move from

642
00:25:28,409 --> 00:25:31,000
instructional methodologies to innovative methodologies

643
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,210
and here is probably the

644
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:36,309
key to the challenges we have  From

645
00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:37,870
the point of view of education, in

646
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,419
order to transform ourselves adequately,

647
00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:42,279
we do not get anything by incorporating technology

648
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:43,690
to incorporate technologies,

649
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:46,330
technology alone does not do anything,

650
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,399
what matters is how we incorporate it in

651
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:50,200
the teaching-learning process, how we

652
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,490
incorporate it in the pedagogical process

653
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,500
so that we incorporate it so that we

654
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,899
use it and there the key is the

655
00:25:55,899 --> 00:25:57,879
methodologies and the methodology but now

656
00:25:57,879 --> 00:25:59,679
as learning you are going to a project

657
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,389
learning based on a network or learning

658
00:26:01,389 --> 00:26:03,399
based on challenge flipped classroom

659
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:06,330
gamification are key because they are

660
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,679
methodologies that allow the

661
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:11,500
proper incorporation of the  technology

662
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,620
and we are going to enter an already

663
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:16,300
exclusive topic  Mind of the pedagogical challenge that we

664
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,520
finally face from the

665
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,130
educational point of view in this new

666
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:22,270
digital context,

667
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,460
the first thing is to understand that there is a great

668
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:28,990
gap and a gap that is in

669
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:31,420
usability first and then the competences

670
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,550
there is a gap between teachers and

671
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,010
students regarding  how long

672
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:39,340
have we been connected and what have we

673
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:42,460
been connected for and on the other hand there is

674
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,770
a new vision of

675
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,590
pedagogical processes what was understood by

676
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:51,010
education 50 years ago today does not apply

677
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,860
we have to transform those processes and

678
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,050
one of the elements that

679
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,880
we have been motivating since  It is a long

680
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,040
time ago that this transformation occurred

681
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:03,400
from the methodological transformation of

682
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,590
the teaching-learning processes and

683
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,860
here then what competencies should

684
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,500
educators develop in this

685
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:15,120
21st century in this era of connectivity

686
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,920
first understand that

687
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,470
our role today is to be a

688
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,780
apprentice teacher and this is very interesting

689
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,630
because it changes the logic a bit  of that

690
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:27,670
teacher who stood in front of the students

691
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:30,390
and told them to write what I dictate to them,

692
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:33,340
understand what I tell them, answer

693
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,980
the test as I want them to answer me,

694
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,260
and what this new methodology proposes

695
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:42,370
is that we consider ourselves as teachers who

696
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,860
want to be  learning in the same

697
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:47,530
process that we are teaching in fact

698
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:50,850
now recently I heard that the

699
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,840
economy between the

700
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,760
teaching-learning process now speaks of

701
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,310
learning-learning because even

702
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,370
the teacher to the extent that he is

703
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:02,830
teaching is also learning and there are

704
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,840
fundamental elements they have to do

705
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,880
with  the investigation and the

706
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,100
permanent update for many years we

707
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,830
could observe that there was a

708
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:13,330
resistance to that investigation and to that

709
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:16,090
update today not today the pandemic

710
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,380
put us in a territory of what we have

711
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,910
called the forced digital transformation

712
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:22,850
basically moves us

713
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:25,130
to a space in which we do not  we had

714
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,170
resisted and when we got there

715
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:28,670
we realized that it was not so serious no er

716
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:31,550
so difficult then what we do is to

717
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,840
appropriate this process of

718
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,000
permanent updating, something very

719
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,560
important with permanent assessment

720
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,540
with colleagues and with

721
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,820
students to improve

722
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,400
pedagogical practices this is key if

723
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,490
we do not work in collaboration we will not be

724
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,080
able to improve practices  of this

725
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,850
course because pedagogical practice

726
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,790
is not improved by doing things we only

727
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,050
basically need

728
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:55,970
interdisciplinary work collaborative work

729
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:58,280
that allows this set of

730
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,740
actions that are developed in the

731
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,020
teaching-learning process and can be

732
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:06,050
implemented throughout the

733
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:09,680
educational community, leading educators basically

734
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,080
have to  advocate for the exactor the

735
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,720
equitable access of technologies and

736
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,100
digital content and here there is a

737
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,080
tremendous challenge that the pandemic has

738
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,660
made in evidence not all and all of us

739
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,960
have the same conditions for

740
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,450
technological access therefore

741
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:28,669
educators have to be able to lead

742
00:29:28,669 --> 00:29:31,039
those  process  s they have to be able to define

743
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,070
how we are going to face this process that is

744
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,289
coming now that is we are going to enter a

745
00:29:36,289 --> 00:29:38,330
hybrid system probably during

746
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:41,149
this second semester and probably the

747
00:29:41,149 --> 00:29:43,039
first semester of next year and

748
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,749
we will return to face-to-face the

749
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:47,419
important thing here is not to lose everything that

750
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:49,730
We win in terms of learning and

751
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,080
incorporating digital skills and

752
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,549
abilities to continue

753
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:54,830
using it because basically what

754
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:58,070
this allows us to do is to be better

755
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,230
teachers in terms of delivering

756
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:03,019
pedagogical processes but also to have

757
00:30:03,019 --> 00:30:06,049
more time and a higher quality of life because if

758
00:30:06,049 --> 00:30:07,970
there is something that allows us  digital solutions

759
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:11,389
is, for example, having to occupy

760
00:30:11,389 --> 00:30:13,669
less of our time in planning,

761
00:30:13,669 --> 00:30:15,529
occupying less of our time in

762
00:30:15,529 --> 00:30:17,690
evaluation 2 in formative evaluations

763
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,369
and even in the process of teacher evaluation in

764
00:30:19,369 --> 00:30:20,690


765
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:22,999
career 200 there are a series of

766
00:30:22,999 --> 00:30:25,249
elements that allow us to alleviate

767
00:30:25,249 --> 00:30:27,799
our workload in  the extent to

768
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:29,299
which we are incorporating technologies

769
00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:31,489
c  As something permanent, even if we return

770
00:30:31,489 --> 00:30:33,080
to face-to-face,

771
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,180
provide various

772
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,440
teaching-learning opportunities and this is

773
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:40,220
essential, not all of us learn the same, not

774
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,260
all of our students are the same,

775
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,030
some have faster

776
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,000
processes, other slower processes, have

777
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,950
skills and competencies, different

778
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:50,330
environments and different contexts, so

779
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:52,360
so much so that we have to be increasingly

780
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,650
adaptable to be able to

781
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,630
adequately lead the

782
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,400
teaching-learning processes

783
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,930
we have to be digital citizens and

784
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:01,820
here is something very important as we

785
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,830
participate responsibly and

786
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:06,140
empathically in this digital world as

787
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,210
we teach our students that

788
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:11,510
digital empathy is fundamental to

789
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,850
to be able to coexist and coexist properly

790
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:16,430
in the digital ecosystem, how can we

791
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:18,470
put ourselves in the place of the other and say

792
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:22,580
you know that if I say fat ugly to this

793
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,310
colleague, he will probably feel

794
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:28,700
affected and if he feels affected in the

795
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,400
community he will immediately be affected.

796
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,220
Therefore, we promote the development

797
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,350
of digital well-being, we have

798
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:38,180
plans that we have been developing since

799
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,210
2015,

800
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:42,820
and we have implemented in more than 500

801
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,040
schools throughout Chile with

802
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,950
more than 885 thousand students and about

803
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:51,010
5,000 teachers trained in digital well-being

804
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:53,710
that  It is basically how we put

805
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:56,560
the well-being of people

806
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,620
above development and how we make

807
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,450
this process of digital transformation compatible

808
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,820
from the point of view of the well-being

809
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,620
of people,

810
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,290
teachers, designers and experience analysts,

811
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:09,790
and here this is super

812
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,890
important,

813
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:14,140
meaningful learning experiences occur

814
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,470
when they are well motivated well

815
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,930
motivated and here I always become

816
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:22,360
very mature in this for my things a say

817
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,430
hello to the teacher humberto maturana who

818
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,930
has taught us so much but basically

819
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:30,490
what made it clear to us is that the way to

820
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,970
learn is to have stimuli that

821
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:35,950
motivate learning  and what

822
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,750
we propose is that educators today

823
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,880
They have to understand that they must

824
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,460
develop educational proposals that

825
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,500
can be created in digital environments

826
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,500
but that can also be

827
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,710
developed

828
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:50,320
in analogous spaces, basically you

829
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,140
can generate an impulse or a

830
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:56,460
motivation in the space to synchronous or

831
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,860
synchronous in the digital space and then

832
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,650
go to the space  analogous to

833
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:04,420
developing the experience, therefore

834
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:07,270
what we seek is that the learning experience

835
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,750


836
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:12,140
from the digital to the analog and that

837
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,240
in the analog this

838
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,330
significant learning experience is materialized,

839
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,610
basically also to be able to be

840
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:22,910
permanently analyzing the data that

841
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:25,630
allows you to be generating

842
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:28,580
consistent improvements  and permanent in your

843
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,530
teaching-learning process and basically

844
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:33,290
understand that today educational communities

845
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:36,800
have a context, they have

846
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,170
different knowledge, they come with

847
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:41,360
different tools and that all that

848
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,090
has to make sense also with the

849
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,650
reality and the context that we are

850
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,690
living today we are going through a

851
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:50,600
pro  constituent process there is a process that

852
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,810
is generating modifications in

853
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:56,510
education we have a context in which

854
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,100
for the first time we are talking about a

855
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,740
multinational country of a country that

856
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,410
welcomes gender diversity that welcomes

857
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:07,130
same-sex marriage, that is,

858
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,840
we have a  series of transformations

859
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,940
that are taking place and education

860
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,879
also has to properly situate

861
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,449


862
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:18,079
the contexts, finally what we

863
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,969
have to understand today is that we have the

864
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:23,750
possibility of transitioning from being

865
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,879
digital facilitators that are those

866
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:28,339
adults who deliver technology as

867
00:34:28,339 --> 00:34:30,349
if they were babysitters  digital or digital educators

868
00:34:30,349 --> 00:34:32,719
and what generates that is having

869
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,099
a digital orphan

870
00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:35,719
basically someone who has not been

871
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,190
accompanied in their process of

872
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:39,469
incorporation into the technological world at the

873
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:41,659
other end are the

874
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:43,460
digital limiters those who flatly refuse

875
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,199
technology

876
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,849
technology will  going back fools is

877
00:34:46,849 --> 00:34:49,668
going to take away their neurons, they are going to have

878
00:34:49,668 --> 00:34:52,668
these  Dopamine explosions and

879
00:34:52,668 --> 00:34:53,810
therefore they can never learn it, a

880
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:57,440
lie, everything can be done if it

881
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,900
agrees with a good balance to a

882
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,490
good balance.

883
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,890


884
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:05,869


885
00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:08,359
You

886
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:10,640
will enter the digital space early but with

887
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,849
conditions and competencies that did not

888
00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:14,810
occur in the

889
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:16,670
socialization process that

890
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:20,810
your peers or colleagues were developing, which is what

891
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:21,710


892
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,750
the digital radio foundation is

893
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,570
proposing. Let's transform digital mentors into digital mentors. Let's be the ones

894
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:28,849
who guide the incorporation process.

895
00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:31,130
to the technological world we are those who

896
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,810
take advantage of the opportunities

897
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:35,540
that digital and technological tools open up

898
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,130
in the

899
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:38,810
teaching-learning processes and in that way

900
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:41,990
we will have digital heirs how

901
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,160
we do that in the digital native foundation

902
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,290
we do it in three stages the

903
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:47,750
first  it is awareness that

904
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:49,550
we are doing now talking about  re

905
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,589
the topic to understand what are the

906
00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:52,940
themes that

907
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,050
boys and girls are having in the digital world

908
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:54,589


909
00:35:54,589 --> 00:35:55,910
what is the language they are occupying

910
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,710
know what a pac means and what

911
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:00,830
a knot means then move to a

912
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:03,560
stage of digital literacy that is

913
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,180
at the moment in  that we acquire

914
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,190
competencies and skills that

915
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:09,020
allow us to use technologies and

916
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,970
get the most out of our

917
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:13,730
daily tasks and finally enter

918
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:16,430
a stage of digital mentoring, which is

919
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:19,460
when we are prepared to get

920
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,260
the most out of technologies

921
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,030
from a productive point of view from

922
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,700
from the functional point of view and we

923
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,740
reduce to a minimum those

924
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,600
to which we are subjected as

925
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,850
an educational community in the

926
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:34,400
digital space due to the different

927
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,650
socialization and coexistence actions that

928
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:39,680
we have, that is our fault that it happened

929
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,170
so quickly but I wanted to be able to

930
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:44,030
tell you everything  this because we believe

931
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,430
that it is very important that all of

932
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,830
us go to  In this process of

933
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,630
digital transformation, if you have

934
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,880
any questions, welcome I love to

935
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,130
answer questions and if you have

936
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,230
any information regarding what we

937
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,760
are doing in digital natives, you

938
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,250
can enter our website or

939
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,170
follow our social networks and in

940
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:04,970
some way we will be talking

941
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:07,520
And helping them in their

942
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,470
digital transformation processes, thank you very much,

943
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,810
as I was saying, this

944
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:20,880
digital transformation process is very important

945
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,370
for all the communities.

946
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:26,880
This year we have worked with more than 3,500

947
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,070
teachers throughout Chile and one of

948
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,780
the most important elements that we have

949
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,900
seen is that the teachers have left behind

950
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:38,190
the resistance they had in the past

951
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,920
regarding technology and that is already

952
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,720
very positive they are understanding that

953
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,480
we can do things that we can learn

954
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,280
to use technologies in a

955
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,870
positive way and today what we are

956
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,850
promoting is that  do not get

957
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:52,650
lost when we return to the

958
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:55,140
presence

959
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,970
what inter  At the point of not

960
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:59,910
losing or trying to rescue precisely

961
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,560
the positive elements that it has allowed

962
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,240
or that have agreed, especially in the

963
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,680
pandemic period, you yourself were

964
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,300
commenting on it, we will see a time comes when

965
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,770
we are going to make a hybrid medium format

966
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:10,650
later not  We know that it is coming, we have

967
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:13,080
commented a lot on an article on

968
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,670
economics where it talks about how it will be

969
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,680
exactly or how this future is going to be

970
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:21,060
this new, this new idea of reality

971
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,620
that we are going to go after the pandemic and

972
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,270
everything you mentioned is precisely

973
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:26,310
what is expected to happen

974
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:29,430
precisely is a bit of an enchanted song it

975
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:32,570
would be terrible if we played

976
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:35,520
with him to see if everyone already

977
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,570
visualized it at least

978
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:41,330
effectively yes I think there is something

979
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:44,330
that is evident in this in this  A process

980
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:46,100
that we have had to experience as a

981
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,960
forced digital transformation that is not

982
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,310
only being experienced in education, we

983
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,600
are living it as a society,

984
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,340
we are seeing it, the company is seeing it.  What is

985
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,750
being seen by public organizations

986
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,040
we are now advising a

987
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,750
series of public organizations in their

988
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:59,030
digital transformation process

989
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,760
from culture, the great challenge we

990
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,430
have is how culture permeates this

991
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:06,660


992
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,700
perfect digital transformation process on the same we are opening

993
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,680
the space for  that they begin to ask

994
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,290
questions in the chat of the transmission

995
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:14,640
through paz line through our

996
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,440
social networks

997
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,770
828 so that they can follow us on instagram on

998
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:22,050
twitter and also so that they can

999
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:22,950
post how direct we are

1000
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,180
transmitting for all

1001
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,010
platforms through youtube  There are also

1002
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:27,180
questions in the youtube chat and

1003
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,910
you can also reach it through the

1004
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:31,560
8.8 computer security conference on

1005
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,710
facebook and precisely the first

1006
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:38,130
questions come from the field from the

1007
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:39,600
field of teaching they ask me here

1008
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,970
how much visuality virtuality affects education

1009
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:44,630


1010
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:48,440
sorry virtuality

1011
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,090
the virtuality to see

1012
00:39:53,999 --> 00:39:57,209
the virtuality understood  As the

1013
00:39:57,209 --> 00:39:59,489
learning process mediated through a

1014
00:39:59,489 --> 00:40:03,479
computer, it is not that it has affected but

1015
00:40:03,479 --> 00:40:08,429
that it required a modification, which is

1016
00:40:08,429 --> 00:40:11,909
what happened at the beginning when

1017
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,699
almost all the teachers were sent to quarantine for the first time,

1018
00:40:14,699 --> 00:40:17,189
what we did was transfer

1019
00:40:17,189 --> 00:40:19,469
the same class that we did  in

1020
00:40:19,469 --> 00:40:22,919
person to try to do it by zoom

1021
00:40:22,919 --> 00:40:25,230
or by nit

1022
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:28,680
and we were left with the mud because what

1023
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,109
happened there was that there was no

1024
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:34,890
classroom experience basically when

1025
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,890
you are in a face-to-face space you

1026
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:39,690
have the classroom experience you can

1027
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:41,250
share with the students you can

1028
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,230
Seeing everyone's faces can be

1029
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,180
seeing the reactions they have and

1030
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:49,950
basically you understand that process as

1031
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:53,460
a permanent collective process what happens

1032
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,040
when we go to the virtual space

1033
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,470
when we try to transfer the same

1034
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:00,510
class that we did in person to

1035
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:03,420
the virtual space does not work then

1036
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,740
what is  what we had to start

1037
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,380
making certain modifications

1038
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:10,290
to first see the exposure time  tion

1039
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:12,180
that we had to have in the

1040
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,190
virtual space, for example, one of the things that

1041
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:15,840
we are promoting today is that the

1042
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,470
classes, since they are done

1043
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:21,630
synchronously through the platform, do not last more

1044
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:24,540
than 45 minutes.

1045
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,820


1046
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,830
children with the camera on for

1047
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:30,990
longer than that there are many who claim

1048
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:31,880
to do

1049
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,039
with the camera off many times that

1050
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:35,720
you have to understand the context of

1051
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,460
children there are many who are just

1052
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,839
connecting with the phone that has

1053
00:41:38,839 --> 00:41:42,829
mobile technology and hopefully  It is

1054
00:41:42,829 --> 00:41:44,660
shared with two or three other children in

1055
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:47,509
the house, so they will not necessarily

1056
00:41:47,509 --> 00:41:50,599
want to be showing that intimacy and

1057
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:52,789
basically what they begin to see is a

1058
00:41:52,789 --> 00:41:55,819
transition to this virtual space that

1059
00:41:55,819 --> 00:41:59,119
often reveals that we were not

1060
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:01,940
taking care of the context on the one hand

1061
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:04,849
the context and reality of both

1062
00:42:04,849 --> 00:42:07,430
educators and learners and, on the other

1063
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:09,200
hand,

1064
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,720
we had not taken charge of generating

1065
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,610
modification processes  n methodological

1066
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:16,190
because finally at the root of the

1067
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:17,840
problem of why the class turned out for us

1068
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,700
when we went from face-to-face

1069
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,410
to virtuality was because the methodology

1070
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:23,810
does not apply to the virtual world so

1071
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:25,280
what we had to start doing was

1072
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,680
start making videos to tell them that

1073
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,870
they made a guide then they passed a

1074
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:32,120
part of the class synchronously and

1075
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,740
then there was some element that they

1076
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:36,080
delivered asynchronously and they had

1077
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,280
to deliver a guide with googlephone

1078
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,960
for example and things like that

1079
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,840
then a methodological modification was generated

1080
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,120
and that is the process and  It is the

1081
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,370
challenge that we are putting the most

1082
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:48,650
effort today because it is the great way to

1083
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:51,440
transform the version today about the

1084
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,330
same thing I am a professor at a university

1085
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:55,340
we are going platforms that are

1086
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,080
beginning to be designed that already existed

1087
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,400
but that were implemented with

1088
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,620
greater capacities during this  period

1089
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,090
I'm talking about blackboard for example

1090
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:03,560
I'm talking about canvas I'm talking

1091
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,960
about  this type of education platform

1092
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:09,560
and in particular there is a whole language

1093
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,470
within the process that within the

1094
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:14,810
university, for example, the

1095
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:17,210
students themselves try to tie for it

1096
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:18,830
and this has to do with the

1097
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:21,260
business of education because of the cost that

1098
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:24,740
I am paying I want to have hours it is

1099
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,990
difficult to try to reduce it to 45 minutes

1100
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:30,560
when, so to speak, the

1101
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,740
consumer demands more time

1102
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:36,740
to be present than to be present there

1103
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,869
although many times it will sound saturated

1104
00:43:38,869 --> 00:43:39,980
because many times

1105
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:42,260
the physical works have to be completed  it was three or

1106
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,820
four continuous hours you speak

1107
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:46,130
resident 45 hours as necessary to be

1108
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:48,170
able to have the attention of a young person how to

1109
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:50,510
try to level this understanding

1110
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:52,820
of the education business versus what

1111
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,980
it paid as

1112
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:57,830
quality education time in virtual version especially

1113
00:43:57,830 --> 00:43:59,089
if we consider  that many of these classes are

1114
00:43:59,089 --> 00:44:00,680
not going to be synchronous but it is not

1115
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,020
recorded to do they will be like

1116
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,400
this for the later  They will be able to be

1117
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,200
programmed depending on the time of life

1118
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,680
of each one

1119
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:12,010
and to have starting the first thing to

1120
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:14,740
understand education not as a business

1121
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:17,740
on the basis of all that was important the

1122
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:19,840
first thing is to understand that

1123
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,850
education is a right and is a

1124
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:25,570
permanent process  of societies, when

1125
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:28,240
we understand this, we understand that the way

1126
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,000
of learning can be diverse and one of

1127
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,410
the things that the

1128
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:34,330
pandemic is putting today is that it can be as diverse

1129
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:36,670
as the sources of learning that

1130
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:38,500
we have or as the

1131
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,570
learning tools that we have if due to

1132
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:42,160
circumstances  We have not

1133
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,410
had to place in this

1134
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:46,540
virtual learning formula what we have to

1135
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:48,880
do is adapt this learning process with

1136
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,830
respect to the

1137
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:53,320
possibilities that we have to develop

1138
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,420
the learning process and in that sense

1139
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:59,050
digital platforms open the

1140
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:02,170
possibility that we have some

1141
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:04,690
tools to  synchronous work and

1142
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:06,490
some other tools for

1143
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:08,880
synchronous work in the

1144
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,619
synchronous work you do not necessarily have

1145
00:45:11,619 --> 00:45:14,230
only zoom and myth you can do

1146
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:15,720
synchronous work through

1147
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,970
you can do synchronous work through

1148
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:20,149


1149
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,900
lied you can do synchronous work

1150
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,670
through boxes that are other

1151
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:27,560
platforms not necessarily

1152
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,750
have people live and direct that  This is

1153
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:31,010
what we try to convey

1154
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:34,070
this recommendation of the 45

1155
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:34,760
minutes

1156
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,160
is to be exposed in

1157
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,590
physical terms before a screen that is a

1158
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:41,150
limit that we have observed that it is

1159
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:44,090
appropriate that it is now all the rest of

1160
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:46,850
the educational process can occur on other

1161
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:49,010
platforms can  happen as I said

1162
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:50,840
going to generate

1163
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,820
significant experiences in the analogous world that

1164
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:54,410
the boy or girl has to do an

1165
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:56,630
experiment at home has to plant

1166
00:45:56,630 --> 00:46:00,680
a bean in a cotton so that it grows

1167
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,240
and can observe it and generate all the

1168
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,540
analysis of the gene  germination and

1169
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:08,510
from the biological point of view all

1170
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:11,090
these experiences are part of the

1171
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:13,630
learning process.  e that all these previously

1172
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:16,550
occurred in the educational establishment,

1173
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:18,140
what we are

1174
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:20,030
trying to present today is that there is a

1175
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:22,490
modification of the

1176
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:24,950
learning territory and what we propose is that

1177
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:26,030
this territory learns

1178
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:28,370
here is broader, today it is virtual but it

1179
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:30,410
is also analogous here in my  house is

1180
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:31,880
there this is what we have to begin to

1181
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,430
understand the learning space today

1182
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:36,650
is broader and for that we have to

1183
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:39,440
deliver new sources of learning and

1184
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,390
new learning tools to

1185
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:43,460
make it compatible with this way of

1186
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:45,380
learning that we are sorry when

1187
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,820
we say  new sources of you

1188
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:49,040
possibly refer to games own projects

1189
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,140
of development of leisure time

1190
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:53,390
we are talking the schemes

1191
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:54,620
considered for people who have the

1192
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:56,240
artistic world community like me

1193
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,300
world 12 or something wonderful of a treasure

1194
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,740
then try to talk about the time

1195
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,930
of a child  get bored something that seems

1196
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:04,460
prohibitive dangerous internet

1197
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:07,430
nowadays you mean that  In that of putting a

1198
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:08,930
vector of education that has to do

1199
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:11,270
with time to play, developing something of your

1200
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:12,770
own,

1201
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:16,070
of course, the greatest engine of

1202
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:18,140
learning is experimentation and

1203
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:20,620
experimentation is based on

1204
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:22,460
game methodologies. You are

1205
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,410
permanently playing to learn

1206
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:26,900
while you are experimenting when

1207
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,090
you have  What to do when you follow a

1208
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:30,380
tutorial, for example, what you are

1209
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,810
looking for is precisely to replicate something

1210
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:34,940
from the experimentation

1211
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:37,460
and experience and that is basically what

1212
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:39,470
today mobilizes the learning process,

1213
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:40,550
therefore if

1214
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:43,850
we can effectively promote that

1215
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:45,650
there is a disconnection of the  screens

1216
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:48,440
from the pedagogical point of view and that

1217
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,450
the learning process occurs to the

1218
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,670
extent that the experimentation processes are motivated

1219
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:55,310
in these times that

1220
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:56,510
today boys and girls are having

1221
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:58,880
their case and it is then the experience

1222
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,440
of basically the complementary of  what

1223
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:03,610
I was referring to as to go drawing as if

1224
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:06,170
perfect I have millions  of questions

1225
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:07,820
but let's try to do what I have

1226
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:09,740
a little time but let's go to who or

1227
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:11,570
what does it say rolled should lead this

1228
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:12,890
technological transformation for

1229
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,110
teachers

1230
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:19,250
tremendous question to the same money

1231
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:22,270
in order

1232
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:24,760
the first thing is to understand that the

1233
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,710
digital transformation process is a process  of

1234
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:29,380
cultural transformation, therefore

1235
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:31,630
we have to understand it as a process

1236
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:33,490
that has to be covered by

1237
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:36,430
society as a whole, not only by the

1238
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:39,550
state, not only by the process, this

1239
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:41,850
means that there must be

1240
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:44,740
adequate communication of this transformation process,

1241
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:46,930
basically the  The state

1242
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:49,390
has to be able to realize what

1243
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:51,400
are the needs that

1244
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,740
educational communities are having today

1245
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,940
basically in

1246
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:57,190
technological infrastructure and

1247
00:48:57,190 --> 00:48:58,840
technological competences that allow them to

1248
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,210
adequately develop the

1249
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:03,100
teaching-learning processes but on the other

1250
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,680
hand it is fundamental

1251
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,920
and the motivation with which  teachers

1252
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,930
assume this process of transformation

1253
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:12,660
digital mation educational communities

1254
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:15,059
usually talk a lot about leadership

1255
00:49:15,059 --> 00:49:17,770
in recent times there are a lot of

1256
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:19,599
institutions that are doing

1257
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,059
leadership courses for management teams and

1258
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:24,670
how to change management and a lot

1259
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,410
of things that have to do with how those

1260
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:28,750
of the  The educational community appropriates

1261
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:30,609
the transformation processes but

1262
00:49:30,609 --> 00:49:32,109
basically what we are

1263
00:49:32,109 --> 00:49:33,849
observing today is that these motivations

1264
00:49:33,849 --> 00:49:36,400
have to arise from the individual

1265
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,980
to the collective, therefore if

1266
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:40,780
we have a director or a

1267
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:44,530
school director who realizes that she is 60

1268
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:47,200
years old  It is difficult for her to work

1269
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,359
on the computer if she is not the

1270
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:51,400
first to say 6 that no I have

1271
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,690
to go to train as happened to us for

1272
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:54,640
example and if a giant training to

1273
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,190
the teachers of the commune of Santiago

1274
00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:59,829
Centro and there was a teacher of  directors

1275
00:49:59,829 --> 00:50:01,510
who told us not even to use the

1276
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:03,880
computer but I realized that I had

1277
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,589
to do it because if not this

1278
00:50:05,589 --> 00:50:08,069
transfer process  training was then going to give us

1279
00:50:08,069 --> 00:50:09,640
understanding that there is a responsibility

1280
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,750
of the institutions the state

1281
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:14,950
understanding that there is a responsibility

1282
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:17,380
of the supporters because in Chile

1283
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:19,599
we have this figure of the supporter, this

1284
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:23,079
supporter has to realize the

1285
00:50:23,079 --> 00:50:25,359
need to generate

1286
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:26,530
appropriation processes and

1287
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:28,599
technological infrastructure that  They can contribute to

1288
00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:30,490
the educational process and this is also

1289
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:32,680
important because in

1290
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:33,940
the 90's there was

1291
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:36,579
a gigantic emergence of technology companies

1292
00:50:36,579 --> 00:50:38,109
for education,

1293
00:50:38,109 --> 00:50:39,970
all of which sold computers with the

1294
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:41,589
English laboratory and with the

1295
00:50:41,589 --> 00:50:43,270
electronic whiteboard and a lot of would like them to

1296
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:45,010
go  the schools and realizing that

1297
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:46,420
the electronic board were stored

1298
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:48,190
in a warehouse, the teachers never knew

1299
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:49,990
how to use it, therefore what did not

1300
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:53,849
happen was the process of

1301
00:50:53,849 --> 00:50:57,160
digital acculturation and here is the key,

1302
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:00,430
basically, to be able to get the

1303
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:05,140
teachers to be enthusiastic about this process

1304
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:08,170
and say 6 that I just realized that I

1305
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:09,100
worked  or less

1306
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:10,720
if I do the tests through google

1307
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,390
form because I have to replicate afterwards only

1308
00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:16,450
replicate the captain rubric, that

1309
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:18,820
is, and it is that I realized that I have the

1310
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:20,680
possibility of planning faster

1311
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,450
because I have the possibility of

1312
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:24,280
replicating the planning elements

1313
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,600
for  each of the

1314
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,210
classes and so on when they

1315
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,010
realize that technology can

1316
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:32,080
help us improve their quality of life in the

1317
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:33,670
process of digital transformation becomes

1318
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:35,950
concrete and finally there are

1319
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:38,410
students and students also

1320
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:40,360
have to be part of this

1321
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,700
digital transformation process  Even

1322
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,490
families today, mothers and fathers have

1323
00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:47,710
had to be mediators of the

1324
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:49,300
teaching-learning process, therefore they have

1325
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,100
had to learn to use the google

1326
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:54,070
drive to use the link the rooms to

1327
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:56,440
use tools such as mural canvas and

1328
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,060
all those that we  the teachers are asking

1329
00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:59,260
us to help our

1330
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:01,390
students our children to do

1331
00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:03,700
to be part of the classes

1332
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:06,850
then  Finally, all this is a

1333
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:08,770
transformation process that

1334
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:11,200
involves many actors, but in the

1335
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,840
main it has to do with understanding that

1336
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,820
digital transformation can

1337
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:18,610
improve the quality of life and the quality of

1338
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:21,420
education in our beauty,

1339
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:23,240
that response was really overwhelming.

1340
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,760
there are too many points

1341
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:29,119
really overwhelming answer seriously

1342
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:31,859
byron aránguis how can we reinforce the

1343
00:52:31,859 --> 00:52:33,750
manual technical contents through

1344
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:35,339
the classes ailments sometimes there are missing

1345
00:52:35,339 --> 00:52:37,799
implements the person the gap in the

1346
00:52:37,799 --> 00:52:40,400
distance the money

1347
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,890
look is a very good question and it is something

1348
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:44,750
that we have been having to go

1349
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:48,020
solving over time and there have been

1350
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:51,289
some and public institutions for

1351
00:52:51,289 --> 00:52:53,720
example that have generated certain such as

1352
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:57,250
tool cases with some

1353
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:59,450
elements that allow them to work

1354
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:03,559
at home from tempera blogs and anti-

1355
00:53:03,559 --> 00:53:05,750
tools that can work

1356
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,940
from crafts because indeed one

1357
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:10,039
of the things that  we can not do is that

1358
00:53:10,039 --> 00:53:13,539
the gap that already existed pr  caused by

1359
00:53:13,539 --> 00:53:15,890
the socioeconomic differences of the

1360
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:17,240
boys and girls who came to our

1361
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:20,029
classroom are beginning to amplify now that they

1362
00:53:20,029 --> 00:53:21,260
are having to be at home

1363
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:23,990
because if they came to the classroom

1364
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:26,089
at least in the classroom they had the

1365
00:53:26,089 --> 00:53:27,589
possibility of having the same

1366
00:53:27,589 --> 00:53:29,240
materials all and that is  The school

1367
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,430
had the possibilities of giving

1368
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:33,680
those materials to everyone, what happens

1369
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,359
now in our homes is that we

1370
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,430
cannot demand that the children have

1371
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:40,670
all a 3-liter bottle of

1372
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:43,549
acceptable and a copper cable because

1373
00:53:43,549 --> 00:53:45,500
perhaps they do not have the possibility of

1374
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,180
acquiring for  Therefore, what

1375
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:50,089
is today is that experiences

1376
00:53:50,089 --> 00:53:51,980
especially in subjects such as technology or

1377
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:53,869
manual technician that today is called

1378
00:53:53,869 --> 00:53:55,250
technology but is the old

1379
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:57,920
manual technician or the more manual or

1380
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,700
artistic activities can occur in understanding

1381
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:04,069
the context of our student by

1382
00:54:04,069 --> 00:54:06,680
example generate activities

1383
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:09,680
that can use things that are if

1384
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,589
in your house located in your house that can be

1385
00:54:12,589 --> 00:54:14,750
useful  raise kitchen tools that

1386
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:17,710
may be able to use some type of

1387
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:20,750
tools that are inside the bathroom or

1388
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:22,819
things like that but that are

1389
00:54:22,819 --> 00:54:25,160
within the context of the possibilities

1390
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,530
of the students and then another of the

1391
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:28,940
elements that we have promoted

1392
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:31,339
act is that effectively the

1393
00:54:31,339 --> 00:54:33,290
communities  educational programs now make a

1394
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:35,750
registry of the requirements that

1395
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:38,210
both teachers and

1396
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:40,190
homes are having to be able to generate a kind

1397
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:43,849
of suitcase or briefcase of us we

1398
00:54:43,849 --> 00:54:47,960
call it in the survival suitcase it

1399
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,540
sends some elements to the houses of the boys and girls

1400
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:52,580
that allow them

1401
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,500
continue with these learning processes

1402
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,200
but at home without increasing this

1403
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,170
gap that we have previously here

1404
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:02,359
evidently we have had in this

1405
00:55:02,359 --> 00:55:05,560
google in recent years

1406
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:10,140
alondra peñalillo and it is with this that I am going to

1407
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,670
stay with the last question: how is it

1408
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:13,020
possible to reconcile digital well-being

1409
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:14,850
with  explosion of content and

1410
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:17,310
classes on the internet is there any advice

1411
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:19,770
to  make digital breaks what a good

1412
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:22,920
concept is the following we

1413
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,440
talk a lot about the concept of well-being

1414
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,380
digitally basically because we have

1415
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:31,200
defined that in order to coexist

1416
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,520
adequately in the digital space

1417
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,610
you have to set limits for yourself, that is, not everything

1418
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:37,050
can be solved in the digital space

1419
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:41,000
the first thing to understand is what

1420
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,790
already  Before the pandemic it was important

1421
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:47,090
that in homes there are

1422
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:51,500
consumption limits that is key because because the

1423
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,060
limits of the louis vain that the gringos tell them

1424
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:55,100
are what allow to generate

1425
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:57,050
stability is in the

1426
00:55:57,050 --> 00:55:58,520
psychosocial development processes of

1427
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:00,040
children and young people

1428
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:02,350
and that  The child of that have to be

1429
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:04,830
agreed because they have to be

1430
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:08,260
validated by the children and children

1431
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:10,330
so in my case I am going to give you an

1432
00:56:10,330 --> 00:56:13,090
example I have a little girl and we have

1433
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:15,490
what I made her some pieces of paper

1434
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:18,700
called internet consumer vouchers

1435
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:21,340
then  she has the possibility of

1436
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:24,400
consuming half an hour a day and has

1437
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,300
5 10 and 15 minute slips and

1438
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:29,890
she  She can use when she wants then she

1439
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:33,250
tells me dad I want to watch TV now 10

1440
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:35,590
perfect minutes 10 minutes she's

1441
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:37,720
running the 10-minute timer

1442
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,000
it's over she's already taken her first piece of paper she

1443
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,350
has three pieces of paper in the day and it's

1444
00:56:41,350 --> 00:56:45,060
over and she knows she's being

1445
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:48,850
mediated  your time with certain limits and

1446
00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:51,340
that is an agreement that we both reach,

1447
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:53,830
that type of agreement can be given at

1448
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:58,210
home and also at school and at another

1449
00:56:58,210 --> 00:57:00,520
point that has to do with the

1450
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,650
compatibility of the actions we

1451
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:04,110
do in the digital space

1452
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:06,820
effectively  With the emergence of the

1453
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:07,150
band,

1454
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:08,680
what we had to do is be more

1455
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,840
connected as a result of functional actions such

1456
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,580
as learning and

1457
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:15,630
work taking place in the virtual space.

1458
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:18,520


1459
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,950


1460
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:22,780
Ten

1461
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:24,610
o'clock at night teacher what is tomorrow's homework,

1462
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:26,140
hey, you know you won't be able to

1463
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:28,570
send you the homework because we

1464
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:31,360
forgot there was a lot and so on.  You

1465
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,750
have a whatsapp group with your parents

1466
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:36,280
at ten o'clock at night working because of the

1467
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,860
limits to the whatsapp schedule,

1468
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:40,060
I know that today many teachers have

1469
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:42,940
had to take the step to open these

1470
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:44,080
whatsapp groups because it is a

1471
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,000
necessity on the part of the  of those of the

1472
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,010
fathers and mothers mainly but he

1473
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:50,110
cannot be having a conversation

1474
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:52,450
at 11 12 on Sunday night to

1475
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:53,800
find out what he is going to have to

1476
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,690
do on Monday with your student because

1477
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:59,710
then limits and limits are with

1478
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:02,380
those with the students with the

1479
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:05,170
parents and also with your

1480
00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:08,290
work teams and here something key cannot be

1481
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:10,330
that the director or the director or the

1482
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:12,400
inspector or the boss is also sending you a

1483
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,960
message at 9

1484
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:17,619
o'clock at night and tomorrow coordination meeting no  There are

1485
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:19,990
formal channels and it is important to

1486
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:22,359
define what those formal channels are.

1487
00:58:22,359 --> 00:58:24,550
Basically order the monkey that you are,

1488
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:26,859
order how we are going to work in the

1489
00:58:26,859 --> 00:58:29,830
digital space and that which

1490
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:32,859
we previously had to mark and tar  I did not know and

1491
00:58:32,859 --> 00:58:35,230
that I had to put the fingerprint or I

1492
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:37,240
knew that I had and the breaks and your

1493
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,460
lunchtime schedule today that also

1494
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:41,530
has to be agreed in the

1495
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:44,260
virtual space and that is a way to have the

1496
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:45,609
digital well-being that we are

1497
00:58:45,609 --> 00:58:47,740
promoting and  I feel that the

1498
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:49,300
Anglo culture is more perfect in that it knows how to

1499
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:51,010
respect and they have had enough struggles

1500
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:52,150
also much more precise than those that

1501
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:53,800
we have been able to achieve to be

1502
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,450
able to establish that truly

1503
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:57,940
family time or time outside work is

1504
00:58:57,940 --> 00:58:59,470
important something that goes  to persecute

1505
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:00,849
teachers for a long time because

1506
00:59:00,849 --> 00:59:02,800
as I was telling you or they think that it is business they

1507
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,270
think that the law also makes it

1508
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:08,290
demand that way it is a bit

1509
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:09,760
of the teacher's perception that there is

1510
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,380
socially precisely with the issue of

1511
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:13,810
education it is complex that point stop

1512
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:15,310
let him be released from not writing to him I

1513
00:59:15,310 --> 00:59:17,140
have whatsapp from my son's course I see

1514
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:19,599
how they jump jump weekend jump

1515
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:20,620
at

1516
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:22,360
night parents manage to have  time to be

1517
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:23,710
able to dedicate things of course

1518
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:25,120
after work when the children sleep

1519
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,500
then the passage begins to work

1520
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:29,830
well, it is quite a lot the technology has

1521
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:31,150
vectors that come to you from different

1522
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:32,290
places when they have to pressure you

1523
00:59:32,290 --> 00:59:34,400
on the issue of education it

1524
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,859
is very important to understand that the

1525
00:59:36,859 --> 00:59:39,740
teacher  A learning mediator but

1526
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:42,890
is not a seller of learning

1527
00:59:42,890 --> 00:59:44,210
cannot be serving you as if he were a

1528
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:46,400
seller from here and that is why understanding

1529
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,559
that education is not a business

1530
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:51,020
education is a right that has to

1531
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:51,980
do with a lifelong learning process

1532
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:54,349
of  Communities

1533
00:59:54,349 --> 00:59:56,630
therefore have to understand

1534
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:59,270
that the role of the teacher reaches the

1535
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:00,890
level that corresponds to him that up to

1536
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:02,210
the space that corresponds to him or to the

1537
01:00:02,210 --> 01:00:03,799
time that corresponds to him, which is

1538
01:00:03,799 --> 01:00:05,510
basically to be a mediator of the

1539
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:07,460
teaching-learning process  Interestingly, the

1540
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:08,990
term mediators in psychology is

1541
01:00:08,990 --> 01:00:10,549
defined thus to people who have to

1542
01:00:10,549 --> 01:00:12,529
deal with children what  Eu is the mediator

1543
01:00:12,529 --> 01:00:14,210
of the children's experience to

1544
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:15,619
precisely try to avoid

1545
01:00:15,619 --> 01:00:17,089
adult issues thanks to which is something that

1546
01:00:17,089 --> 01:00:18,529
is also beginning to become clear as a

1547
01:00:18,529 --> 01:00:22,130
concept in these new societies

1548
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:23,329
that we are having just because

1549
01:00:23,329 --> 01:00:24,770
precisely because I put

1550
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:26,480
information exchange behind the paulo networks

1551
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,579
I could be talking to you I have

1552
01:00:28,579 --> 01:00:30,140
a million personal doubts

1553
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:31,520
about the education that you like I would

1554
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,770
