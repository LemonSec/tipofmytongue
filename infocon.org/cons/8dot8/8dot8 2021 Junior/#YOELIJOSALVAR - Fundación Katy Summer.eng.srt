with strict schedules but

11
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,120

that we have been committed for six years

31
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,020
to educate young people

32
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,330
and citizens in general in cybersecurity and that is

33
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,460
the reason why this year we also

34
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,770
established a spear  an alliance with the

35
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,900

36
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,300

and we come to share our talk with you.

75
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:15,319
I choose to save the talk with  the one in which

76
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:17,239
we initiate the actions of the foundation and

77
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,420
in which we share the process in

78
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,659
which we did and have done what

79
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:24,920
we have done on behalf of  e our

80
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,569
daughter is a whole journey, it is a whole

81
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:28,580
journey, boys, we lived through a

82
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,160
very strong situation and when we lost our daughter, we

83
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,290
had to survive, we had to make the

84
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,569
option to continue living, to continue

85
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:38,000
having our family together, we had

86
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,550
a small son in that minute of

87
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:45,060
three years.  and a half we do not want as a

88
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,010
marriage we wanted to continue together were

89
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,500
many things that led us to judge ourselves

90
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,810
for doing something else and not

91
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,960
crying

92
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,030
so in that sense before leaving

93
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,940
we want to share with you

94
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,100

116
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,319
five years he told us I already decided I

117

staying with Mongua we are going to have a

119
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,479
singer who is rich and then quickly

120
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,550
no it was not like it happened a long time he

121
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,009
says hey but you are not

122
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,009
supporting anything so that I can be  singer and

123
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:48,169
we told him but what we have

124
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:50,270
to do, you have to support a

125
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,940
lot so that I become a singer and you have

126
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,580
to find a way to do it and so we

127
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,340
looked at each other and said well, something has to be

128

was but  of course what  Do and how much did

169
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:55,560
Katy and Alicia look at each other and say to him, "Oh,

170
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,320
no song was known and I hope as

171
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,060
no song was known if he sings

172
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,520
all day at home well, as no song was known,

173
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,620
we sang with my guitar

174
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,100
the chicks say why to them  I

175
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,870
tell you this because sometimes with the

176
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,030
most insignificant things that you

177
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,870
say, this is nothing to do with those,

178
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:19,940
you can begin to fulfill your dreams

179
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:22,949
and what happened to us happened that seeing that

180
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:24,569
our daughter wanted to sing that she wanted to

181
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:26,849
hit the stage and enjoy  And

182
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:28,860
as you saw in the video to go on

183
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,960
stage in a super comfortable space, she

184
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,899
danced, she sang, she spoke, she did whatever she

185
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,419
wanted and she felt good and we

186
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,219
prepared her for that for a real stage,

187
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:40,799
prepared her to be on a

188
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,208
stage where she could see people

189
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:44,519
and  where for the time being I could see that

190
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:47,040
some group the spoon chose we do not

191
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,510
like your song we do not like how

192
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,620
you dance even if they want ugly and sing badly

193
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,790
but we prepare it for that

194
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,740
we prepare it  For a physical scenario

195
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,529
in which the interactions were physical,

196
00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:00,420
in our youth we did not have

197
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,250
access to the level of technology that

198
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,529
many of you have and that she had

199
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:07,019
and we were not aware of how

200
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:08,760
we also had to work in that

201
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,769
digital space but also take care of it  and

202
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:12,829
prepare it in a different way,

203
00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:15,839
unfortunately katy one weekend

204
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,260
May 18 May 21, 2018 fair

205
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,630
was a birthday party like

206
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,010
anybody you can go to a

207
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,050
full party and this birthday party

208
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,290


209
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:29,380
with a boy apparently the boy had

210
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,110
a  couple and that was the reason that in the

211
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,240
confession group of her school they

212
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,190
began to attack her during that

213
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:39,310
weekend that unfortunately women

214
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,529
who kiss with a boy are

215
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:44,319
treated with everything that you can think of

216
00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:46,600
in  change to the boys they are

217
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,750
treated many times as champion of

218
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,529
power idol and unfortunately the aggression

219
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:55,329
that biocati was a gender aggression

220
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:58,259
in which the ag  They redid and denigrated her

221
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:01,130
for being a woman,

222
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,440
what happened to us happened to us that because of a

223
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,360
better strategy than we as

224
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,160
moms we thought we were having

225
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,170
with her, no matter how much or not we are the

226
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,790
strategy that our parents suddenly

227
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,580
used with us, we realized  that

228
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,500
this strategy did not work for us without a

229
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,650
context and a culture of collaboration

230
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,400
in that group

231
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,680
of confessions there were more than 150

232
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,110
companions of hers that we

233
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:27,170
knew many we knew a lot

234
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,060
we had received it even in our

235
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,820
home many knew how to contact us

236
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,770
but none occurred to him  to do it

237
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,230
none took the phone none told us they

238
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,700
are attacking the cat and

239
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,510
this is happening nothing

240
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,040
and we started to do after we

241
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,390
lost katy that she give us a

242
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,760
letter where she tells us that the

243
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,160
reasons why somehow triggered

244
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,810
this final decision  because we have to

245
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,190
understand and later we are going to

246
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,200
talk about it, suicide is not

247
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,360
the person's decision to finish co  n her life is

248
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,830
the decision of a person to

249
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,870
end the pain she is experiencing for her

250
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,540
it became terrifying to go to her school

251
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,180
it became a space in which she did

252
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,610
not feel safe in her letter she said I am

253
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,580
terrified of going to school and it was that  From

254
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,560
there we began to work with different

255
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,780
entities, including digital native and

256
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,700
pablo christine in trying to understand

257
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,940
what it was that we as

258
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,950
Katy's parents did not see, what we did not

259
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:23,320
teach her and that was why, together with

260
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,880
the ministry of education in that  In the same

261
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,310
year 2018 we launched a campaign

262
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:30,270
called there are words that kill

263
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,640
and this campaign is focused on using

264
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,290
artificial intelligence using a

265
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,760
bot that you are for you is

266
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,010
easier to understand in which with this

267
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,570
vote we were able to read more than 10,000

268
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,450
comments within a period of  45 days on

269
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,980
twitter, instagram

270
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,930
and facebook to try to identify

271
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,460
young people who were using

272
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,080
words that were aggressive that were

273
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,300
denigrating along with this campaign po  We can

274
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,270
identify that 4000 messages of the

275
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,220
10,000 who had read the post had

276
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,720
any of these comments,

277
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,150
therefore 40 percent of the young people in the

278
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,730
interactions in digital media

279
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:04,470
contain aggressive content and

280
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,000
we pretended that they were the young people

281
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,250
because of course the young people had

282
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,900
destroyed our daughter who else was going to

283
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,210
do we realized that 96

284
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,130
percent of these aggressions occurred on

285
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,990
twitter and twitter are generally

286
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:19,320
also adults but still the message

287
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,330
that we need all of us to understand is

288
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:23,400
before posting ways that

289
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,050
I am suddenly seeing  a black device a

290
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,700
black screen and I do not see the other

291
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,800
person in front and the process

292
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,290
of natural empathy is more difficult I have

293
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,180
to understand that before I post I have

294
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,640
to think it is good vibes what I am going to

295
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,420
say

296
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,670
I am going to comment on what is going on  to mention what

297
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:42,480
I am going to post it is true it makes sense it

298
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,139
is really useful and it is necessary I have

299
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:48,360
to do it or I do not have to do it I do not

300
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,589
I am doing it simply because I am

301
00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:52,110
bored or bored or because someone

302
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,000
told me about it and I do not know if it is true I do not know if it

303
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,209
is happening now but someone said

304
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,829
many young people told us many times they

305
00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:00,540
fall into cyberbullying situations and

306
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,639
start attacking colleagues because they

307
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,320
were bored in the  weekends and

308
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,209
when the long weekend they get

309
00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:08,070
more bored then as they are bored they

310
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,290
start to make memes attack

311
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:14,070
to annoy and insult other people in

312
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,750
their community and the craziest thing is that the

313
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,399
long weekends that

314
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,230
we could generally enjoy more and do  more

315
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:22,499
things are the most dangerous

316
00:13:22,499 --> 00:13:24,749
how many of you enjoy

317
00:13:24,749 --> 00:13:26,579
music when you have had the

318
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:29,039
opportunity to go to concerts of your

319
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:32,729
favorite singers sing in a way

320
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,499
because you loved music when

321
00:13:34,499 --> 00:13:36,479
we miss going to a concert of

322
00:13:36,479 --> 00:13:38,159
how many we miss going  At a

323
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,800
concert,

324
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,870
Katy loved music and it wasn't

325
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,610
that they liked it a little bit but that she

326
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,620
loved it, it was her passion until  Last

327
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,910
day he composed three songs

328
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,190
and had a super one and he

329
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:51,930
loved it and he loved it because it had

330
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:54,630
songs with content because it was cute

331
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,450
because scare they were incredible guess

332
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,160
who it is I do not know if there will be any of them but some of them

333
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,980
follow it but taylor

334
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,680
swift a thousand reasons  To love her a thousand

335
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,420
reasons to love it, it was about

336
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,980
us stopping them too so that

337
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,780
all the dads see that good we have to

338
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,690
follow our children's

339
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:15,420
and what happened gave you to all the

340
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,400
conditions that sometimes magically

341
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,230
occur for  get to a

342
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,320
TV concert a year in advance we were able to

343
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,840
buy the ticket at the best price

344
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,190
then we could go we had the

345
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,690
chance to be in the place and we

346
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,760
weren't going to miss that great port.

347
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,500


348
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,020
Actually

349
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,050
but what happens does she say if I am going to live

350
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,460
the opportunity she has to do in the

351
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,400
best way and how we have to go with

352
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,000
a perfect costume and that it is better than

353
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,640
a unicorn  or better than a horse, a

354
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,760
unicorn and better than a unicorn, a

355
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,630
paste with a paste corn and a paste with

356
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,840
good there she has, she looked for a costume

357
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,880
and I prepared it because she also

358
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,000
designs a costume for a corn paste

359
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,300
but going alone was not  the bony option

360
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,070
obviously was going to go with someone

361
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:10,700
the chosen one was emanuel dad

362
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,830
katy wanted to go disguised because he knew

363
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,960
that taylor swift invited people

364
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,730
who called his attention to a

365
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,680
private meeting after the concert and she

366
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,140
wanted yes or yes to be there but she said to

367
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,760
increase the probability that I stay

368
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,680
I have to make sure not only that I

369
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,360
go in disguise but whoever goes

370
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,370
also has to address so she

371
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,740
convinced me to also wear a

372
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,830
sequin costume with led lights,

373
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:37,550
wings and rope, everything to be able to be with

374
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:40,630
her and achieve  what taylor swift gave us

375
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,250
now that I tell you all the backstage

376
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,170
of that suit

377
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,600
obviously parents never have time

378
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,339
and less will they have time for a

379
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:51,620
costume fitting and this  Dad didn't

380
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,420
have time for the wardrobe test either

381
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,089
and since he had to play it in the street

382
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:58,670
he played it because everything turned out perfect he

383
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,170
could not attend the wardrobe test

384
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:03,560
well what a shame he got the day he

385
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,410
tried on his suit that was too small for him

386
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,449
uncomfortable, the closure did not let him go to the bathroom

387
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:11,180
for about eight hours but hey,

388
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,880
parents sometimes don't understand and he says this because he

389
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,980
wanted to show katyn at that age

390
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,110
girl that he could already trust me for whatever

391
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,389
it was that he could already talk to me.

392
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:22,040
Let her go and we are going to talk to her, we are

393
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,930
going to understand her and be there for her

394
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,699
because what I enjoyed the most was

395
00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:27,529
being in those moments both happy

396
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:30,529
and difficult and accompanying her in that

397
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:32,120
sense and I am sure that many of

398
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,060
you teachers, parents or young people,

399
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,709
suddenly  they feel identified and say

400
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:38,180
I have also done good things for my

401
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,320
family for the people around me

402
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,380
for my students unfortunately many of

403
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,570
these things sometimes add up but not

404
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,660
enough since  Today we have three

405
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,240
suicides per week of young people

406
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,300
in Chile and we do not realize how

407
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,519
behind each one of them in between 80

408
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,860
and 100 that they are trying or have not

409
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,350
thought about it and we are not aware of

410
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,720
how cyberbullying increases in  suicidal ideation more than 11

411
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,089
times in whoever is a

412
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:07,579
victim of it and to understand it

413
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:09,709
sometimes we have to realize that this

414
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:12,349
is not a matter of mood it is a

415
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:14,959
disease depression is a

416
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,699
disease and here we are looking at some

417
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:18,679
CT scans in which we see  a brain

418
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:19,280
on the left

419
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,690
that does not show that it is experiencing

420
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,550
depression in the right brain that is not

421
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,500
experiencing it and we

422
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,050
immediately notice the differences we see that

423
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,970
literally the brain on the left

424
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,370
is off that does not have

425
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:33,650
neural capacity to solve problems see its

426
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,540
that the brain and  the right if it is

427
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,020
on and it is luminous therefore

428
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,180
if it can solve issues that it can

429
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,850
see but unfortunately and so much stigma

430
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,500
and so many myths with e  mental illnesses

431
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,450
that we believe that depression is

432
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,790
simply a state of mind, if

433
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,680
you can, lift your spirits because it is

434
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,840
always so negative because everything has

435
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,700
to be bad with you if there is someone who would

436
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,380
bore me being with you because everything looks

437
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,220
bad you want to encourage

438
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,130
and depression is not  a disease

439
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,900
like cancer is a disease

440
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,700
depression is also and it is not that a

441
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,190
person wishes to have depression or

442
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:11,590
fell into a depression not a

443
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,350
person got depression just like a person

444
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:17,020
got cancer and we have to understand that in

445
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,820
In that sense, what we have to do the most

446
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,679
is to help this person because,

447
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:22,480
unlike cancer that attacked a

448
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,960
specific organ, depression by attacking

449
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,530
the brain makes you think, your own

450
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:32,230
brain begins to tell you that the only

451
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,840
way to end that disease is by

452
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,120
ending it.  with your life and that is

453
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,980
what makes it more risky a person with

454
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,480
cancer can suddenly start doing

455
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,460
treatments and work to fight

456
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,740
against their disease  ad thinks there are several

457
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,390
alternatives there is a chemo there is a

458
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,100
doctor I can do this I can do it to

459
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,740
another his brain works but a

460
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,270
person with depression his brain does not

461
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,789
work as it should and

462
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:56,200
therefore what we have to do when

463
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,640
we are seeing an image like this  is

464
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,400
to realize first that I have no

465
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,070
idea the sexual orientation

466
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:06,250
where the commune lives, how they dress, how they

467
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,620
speak what language they speak, I have no

468
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,820
idea of the person on the

469
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,590
left and I also have no idea of the

470
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,360
person on the right.  two

471
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,389
human beings just like you or me or

472
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:19,149
who reads to him and our mission if our

473
00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:21,039
brain is on and we are not

474
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,659
going through a depression we are not

475
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:25,000
going through a difficulty in being able to be

476
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,860
available to help the person

477
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,200
next to that person  whose brain

478
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,509
is not working when we

479
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:32,889
began to work with the different

480
00:19:32,889 --> 00:19:34,870
foundations that we began to get together and

481
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,389
be together we began to realize

482
00:19:37,389 --> 00:19:40,330
that after a month of hab  er lost katy

483
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,059
we had already lost six more young people

484
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:43,779
only here in the metropolitan region

485
00:19:43,779 --> 00:19:46,179
and unfortunately none of them

486
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:48,220
appeared in any media no one spoke

487
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,980
of this girl nothing spoke of a boy and they

488
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,990
were cases equal to or worse than

489
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:55,299
katyn's there we felt

490
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:57,759
responsible for doing something because we

491
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:59,320
find this phrase by

492
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,809
Albert Einsten that says the world is a

493
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:04,210
dangerous place but not because of what they do

494
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,460
wrong but because of those who look and

495
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,529
do nothing with it and we looked at each other and

496
00:20:08,529 --> 00:20:09,610
said now we are

497
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,799
actually fine that  Before we had not seen

498
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:14,380
that it hit us coldly in the face and that

499
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,090
it destroyed our hearts for a long

500
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,610
time and today today we still cry

501
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,799
for our katy but our

502
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,270
responsibility for having been so

503
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,370
mediatic for having been so much

504
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:27,580
space was to stop and make sure to

505
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,980
stop  doing nothing and starting to do

506
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,950
something doing nothing was not an option for

507
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:36,640
us and I can tell you that the

508
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,179
friends disappeared the super  best

509
00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:42,549
friends all disappeared the dads

510
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:44,620
moms who were friends of ours also

511
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,410
disappeared never again we

512
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:51,250
saw them again the same day at Katy's farewell and

513
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,470
funeral we told them the boys

514
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,049
so that they would feel liberated not because

515
00:20:56,049 --> 00:20:57,490
we have the power of absolution

516
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,590
but simply  We

517
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,530
looked at them in the face and we said

518
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:04,600
we forgive them because the pain

519
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,340
is so great and we cannot carry

520
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,100
you so if you want to go see us,

521
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,960
go, you know our house, if you

522
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,179
want to call, call us, contact

523
00:21:13,179 --> 00:21:15,250
us, let's talk to each other, we don't want you to feel

524
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,269
bad.  We are going to believe

525
00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:18,459
and understand that I had no idea what they

526
00:21:18,459 --> 00:21:20,739
did until today, no one

527
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:23,019
contacted us and that is why today

528
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:26,080
we want to tell you if you are seeing

529
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,299
any aggression if you are seeing that

530
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:29,559
someone is wrong who is reacting

531
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:32,619
strangely.  some reason clearly his

532
00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:35,109
brain is not working is super

533
00:21:35,109 --> 00:21:36,849
hector poured is super fun but

534
00:21:36,849 --> 00:21:40,839
now he does nothing he loves to dance  a is very

535
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:43,019
active but now out of nowhere something went off

536
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:46,450
something is happening if you don't know what

537
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,519
is happening or sometimes if you know what

538
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:50,019
is happening you are seeing that they are

539
00:21:50,019 --> 00:21:51,159
attacking him through social networks

540
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:53,649
something lethal they hacked the account what do

541
00:21:53,649 --> 00:21:57,339
I know something  It happened and if something happened what are you going to

542
00:21:57,339 --> 00:22:00,999
do you are already a witness if you know you are a

543
00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:02,979
witness you did not choose it but you are a witness

544
00:22:02,979 --> 00:22:05,709
and if you are a witness what kind of witness are

545
00:22:05,709 --> 00:22:09,249
you going to become an accomplice?

546
00:22:09,249 --> 00:22:12,339


547
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:15,129
It generates that not only

548
00:22:15,129 --> 00:22:16,749
annoys him a little more but that they

549
00:22:16,749 --> 00:22:19,779
destroy him or a Chilean term that makes

550
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:21,510
him poor

551
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:25,650
that you want that you are going to allow the other

552
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:29,250
option is to be a cover-up witness the

553
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,860
tt or cover-up says if you see that

554
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:35,640
he deserves it the same  It's bad vibes, I still do

555
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,100
n't like him, so many things

556
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,039
do you want to be a cover-up witness to do

557
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,380
nothing to remain silent to watch how they

558
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,240
destroy another is your best option,

559
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,880
how many people did we

560
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,260
need to react so that?

561
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,430
Today the street would have been with

562
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,290
us so that we could have

563
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:03,210
known that something was happening a

564
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:06,960
call would have alerted us a message

565
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,160
something none did not reach us if

566
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,050
we are from here today because we want

567
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:15,330
you to be that message that sometimes will be

568
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:19,340
the only one  but that you are, and for that we

569
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:22,740
need that if you are a witness, you are the

570
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:26,720
best witness, you are a saving witness, the

571
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,970
saving witness is the one who makes a

572
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:32,640
choice, he says, I am not going to destroy, I

573
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,380
am not going to,

574
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,830
I am not going to let this continue to happen.

575
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:39,300
choice and you know what the

576
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,930
choice is the saving witness chooses to

577
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,999
save

578
00:23:44,999 --> 00:23:47,759
and that is why I am going to ask you something

579
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,889
that you and know how to do and that is to approach

580
00:23:49,889 --> 00:23:54,509
the keyboard and put in that chat a

581
00:23:54,509 --> 00:23:57,809
little phrase that means that you

582
00:23:57,809 --> 00:24:00,119
heard this message that to

583
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:01,799
We mean that they not

584
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,179
only listen to it or they also

585
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:07,979
understood it and that message came to them. It is

586
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:10,289
the name of our book. It is the name

587
00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:12,299
of our talk. It is a decision we have made.

588
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:15,809
You are taken from life is a choice and it

589
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:20,800
says I choose to save

590
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,590
I choose to save

591
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,320
I want you to put it now in the chat

592
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,730
so that we understand that if you

593
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:30,279
heard this message I choose to save it

594
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:32,429
means I will not keep silent

595
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:35,200
I choose to save it means I will be

596
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,260
supportive I choose to save means I

597
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,049
will be present with the son save

598
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:44,830
means to do nothing is not my option it is not

599
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:48,659
my option to attack another it is not my option to

600
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:51,400
destroy a life it is not my option

601
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,039
I will be empathetic I choose to save

602
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:57,490
means I will be supportive I choose

603
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:00,309
Saving is a life option is the

604
00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:02,140
option that we make know

605
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,840
why perhaps first to save

606
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,620
us

607
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,630
and you know how we have saved

608
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:11,670
ourselves by helping others

609
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:15,900
if you are going to choose choose to save and if you are going to

610
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,270
put a message now with that message

611
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:21,750
I choose to save so that it enters you not

612
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,960
only through the audio and

613
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,880
through the image but also

614
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,720
incorporates it through your hands but that

615
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,320
your hands can also say me  I choose to

616
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,770


617
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:38,530
save that we came to look for

618
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:41,380
saving witnesses because in this

619
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,440
hacker conference that sounds like too much power and

620
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,500
that is too power we want you to be

621
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,570
the most power and you know who is

622
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:52,450
the most power the most power is the one who

623
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,630
saves the map with the  who does a

624
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:58,990
solidarity action the rest the one who looks like

625
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,040
someone else is destroyed

626
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,160
is not the most power the one who does nothing

627
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,770
is not the most power if you want to take all

628
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:09,410
the energy take the energy to be a

629
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:12,860
saving witness and to be the change

00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,570
thank you for listening to us

662
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:32,290
and a lot of power for all,

663
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:34,570
many thanks to Gabriel 8.8 Júnior for

664
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:37,510
this invitation and happy to be one

665
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:39,130
more time if any questions or

666
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,930
doubts something that we can  talk they

667
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:42,760
passed there will be doreste they passed

668
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,330
thank you very much that heavy the talk the truth is

669
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:50,290
that I do not know congratulations  or they went over there, I

670
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:51,640
was very excited with everything they

671
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,270
told, there are many questions I am going to

672
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:58,990
ask them the first one, how can we

673
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:01,390
find out if our children are victims

674
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,610
of cyberbulling since there are

675
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:06,130
hidden privileges or groups that we do not have how to

676
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:08,860
know as parents without having some  Notice,

677
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,220
as you say, it

678
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,470
is indeed the biggest challenge and there is

679
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,299
no secret formula, there are many

680
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:17,490
applications that exist and that are sold

681
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:18,929
that you can install on your

682
00:28:18,929 --> 00:28:20,669
child's phone that monitors the activities

683
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:22,830
that I do and if they receive attacks it

684
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,539
will alert you  There are several

685
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:26,490
applications like that, but we

686
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:28,230
work more on the logic of how parents

687
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,730
have to

688
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:32,370
generate spaces for conversation.

689
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:33,960


690
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,970


691
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,620
the

692
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,539
social networks you use the most which

693
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:41,280
are the platforms you enjoy the most

694
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,470
because you like to be on those

695
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:46,140
platforms why you use  s those media

696
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,850
tries to generate that space of

697
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:49,380
containment those spaces of being

698
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,750
present that they see you also

699
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,700
present their media suddenly for you

700
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,280
technologically very far away try to

701
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,200
investigate try to understand today there is

702
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,030
a spectacular parental

703
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,490
tool called youtube you  You go to

704
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,590
YouTube and you look for a video of what you

705
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,450
want and you will be in ten minutes

706
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,429
super capable of doing the same

707
00:29:08,429 --> 00:29:10,409
as your children do the only difference

708
00:29:10,409 --> 00:29:12,150
that suddenly they spend more time than

709
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,820
you in that application then what we

710
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,750
have to do  It is rather to

711
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,159
internalize ourselves

712
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:19,200
and be present in the same as soon as

713
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,999
our parents or mothers if you

714
00:29:20,999 --> 00:29:23,129
were lucky enough that it was more present in your

715
00:29:23,129 --> 00:29:24,570
life that I was that they met your

716
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:26,519
friends that they knew your environment that they

717
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:27,929
knew where you were going to play

718
00:29:27,929 --> 00:29:29,489
ball where you were going  to do your

719
00:29:29,489 --> 00:29:32,039
activities as we do

720
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:34,409
today that parental challenge we have is

721
00:29:34,409 --> 00:29:35,759
not only to be present in

722
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:37,470
physical activities  that they or they

723
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,570
carry out but also be present in

724
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,549
digital activities in which

725
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:43,440
they are more difficult than more

726
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,320
complex yes but we have to do it

727
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,029
we have to make the effort we have

728
00:29:48,029 --> 00:29:49,950
to know them and be present at

729
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:52,799
sonar you already went to the second

730
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,720
question  is what factors can

731
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,970
help us save lives if there were

732
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:59,970
some factors in particular being

733
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:02,669
supportive there are many situations that

734
00:30:02,669 --> 00:30:04,950
only with a little solidarity

735
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:08,340
are resolved being empathic being able to

736
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,489
listen to close your mouth and listen without

737
00:30:11,489 --> 00:30:13,859
judgment empathy in the

738
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:17,460
emotional connection is  Beyond the phrase of pep

739
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:20,099
on I put myself in your shoes is an

740
00:30:20,099 --> 00:30:22,229
emotional connection and also a

741
00:30:22,229 --> 00:30:24,210
cognitive connection I really want to

742
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:25,859
listen and understand what is

743
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:29,759
happening to you from you from me and I also

744
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:32,220
connect with you and if you feel many

745
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,509
times it goes  to see an image of a person

746
00:30:33,509 --> 00:30:36,149
who is cold and you look at them and it makes you

747
00:30:36,149 --> 00:30:38,849
cold and you and I tell you but gabriel how did

748
00:30:38,849 --> 00:30:41,099
you get cold  it is hot for example

749
00:30:41,099 --> 00:30:43,139
then as because there was a connection

750
00:30:43,139 --> 00:30:46,409
that connection we need today to live and

751
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:48,779
know and connect with the other the connection

752
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:51,479
when there is disconnection happens

753
00:30:51,479 --> 00:30:52,050
fights

754
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:56,460
the cracks and every opening generates

755
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,680
that between whatever is to open the

756
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,240
door to a stranger  You do not know

757
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,240
who is going to enter, look there are

758
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,310
many questions related to how

759
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,500
we can identify cyberbullying,

760
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,010
the most important thing is that we can make

761
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:12,930
perhaps what could be the three

762
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:15,240
main recommendations first for

763
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,760
parents I think about how to identify

764
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,250
if our  son or daughter is suffering from

765
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,410
some harassment and perhaps he also

766
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,510
recommended three specific recommendations for

767
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,080
young people

768
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,310
in the face of parents something that we have to

769
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,780
be very attentive also to digital addiction

770
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,970
is not one thing is to be able to

771
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:34,630
use technology is to have a

772
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:37,070
fantastic profile but  when I only addicted

773
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,780
when they can no longer be disconnected

774
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,580
from when they arrive at a place and there is no

775
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,190
wifi or there is no  3g coverage and it lowers

776
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,260
anxiety when they generally have to be

777
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,700
a person who is being a

778
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,560
victim so the harassment cannot

779
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,150
disconnect from the updates of

780
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,740
their profile because they need to be seeing

781
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,940
what they are saying about him or her

782
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:55,190
then when they cannot drop their

783
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:57,110
phone from the  hand I know daily eye

784
00:31:57,110 --> 00:32:01,280
even to homophobia no mobile phones

785
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,990
phobia is a term that they coined the

786
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,100
gringo

787
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,470
exactly so that is a first

788
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,360
symptom to be able to generate a

789
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,980
conversation

790
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,890
and also here he added the no and we have

791
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,480
to demystify talking to psychologists talk to

792
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,220
us psychologists how to

793
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,510
talk  with a consultant with a

794
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,220
consultant who is going to help me and

795
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,470
suddenly as a father as a friend to be

796
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:23,120
able to structure conversations with your

797
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,040
son it is not about taking your son or

798
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,050
daughter to a psychologist and having it

799
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:29,930
delivered to me resolved, fix it  not the best thing

800
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:32,390
sometimes is if she doesn't want to go

801
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,700
you are of your gender a compensation

802
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,410
help me to structure a

803
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:38,510
conversation with my son  my daughter so

804
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,590
that she can tell me what is really

805
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,180
happening there are many dads who get

806
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,310
caught up in that dilemma he does not want to go

807
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:46,760
soft two and to your question he you that I

808
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,430
support so that he wants to come what do

809
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:51,200
I do so that he wants to talk and  With

810
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,880
regard to young people, we generally

811
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,050
give three tips,

812
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:56,120
the first is when you see situations of

813
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,580
violence ovv has evidence on the screen of

814
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,590
their url addresses,

815
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,920
specific tools that allow you to later

816
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,420
show what happened to a third party

817
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:08,780
to the protocol of the school to a pda to a

818
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,090
ministry  public to a foundation with

819
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,460
us obtain evidence the first step

820
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,320
the second step make sure that the person

821
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,360
who is experiencing this violence is not

822
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,820
alone that he is not locked in his room

823
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,610
alone not only makes sure that he is

824
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:24,530
accompanied if he had a companion friend he

825
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,780
can physically reach  his

826
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:29,810
house accompany him for more than he

827
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,310
scares you for more than gigantic names that

828
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:34,100
hate me call his parents and a person to

829
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,900
his family that you tr  down which

830
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,850
she trusts because the worst they

831
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,200
can be is to be

832
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,200
alone and the third is make sure to

833
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,990
report what is evidence, do not

834
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,669
stay with this information, make sure

835
00:33:46,669 --> 00:33:49,039
to make the report and follow the

836
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,799
protocol of your school that  What

837
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,389
does the school protocol entail? If the

838
00:33:53,389 --> 00:33:54,889
protocol does not work, an education superintendency can be escalated. They

839
00:33:54,889 --> 00:33:56,809
can

840
00:33:56,809 --> 00:33:59,870
contribute to the request for cybercrime. You can

841
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,639
search for us. You can chat with us

842
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:03,110
as a foundation and we will guide you on

843
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,850
how to do that in an efficient way.

844
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:06,409
There are three steps to obtain

845
00:34:06,409 --> 00:34:08,599
evidence to make sure that you are not

846
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:11,540
alone and report it if in fact that was

847
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,399
the question was what to do if we know that

848
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:14,719
someone is suffering cyberbullying

849
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,699
as you said well you have to

850
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:18,379
report it when you have asked obviously you have

851
00:34:18,379 --> 00:34:20,210
to try to have some proof try

852
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:22,310
to show how you said too and

853
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,780
they can write to you they

854
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,609
can even write to us at my

855
00:34:25,609 --> 00:34:28,099
email on my phone  There are not people there who

856
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:30,168
have called me on similar occasions and

857
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:31,520
we will always be willing to

858
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,349
help them especially if something as

859
00:34:33,349 --> 00:34:35,480
important as this I just want to

860
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,550
tell you that the chat is fully

861
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:40,310
on and everyone puts the hashtag I

862
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:42,710
choose to save and indeed I believe  That

863
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,418
the great talk that you did

864
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:46,370
moved everyone

865
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:48,469
and I think your commitment is incredible.

866
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:49,280
I want to congratulate you

867
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,770
again I want to offer you

868
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:54,560
all our support of 8.8 that you can count

869
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,929
on us for anything and

870
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:59,080
congratulate you, nothing else, very good talk

871
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,190
the rest of the  questions were all

872
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:03,170
similar one last question for

873
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:05,870
example I think it is very important is

874
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,360
if it is necessary for example in a certain

875
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:12,020
way to control the social networks of

876
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,060
our children in a certain way to monitor

877
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,390
them

878
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:25,660
they heard me there are many things other

879
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,220
than to congratulate him and tell them what they

880
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,810
count  with all our support

881
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:30,790
the question was whether sometimes as

882
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:33,040
parents it is necessary to monitor  Our

883
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,420
children

884
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,040
considering what it could be that

885
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,930
we do not have so much confidence whatever it is

886
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,670
but if it is necessary what is

887
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,440
your opinion if it is necessary to monitor or not

888
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,790
on social networks for example

889
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,029


890
00:35:52,549 --> 00:35:55,719
now they listen to me

891
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:58,839


892
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:02,990
and now the question is whether  it is

893
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,789
necessary to monitor our children on

894
00:36:04,789 --> 00:36:07,089
social networks

895
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,390
cut the audio

896
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:20,860
I write it to you on whatsapp emanuel

897
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,650
emanuel

898
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:25,500
here we have all the means there I

899
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,900
am listening to you jazz and now yes hello

900
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,890
hello now yes

901
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:33,990
but if it cuts it is cut it

902
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:37,240
is necessary to watch

903
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,710
[Music]

904
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:43,300
our  children in networks

905
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,880
I would say that the word is not to watch

906
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,130
gianella the word I greeted the

907
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:50,020
question if it is necessary to watch I think

908
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:53,140
that to accompany that attempt when

909
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,630
you were 10-15 years old your parents watched

910
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,160
you when you went out to play in the square

911
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,710
until  They watched when you were at

912
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:02,050
your friends' house, they did not accompany you and

913
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:04,120
they accompanied you in different ways,

914
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,250
so the challenge today is how we

915
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,830
accompany you to create a coexistence.

916
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:11,740
Positive digital ia in young people from a

917
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,660
space to enter, then the problem

918
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,760
is that as adults like us we

919
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,710
did not have a digital experience in that

920
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,930
rhyme, it is very difficult for us to empathize and

921
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:22,150
relate and bond, for that reason

922
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,710
tools such as

923
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:26,140
YouTube educate yourself said the first step is

924
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,210
self-educate ourselves to understand

925
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,920
and deliver the tool and the

926
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,150
challenge that parents always do,

927
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:33,160
who installs the application on your

928
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,580
phone, your son or daughter, or you only if

929
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,050
your children install you there,

930
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,420
we have a problem, this is an exam.

931
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,470
very good

932
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:45,619
so we have to work on this logic

933
00:37:45,619 --> 00:37:47,180
of the digital divide sometimes we use it

934
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,770
as an excuse to say if they are

935
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:51,380
digital videos and I am not and it is a fantastic

936
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,880
excuse not to take care of what we

937
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,349
have to take care of, than to

938
00:37:54,349 --> 00:37:56,390
educate ourselves and constantly  stay

939
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:58,640
educated to prevent these situations

940
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,530
and I say it with pain because I did not make

941
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:02,750
that hit I did not educate myself enough

942
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,910
in it  to agree on the interaction and

943
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,800
digital networks that Katy could have and

944
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,050
that is why I did not see what happened to us and today

945
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:10,580
that is not why she motivated me so much to make sure

946
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,349
that other people have this

947
00:38:12,349 --> 00:38:14,180
tool to be able to prevent this

948
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,160
situation and another exam or exercise that

949
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,230
We can give the parents especially

950
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,970
for them what they say today but if my son

951
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:23,540
is addicted to a terrible addiction 12

952
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:26,810
well he deactivated your notifications

953
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:30,580
dad and scotland a social network and skip it,

954
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:35,060
for example a facebook and those

955
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,790
young people a whatsapp and skip whatsapp

956
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:40,790
for  a day where there is

957
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:44,840
a difficult time to put gold a good hour and deactivate

958
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,190
everything

959
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,809
that is, when you look at your phone it will

960
00:38:48,809 --> 00:38:51,180
be blank and there you will

961
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,720
realize what happens to them also

962
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,390
the idea is to accompany but to accompany

963
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:59,470
we have to  connect
