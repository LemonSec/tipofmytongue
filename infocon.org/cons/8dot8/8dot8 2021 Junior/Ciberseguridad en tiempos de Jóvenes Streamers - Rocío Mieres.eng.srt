Also be present at the time of the draw and

16
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,040

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,000


18

talk about a super interesting topic that

23
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:56,730
is cybersecurity in the time of young

24
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,010
streamers, I also missed

25
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,620
saying that Rocío is also a gamer so

26
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,220

a little for those who do not know I am a

34
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,719
sociologist I specialize in

35
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:29,640
video game themes and today  I come to

36
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,850
talk to you about a topic that I

37
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,289
consider is super important given the

38
00:01:34,289 --> 00:01:37,049
increase in digital jobs and

39
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:38,700
trades that have had an

40
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,500
increase in life, a pandemic that is

41
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,710
security in times of extreme youth,

42
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,390
why

43
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,909
because if security in youth

44
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:51,550
streamers

45
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,130
we have new forms of consumption and

46
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,920
new professions we have an increase the

47
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,110
consumption of social networks nowadays the

48
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,420
average of people have a cell phone or

49
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,990
use three different social networks and

50
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,560
social networks include twitch and youtube

51
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,810
and at the same time there has been an explosive

52
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,720
an explosive increase  in what is the

53
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,700
consumption of content through

54
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,710
streaming services

55
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:20,650
at the same time we know that for

56
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,080
example  During the pandemic, use

57
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,680
of streaming platforms that allow the generation of

58
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,810
content has increased incredibly

59
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,940
, therefore it has had an explosion of

60
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,140
200% 300% depending on the platform

61
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,270
because it is very attractive, especially for

62
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,890
a generation like us

63
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,440
millennials who say the 1000 in is of

64
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,620
Between 45 and 25 years, which are the ones that

65
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,340
we go from the blackboard to chalk or marker

66
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,490
there are digital classes as such

67
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:54,160
of the consumption of all these

68
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,590
characteristics and we have for the same

69
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,720
new professions that is the

70
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,240
content generator that goes from who

71
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,280
we have things on instagram

72
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,800
Those of us who tweet do talks who

73
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,590
squeeze games and on the other hand we have

74
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,670
the theme of the professional player

75
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,410
again this has had a boom

76
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,480
through professionalization which

77
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,930
has made it known that it is a new way

78
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,420
of making a living beyond a

79
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,880
hobby through  of generating content and

80
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,820
consuming videogames, let's remember that

81
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,270
Chile has a population of masters the

82
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,990
ses  so many percent 67 If I am not

83
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,770
mistaken that he declares to consume

84
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:41,890
video games mainly between the ages of 10

85
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,030
and 4 and 52, therefore it is a

86
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,240
very, very high and very dense population block

87
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,140


88
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:55,160
then, but that is something that worries us,

89
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,240


90
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,190
we know that the  45 percent of

91
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,410
young people between 13 and 17 years old say that they

92
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,830
have to be online almost

93
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,959
constantly and this is already

94
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:09,120
an aesthetic around the world

95
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,900
given by unicef and in fact this number

96
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,329
has dropped in recent years with the

97
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:18,040
start of use  of social networks,

98
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,540
which is where they are mainly

99
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,310
streaming,

100
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,630
there was a high unsupervised use

101
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,060
of minors including the fact

102
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,610
that for ethical reasons most

103
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,320
social networks ask that their users

104
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,500
be at least 13 years old, that means

105
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,720
that at least  Fewer are starting the

106
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,800
process of generating criteria and every little

107
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,570
finger has to have parental permission,

108
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,720
but what happens to us here,

109
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,100
parents who can usually be

110
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,350
people like us?  others usually do not have a

111
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,360
sense of risk and adequate danger

112
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,729
regarding the use of these

113
00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:00,760
platforms and that I mean that it is

114
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,740
the root of all evils not

115
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,110
absolutely not but we have it so

116
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,760
normalize our day above all and that it

117
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,530
is within the reach of the  cellular the

118
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,080
computer that the news TV

119
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,450
so that we are seeing who we do not usually

120
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,139
work on our good behavior or

121
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:20,470
what is appropriate in its use

122
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,300
with minors, especially because they usually

123
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,460
have an expertise of use and a

124
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,140
form of infrastructure of how to

125
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,729
these applications

126
00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:30,520
or web pages design a much easier use

127
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,639
because it is much more prevented,

128
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,529
we also know that tweets 41 percent

129
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:37,240
of consumers are between 16 and 24

130
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,659
years old, which legally requires that they have

131
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:44,080
over three years to streamer in general, it

132
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,659
continues to have more adult users  for

133
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:48,460
the type of content but there are

134
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,889
much easier platforms and it is like

135
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:54,129
reaching the previous interior point,

136
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:57,069
platforms for example.  plo like periscope or

137
00:05:57,069 --> 00:06:00,039
like facebook where it is the parents

138
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:02,080
who open the accounts for their children

139
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,020
without specific supervision either

140
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,479
to play or to try and they are

141
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:09,339
platforms that are very easy to

142
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:13,449
generate and videos or extreme which

143
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:16,479
generates that if  The child or the adult

144
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,610
wants one as an adult, it complicates them, they do not

145
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,009
have all the safety features in place,

146
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:22,809
for example, only my friends

147
00:06:22,809 --> 00:06:25,990
alone and I, the best friend of my friends,

148
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:29,289
is exposing a part of their

149
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:32,270
intimate life to a space

150
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,790
and something that we have forgotten is

151
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,430
that on the internet it is very difficult to forget,

152
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,450
for the same reason there are bills for the

153
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,720
option of oblivion,

154
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,480
as we also know, 34% of those who

155
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,850
are on the internet are social streamers

156
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,890
or video games, what do I mean by this

157
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,870
one of the most popular categories of

158
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,630
pintxos is just  setting or just

159
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:58,410
chatting face on youtube one of

160
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:01,470
the most popular categories are bio

161
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,380
players that means people who are

162
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,720
like you and who are telling you something about their

163
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,370
u wind is teaching recipes

164
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,170
shows you a city of how much I do not know

165
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,080
what an operation that

166
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,410
bought pencils etc. We also know that

167
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,600
about 80 percent of young people between 12 and

168
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,790
19 years old have access to the internet

169
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,470
mainly through mobile devices.

170
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,890
Most of the

171
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,540
streaming consumption is not done from the computer,

172
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,490
it is done from the cell phone

173
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,560
and it is intended that at least one

174
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,660
in four has had an experience of

175
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,750
harassment, according to the unicef data, and that is

176
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,910
what they spoke in one of the three

177
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:42,690
previous lists that normalization is very easy,

178
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,729
we have not only in the

179
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:46,860
digital space but in the space,

180
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,100
let's say

181
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:53,360
highly socialized analogue, forms that are aggressive

182
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,690
and making it violent or being violent in the

183
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,670
face of nothing less than a physical action

184
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:01,920
of aggression towards another with damage

185
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,530
that are totally  normalized and

186
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,630
sandra adults to young people or young people to

187
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,370
pairs

188
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:11,850
and this especially certain groups that are

189
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:15,360
much more vulnerable to this normalization

190
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,479
They leave them a space in the hierarchy of

191
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,600
the line where they receive much more

192
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,250
aggression than

193
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,410
any other person could do we move away

194
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,160
from the ironic mem will transform I do not know

195
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,440
very small things that can be from there is

196
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,909
one more photo that of Sunday transforms

197
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:34,169
this into  a meme and it is the internal joke

198
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:36,750
but we all agree on this and

199
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,150
what happens with the clips and what happens when

200
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,309
you are already exposing your privacy to

201
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:45,600
strangers according to save the children in

202
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,660
2019 51.2 percent of children were

203
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,710
exposed to material  violent or sexual 34

204
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,410
39 points 63 percent were harassed

205
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,620
once and 27 point 43 percent two or

206
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,320
more times and this harassment can occur

207
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,320
from known or unknown peers

208
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,260
through different types of social networks

209
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,150
again there may be, for example,

210
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,839
tweets

211
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,760
For example, the use or social

212
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,250
media motivator, that is, that is what

213
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,900
makes young people use the Internet and that they

214
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,640
consume the type of production that they

215
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,840
consume when they are between 16 and 18

216
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,150
years old.  In general, what is consumed is

217
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:31,290
to contain entertainment, fill

218
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,890
free time and be we can say up to

219
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,230
date with the news, it is better to generate

220
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,279
a network of contacts

221
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:43,759
that comes when they are adults,

222
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:46,009
the order changes a little more, but

223
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:49,579
it is not very different and also  We know,

224
00:09:49,579 --> 00:09:53,269
for example, that boys between 16 and 18

225
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:58,129
years old, 49% connect to YouTube to

226
00:09:58,129 --> 00:10:00,949
Instagram to Facebook to WhatsApp more than

227
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:05,800
once to share content,

228
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:11,100
already knowing this we

229
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,770
have what I call the duality between

230
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,380
what is public and what is  The

231
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,330
private world of content generation

232
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,450
tends to prefer a recognizable face,

233
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,040
basically who generates content that

234
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,170
is under the premise that it could be

235
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,720
your next best friend who is a little

236
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,820
cooler than you, someone with whom you

237
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,480
can feel a certain level of empathy

238
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,340
is what  ideally we also have what can

239
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,830
be called consuming only that we are going to

240
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,170
talk about later on,

241
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,240
said empathy is often achieved by

242
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,519
showing part of daily life  and

243
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:50,200
the life of each one a person who is

244
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,149
like you can recognize their problems

245
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:55,930
their happiness could be you this may

246
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:59,500
have a problem of contradiction with

247
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,230
the right to private life because

248
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,269
we all have the right to have our

249
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:06,250
privacy and that it is not invaded but what

250
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,660
It happens when we are the ones who

251
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,880
decide to expose it because we are not

252
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,250
aware of the same as if it is already

253
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:15,250
a complex and super delicate issue with one

254
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,100
that is an adult with the children who are

255
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,850
just generating the criteria is much

256
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,850
more complex especially I work a lot

257
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,579
with video games and  Many of the people

258
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:31,360
who have a high or even

259
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,519
risky consumption of video games or

260
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,199
material related to

261
00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:38,230
video game consumption has to do with the fact that it is a

262
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,779
way out of a space that

263
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:43,180
is usually violent or aggressive towards the

264
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,940
person and on the internet it allows

265
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:50,220
find more people like you

266
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,290
the problem with this is that it is like

267
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:56,220
flipping a coin which means you feel

268
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,300
like one on the internet because the pr  The beginning

269
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,220
of anonymity effectively allows many

270
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,860
people to be what they really are or to say

271
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,470
things that they really think and given the

272
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:10,320
construction of the same it is very complex to

273
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,000
know how much there are comments that are

274
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,280
ironic regarding certain

275
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,330
topics

276
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,490
that means that people looking for

277
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:19,620
groups or support networks are  much

278
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,980
easier for them to suddenly fall into the networks

279
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,260
of people who are dedicated to predating

280
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,889
vulnerable people

281
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:31,639
then as far as we show because

282
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:36,019
there is also a deep and complex cut

283
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:39,379
with respect to what reality is and

284
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:41,119
here I am going to stop a bit by putting

285
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:44,329
myself in my  sociologist hat and delving into

286
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:46,939
this we usually think that

287
00:12:46,939 --> 00:12:49,009
reality is like analog space what

288
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:50,779
I can play with who I can

289
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:54,019
talk live is how it is to leave your case

290
00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:55,699
talking to people who are there that

291
00:12:55,699 --> 00:12:56,809
is reality that is what has

292
00:12:56,809 --> 00:13:00,829
repercussions  But virtual reality is

293
00:13:00,829 --> 00:13:03,919
not like the technological space, but

294
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:06,829
everything that happens that we upload

295
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:07,790
to the internet

296
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,730
is  The sense of company that we receive

297
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:13,639
and give from consuming production

298
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:15,529
through stream is that I talk to the chat

299
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:18,350
I can see the piece the space tells me

300
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,850
things they play the same games that I

301
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:23,269
also have an impact it is also real

302
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:26,269
and influencing life  In the psyche

303
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:28,879
and in the socio-emotional space of the

304
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:31,489
person many times we talk about these

305
00:13:31,489 --> 00:13:33,730
characteristics with respect to

306
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,070
influencers who what they do is that

307
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:40,370
they sell you products that sell

308
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,440
lifestyles but nevertheless when

309
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,570
a community is generated, the communities

310
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,130
because you feel that you have  Something in

311
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,530
common with that person and you are already

312
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:51,560
exhibiting many times and that is what

313
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,060
happens when being one of the new

314
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,340
professions of the future, many of the

315
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,130
adults naively leave

316
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,840
young people a little neglected with respect to

317
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,520
already want to be a streamer than to be

318
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,550
YouTube  to do it and it has happened to me and I

319
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:10,430
scream in the sky and that please I

320
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,320
am prudish with the subject and only accept

321
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,180
the overuse of videoj  Games and

322
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,460
these platforms in a good way and

323
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,700
use for education I see children of

324
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,450
5 or 6 years streaming at 12

325
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:26,060
at night one day of the week that child

326
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,880
should be sleeping there there is a

327
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,010
concern of a responsible adult and

328
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,310
caregiver who should be behind

329
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,320
explaining issues of

330
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,110
safety criteria and caring for childhood

331
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,350
if an adolescent is a little more

332
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,540
relaxed it is assumed that there are certain

333
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,010
characteristics of care that we have

334
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:50,839
seen and that we will talk about later but it

335
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:53,459
requires an involvement is a

336
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,019
person who was already beginning to have

337
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,740
a lot of criteria  more trained

338
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,250
but it is also necessary to support and

339
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,530
strengthen everything that is happening in

340
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,570
what we can say in virtual reality

341
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,580
there are many people who have lost

342
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,130
educational scholarships who have been thrown out of

343
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,290
their homes who have lost jobs or

344
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,910
even who have gained jobs and

345
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:16,210
opportunities  of the same then

346
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:19,850
under is say technological bubble

347
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,010
where to be generator of contents be

348
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:25,490
stre  amer is something desirable because you are

349
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,230
an influence because they have gifts

350
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,910
because people see you, they give you feedback,

351
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,130
usually the feedback at first

352
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,980
is usually quite positive, but what

353
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:39,320
do we do when we are exposing

354
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,900
our private lives a lot to generate this

355
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,340
empathy with people who are not

356
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,830
visualizing when  we told the

357
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,980
streamer about our private life in

358
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,050
an act of vulnerability he was

359
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,580
exposing us to grooming we are

360
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:57,910
exposing him to behaviors that are

361
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,820
ultimately predatory by vulnerable people

362
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,660


363
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:06,050
and all this has an effect and the effect

364
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,610
is not only what we have seen of

365
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,379
depression  or anguish but also

366
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:12,110
social ostracism then because there are

367
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,610
people who are going to like it and people who are

368
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,790
not going to like it etc.

369
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,139
then

370
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:21,759
social relationships I do not know if any

371
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,019
of you had ever heard

372
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:25,350
this term but it is something that happens a

373
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:28,089
lot when you are  very

374
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:30,100
content generator or when you are a

375
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,499
content consumer before I spoke a lot these

376
00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:35,589
rela

377
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:37,389


378
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:40,089
There is a certain degree of

379
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:42,970
exposure of their private life so it is

380
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:46,230
not intimate outside of their professional life, it

381
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,420
is highly exposed to us and

382
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,970
we consume it is a bit what we lived.  the

383
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,170
contract of when we started to

384
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,490
exterminate and we tell how the

385
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,139
week went you did not want you to be eating

386
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:59,079
there are certain levels of depth that

387
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:01,540
we are showing how

388
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,790
we expose ourselves to the people who are

389
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,648
consuming it and consume us with some

390
00:17:05,648 --> 00:17:09,010
regularity we are part of their

391
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,648
life  Think about it, those who follow youtubers

392
00:17:11,648 --> 00:17:14,679
when it is not a video when not only

393
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:15,819
are we getting used to it every

394
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:17,980
Friday when accessing their life late and

395
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,169
the video is not there, we feel that

396
00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:22,000
feeling of

397
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,980
emptiness sometimes even abandon with some

398
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,069
people because that person is already part

399
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:30,490
of our daily life  for us we

400
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,040
know it that does not mean that the

401
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,050
content creator necessarily

402
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:38,080
recognizes and knows who  It is you and that

403
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,690
can be dangerous in the sense that

404
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,740
we do not know who is

405
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:48,550
consuming the content so many

406
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,860
times or the problem has to do

407
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:54,640
with a human error failure in the

408
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,860
randomness of those who could consume

409
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,620
this type of content, for example we

410
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,080
can  find with people who are

411
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,490
apologists for

412
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,929
food problems the example of the Peruvian community

413
00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:09,539


414
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:11,460
what has to do with anorexia that

415
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,559
generates content and consumes content

416
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,289
or what happens suddenly with people who

417
00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:18,179
generate and consume content for minors

418
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:20,580
and in between is putting content that

419
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,299
It is of radical ideologies and that

420
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:27,019
ethically they are not considered as

421
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:30,869
allowing them as Nazi themes, not

422
00:18:30,869 --> 00:18:32,519
treating it from a critical thinking point of view,

423
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:33,960
let us treat

424
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,399
this historiographically in a

425
00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:38,600
discussion but rather apologies

426
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,120
and that means that we must be

427
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,760
careful and especially with those who we

428
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,770
interact in  social networks

429
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,330
most people manage to meet

430
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:51,410
couples  and friends with very

431
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:54,410
deep relationships and who help them in life

432
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,280
through the internet

433
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,130
but that is not without a risk in the same

434
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,450
way that you have a risk of

435
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,860
not stopping party of going to a disco

436
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:04,389
in a cafe and knowing something

437
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,950
So for me personally, that I

438
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,870
doctor do scientific dissemination

439
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:14,000
, people on the street have suddenly stopped me and

440
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,500
the shock of what happened is how

441
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,660
someone greets me as if I were a

442
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,850
lifelong friend because I am part of

443
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,039
everyday life  of some people but I

444
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:23,840
did not recognize the person and it was

445
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,789
quite a big scare and that can happen

446
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:29,539
especially with girls or young people better said

447
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:32,479
then again here we have an issue

448
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:35,659
of what the human factor does to

449
00:19:35,659 --> 00:19:37,940
us humans need

450
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,009
social interaction to  Feeling

451
00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:42,769
recognized part of knowing our

452
00:19:42,769 --> 00:19:44,690
existence has to do with who

453
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:47,359
recognizes me and in times of the pandemic

454
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:49,070
there has been an increase in people who do their

455
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:51,169
podcasts that they are trying to do their

456
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:53,809
SME or who are  trying to get into the

457
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:58,070
writing and put there and to generate

458
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,989
this empathy begins to tell things about

459
00:19:59,989 --> 00:20:03,919
one but there is no filter or what is it

460
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,950
that I show there are people who nothing children who

461
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,929
tell the problems of their house

462
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:10,309
there are people that our interior of their

463
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:13,549
house your neighborhood or where you are and that

464
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:16,489
generates a problem and the problem is that there

465
00:20:16,489 --> 00:20:17,629
may be someone with enough

466
00:20:17,629 --> 00:20:21,289
time or not the best

467
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:25,609
mental health condition who could look for you and appear at

468
00:20:25,609 --> 00:20:29,989
your house and send you things for example there are

469
00:20:29,989 --> 00:20:32,119
a couple of cases that  I knew people

470
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:33,679
even before this streamer started, they

471
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,759


472
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:38,739
found the house and threw things

473
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:41,230
or gifts over the fence that is

474
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,220
super invasive

475
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,809
that can even be problematic

476
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,549
because many of these people

477
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:48,090
feel what this human interaction was telling them

478
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:52,210
for social  feel that since

479
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,610
they are putting an effort into this

480
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,739
relationship with someone they know and

481
00:20:56,739 --> 00:20:59,619
may have an emotionally intimate relationship

482
00:20:59,619 --> 00:21:03,879
you owe it to them and

483
00:21:03,879 --> 00:21:06,519
react  in a violent way when

484
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:09,820
that something is not there or there is simply the

485
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,289
troll and the people who are stupid because of

486
00:21:11,289 --> 00:21:15,309
this stupid then the biggest problem

487
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:18,690
we can find in this space is

488
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:22,910
how much complex sensitive information

489
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:26,590
we are going to share

490
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,750
in general what is recommended and what

491
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,190
I think  other exhibitors have also

492
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:33,880
said it is no photos with

493
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,529
school uniforms no photos or stream in

494
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:41,740
places too close to their home they do not

495
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,590
show their address they do not share their

496
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:48,700
phone number they do not share and

497
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,690
ideally the full name because if they

498
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,669
are lucky it will only be a troll  If

499
00:21:54,669 --> 00:21:58,029
they can't find a stalker and the

500
00:21:58,029 --> 00:22:01,270
problem with that is that the biggest

501
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:04,210
risk gap is the human factor, we

502
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:06,760
who put in I don't know they made sure to

503
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,409
close the webcam they didn't make sure to

504
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:10,960
close the webcam where they put the

505
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,029
keys to their computer I remember  The

506
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:14,799
clear ones on your computer and they have post-it

507
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,929
is showing the school schedule

508
00:22:16,929 --> 00:22:21,190
that you are showing and it is

509
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,230
something that is  scapa is almost as if it were

510
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,120
water because we do not think twice

511
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,670
because we are learning to live

512
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,830
with a technology that is advancing

513
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,360
much faster than we

514
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,280
are aware of what is

515
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,610
advancing

516
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:38,360
then returning a little to the level of

517
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,600
things many times it happens that  It is not

518
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,500
even the child who generates and uploads the

519
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,150
content but rather the parents in the

520
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,980
bauble

521
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,500
on the school path where they are with

522
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,150
those who meet on behalf of their

523
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:57,360
friends and then there is a certain level of

524
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,400
human factor and that I have even spent myself

525
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,690
as a teacher

526
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:05,270


527
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:07,640


528
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,930


529
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:12,710
what happens when people think

530
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:15,080
they turned off these devices but it has

531
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,330
continued is tremendous and the problem is that

532
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,160
it has occurred and especially with people

533
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,920
youth is the unintentional production of

534
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,900
sexual material or exposure

535
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,580
of everyday privacy

536
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,740
someone forgot to close the microphone

537
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,039
or close  The webcam and begins to do

538
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:34,169
things in his daily life and so we are

539
00:23:34,169 --> 00:23:37,350
lucky that a student has not passed and it is

540
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,840
like he does not like a note and that is like

541
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,210
today the bad-tempered teacher Blake asks him

542
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:47,200
that is

543
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,269
a painful learning a little

544
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:51,820
embarrassing but what happens for example

545
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:54,730
if there is a fight in your house or if it reaches

546
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:56,860
your partner in case you have a partner and

547
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,320
you start to have intimacy these are

548
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,289
complex contents that can lead to

549
00:24:02,289 --> 00:24:05,100
demands for unnecessary exposure

550
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,200
again with people who are

551
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,450
minors that means that we

552
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,070
assume that they do not have a

553
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:15,460
formed criterion and that they are much more vulnerable

554
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:19,179
to influences from others, which again is not the

555
00:24:19,179 --> 00:24:21,909
fault of those who are vulnerable but rather it

556
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:24,000
is always the fault of those who seek to violate

557
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,690
or prey on these people are much

558
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,399
more  prone to grooming we have

559
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:33,090
seen more than ever the space of

560
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:35,769
famous youtubers famous streamers who

561
00:24:35,769 --> 00:24:38,049
end up grooming guys

562
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:40,059
who follow them until they transform into

563
00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:41,549
p  arejas

564
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:45,029
and errors of existence the sexting of

565
00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:47,460
exposure of chose things or

566
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,389
cyber-bullying

567
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:54,330
then again at the level of

568
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:57,040
recommendations and that I regret to say

569
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,380
this is not an easier way

570
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:04,540
because no type is to get involved that

571
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,370
means that if you are  the

572
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:08,620
responsible adult you are the older brother is

573
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:12,760
the uncle godfather mother etc. it is you

574
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,550
who has a judge one who has to

575
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:18,280
sit down with the much younger person

576
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:22,540
to explain not on a subject that the

577
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,510
penalties of hell not on a subject that

578
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:28,090
everything  the world is bad

579
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:30,580
yes or yes they will harass you but there are

580
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,880
certain risks and how to handle the

581
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,040
overexposure that we are

582
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,380
doing in this way

583
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:42,490
in that sense includes being careful to say for

584
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:44,710
example that I remember the time

585
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,920
carving in real time at all times

586
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,660
where are you carve your address put or

587
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,880
label people that has your family

588
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,000
put or label or not blur and

589
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,130
public images that you are

590
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:03,220
showing of your children of your brothers

591
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,710
if  someone you do not know asks for

592
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:11,289
photos that they do not consider appropriate or of

593
00:26:11,289 --> 00:26:14,620
a sexual nature, you must have

594
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,289
a trusted adult person who

595
00:26:17,289 --> 00:26:19,659
can tell what is happening

596
00:26:19,659 --> 00:26:22,510
and who is able to recognize where

597
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:25,090
the buttons to block this person are

598
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:28,600
to  That he does not continue to have access, such as not

599
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,260
engaging in these dynamics, especially

600
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,570
because when you are generating

601
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:37,240
content for example live and they begin

602
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,240
to have an audience that is not your

603
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,740
three friends who always follow you

604
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,630
everywhere

605
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:45,670
that are not people you know, no

606
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,980
They are no friends and they start to give you

607
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,980
super positive feedback in some cases

608
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,460
you start to be able to monetize your content it

609
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:57,190
is very easy to feel that you have an

610
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,350
obligation with a lot of people that

611
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,990
you do not really know and that you do not have

612
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:05,110
a real obligation with them.

613
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,330
you want to become a professional with

614
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:09,820
regard to generating content make a

615
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,460
streamer

616
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,909
your obligation to the public is to

617
00:27:14,909 --> 00:27:17,789
generate the content and go sub  Going it and

618
00:27:17,789 --> 00:27:21,240
not uploading risky content you are not

619
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,730
obliged to be friends with these people and

620
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:26,039
many times this reality clash is

621
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:28,260
highly complex because it feels like

622
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:32,190
a betrayal you are not responsible

623
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:35,669
for that feeling you have to have it super

624
00:27:35,669 --> 00:27:37,460
super clear

625
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,919
after teaching criteria which ones  They are

626
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,950
behaviors that can be problematic and

627
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:46,270
not problematic and in this I mean be

628
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:49,549
careful with uploading photos and I regret it

629
00:27:49,549 --> 00:27:52,790
because this should not be the case

630
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,770
with the clothes with which some go up in

631
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,930
places again who is guide

632
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:58,670
where they do it

633
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:01,270
at the same time schedules  I consume

634
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,650
many of the problems that are generated

635
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,810
with young streamers, he released when he

636
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,430
starts to monetize what is, for

637
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,710
example, a pitch session so that it

638
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,750
can be really monetizable or

639
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,450
you start to have a certain drag has

640
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:17,480
to last between 3 and 4 hours and the

641
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,940
best schedules begin  around 8

642
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,980
o'clock at night

643
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:24,560
a child who is not an adolescent should not

644
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,180
be awake at the time or be

645
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,900
exposed that cant  ity of screen time

646
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:32,330
we are talking about that in general

647
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,549
the recommended screen time for

648
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:36,620
example for children up to 6 years and a maximum

649
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:39,250
one hour of screen

650
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:42,670
for government reasons we can do

651
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:45,220
it today because the classes

652
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,470
are through the screen but what happens  by

653
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,330
cell phone what happens with the television what

654
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,179
happens with the computer

655
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:53,770
after being a teenager there is a whole

656
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:56,049
issue that still has to do with the

657
00:28:56,049 --> 00:28:58,390
plasticity of the brain with respect to

658
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:01,660
certain issues of hormonal regulation

659
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,450
of sleep quality eating problems

660
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:08,410
self-image and social interaction and

661
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:11,590
even  everything that has to do with

662
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,620
various consumptions

663
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,870
then it means that there has to be

664
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:19,960
an adult involved and I do not mean

665
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,510
from the perspective that we usually

666
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,299
confuse that doing helicopter father

667
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:27,490
this is not being harassing your son and

668
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:29,890
tell me what are you doing

669
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:32,799
we all went  adolescents and those who are

670
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,929
adolescents who are watching know

671
00:29:34,929 --> 00:29:36,730
that this type of reaction generates

672
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:38,320
is that n  or it matters the stations with

673
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,330
station and I go the snot but it generates an

674
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:42,850
adverse reaction of trying not to

675
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:47,830
feel investigated or violated in that

676
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,450
sense therefore it is much easier

677
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:53,200
for me to start having to hide

678
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,860
behaviors

679
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:58,250
while if I have a relationship

680
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:04,030
in which  I have a healthy relationship

681
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:07,170
and relate correctly with a

682
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,910
responsible adult who many times does not

683
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,710
even have to be the father,

684
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,030
suddenly it can be an uncle or an older

685
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:15,240
brother with whom I feel confident that he

686
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,120
will not judge me and that he can

687
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,530
explain and help me  with certain

688
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,720
situations it is much more likely that

689
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,270
that adolescent or that child can take

690
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:26,180
a better control that is much more

691
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:31,970
protected from certain risk behaviors

692
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:36,040
again not to reveal intimate information

693
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,880
which is complex because especially in

694
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,970
a stage of so high heatstroke that

695
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:46,470
we are having  As the

696
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:49,540
pandemic currently has the highest rates

697
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:52,390
of anxiety depression, especially in

698
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:55,320
young people, the level of suicide is important.

699
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,150
Before there are many people who are

700
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:02,550
looking to feel part of something

701
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:06,540
this something before was I do not know the

702
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:09,360
traditional church family to political parties

703
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,550
but today they are spaces that do not

704
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:14,610
necessarily resolve this, which

705
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:17,970
later means that it is one

706
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:21,800
of the easiest spaces and  accessible

707
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,720
and that again can expose us to

708
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,960
very good things or very bad things and the

709
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,770
last thing I am going to close

710
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:34,390
about

711
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:38,740
is the differentiation that must be had and

712
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,480
awareness of what a

713
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,130
content generator is of what a

714
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:48,130
professional player is who  Many times it

715
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,540
has happened that adults come

716
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:53,650
with this and it is that he is a

717
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:55,990
professional player who would be a

718
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,910
content engineer or is going to exterminate or has a

719
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:00,550
high consumption of digital technology, he is

720
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,350
a person who is going to be training in

721
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,880
the same way he would  for

722
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,550
example a traditional player

723
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,830
while a content creator is

724
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,960
generating content and it is not the same

725
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,750
many times we confuse it in es  Tas

726
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:16,170
like

727
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:19,150
super cool new digital professional career searches that we are

728
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,620
talking about and that move a lot of

729
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,800
money and that the brands that the lights

730
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,830
are not the same

731
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:28,669
is not the same and in this space something

732
00:32:28,669 --> 00:32:32,630
is already very worrying and delicate again it

733
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:37,159
has to do  With a vulnerable group

734
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:40,010
that are girls, I do not say that

735
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,220
children or boys do not have it, but there is a

736
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:47,570
lot that the erotic capitalization

737
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,850
of women's bodies that means

738
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,980
in the same logic of fights, for

739
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,720
example, that women enter

740
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,809
Thanks to the discoteque they are bodies that

741
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:59,269
are consumed and consumed in a form

742
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:02,539
of content not necessarily suitable

743
00:33:02,539 --> 00:33:06,620
for girls who are minors, which

744
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,620
means that they may inadvertently be

745
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:12,010
generating child pornographic material

746
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:15,860
and that it is being consumed, it is not

747
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,350
uncommon to see, for example, on networks  social

748
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:21,380
because when it is squeezed, a

749
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,149
combo of three social media platforms is made

750
00:33:23,149 --> 00:33:27,559
in the form of having a level

751
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:30,860
of impact that is generated  to an account or

752
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:34,009
on twitter or on instagram where

753
00:33:34,009 --> 00:33:36,259
videos have been uploaded images my

754
00:33:36,259 --> 00:33:38,539
daily life drinking coffee that the beach

755
00:33:38,539 --> 00:33:42,350
etc. that community takes for the

756
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:45,289
consumption of in stream and then a community is made

757
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:48,019
by disk the problem is that

758
00:33:48,019 --> 00:33:49,519
in this effort  Many things can happen

759
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,580
badly

760
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,429
and the contents that tend to rise much

761
00:33:55,429 --> 00:33:57,409
higher end up being content of

762
00:33:57,409 --> 00:34:00,950
an ironic nature where a person is

763
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,929
consumed by the cleanz he is giving or

764
00:34:02,929 --> 00:34:04,460
by the morbidness he is giving, it is already

765
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,700
where he can take it with respect

766
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,409
then we have people having an

767
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:10,219
anxiety crisis

768
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:13,159
matt downs in addis that

769
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:15,710
everyone's patience and this is

770
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,719
constantly fed is like and I am going to give more

771
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,399
bits for this and I am going to speak and I heard him

772
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:22,639
say to viralize and generate content in

773
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,649
relation to suffering  of a person or

774
00:34:24,649 --> 00:34:27,589
the vulnerability of a person in

775
00:34:27,589 --> 00:34:29,389
anyone who creates cds tell me it

776
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:32,239
is not far from that especially with a

777
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,149
reaction that is that type of content is

778
00:34:35,149 --> 00:34:37,730
highly  e viral isable therefore there is

779
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:39,800
a sensation of fame when really

780
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,129
infamy is not the fame it is that you want to

781
00:34:42,129 --> 00:34:44,179
have

782
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:47,030
but it remains in a constant spiral there is

783
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:52,969
self-flogging in the exhibition there is

784
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:55,030
a serious deterioration of mental health

785
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:59,390
exposed there to which we do not want

786
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:02,900
expose young people and especially children

787
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,020
of the content I eat one is because they

788
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,480
can bring offers of all kinds

789
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,760
if this meltdown and then what

790
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,859
happens when there is nothing left because it is a

791
00:35:12,859 --> 00:35:16,609
little more ephemeral later there is the

792
00:35:16,609 --> 00:35:20,359
creation of young streamers when they

793
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:22,579
start  to be able to monetize what

794
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:24,530
happens with the donations that are there

795
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:27,859
when people start to put what I do know

796
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:31,910
is a 10,000-bit bait if you raise your

797
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:34,430
leg, which is like I'm not going to ask you to

798
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,829
be pornographic material but I am

799
00:35:36,829 --> 00:35:39,470
asking you for erotic material without  You

800
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,599
are realizing what happens with those

801
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,740
people, especially a state of

802
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,440
vulnerability that is, I don't know, I want to, it may

803
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,660
be I need to pay the bill with that I want

804
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:50,440
the next

805
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,830
What happens with this type of content what

806
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,300
happened with this type of interaction

807
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,000
I do it I do not do it what happens with the people

808
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,250
who are doing it when they are

809
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:01,650
adults or of legal age we are in other

810
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:02,970
discussions because there is supposed to be a

811
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:04,410
criterion formed by  what happens when

812
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:05,640
we are talking to teenagers

813
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,030
about it

814
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:09,850
and later it is when we go

815
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:11,860
to record groups where

816
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,990
one can also premiere but is also much

817
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:16,170
more prone to the transfer of information

818
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:19,450
to expose oneself or meet

819
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:21,910
moderators that can be

820
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:24,280
dangerous or risky complexes  that they can

821
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,580
be in a grooming mode with

822
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:30,550
respect to young spectators or seeing

823
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:34,220
if there is someone vulnerable

824
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,170
then there is the whole

825
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,190
cybersecurity issue that I cannot find

826
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:39,290
with misogenic issues I do not put a

827
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:41,090
more classist violent transport

828
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:43,380
etc.

829
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:46,470
and there are things that are me  I agree in my

830
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,869
adolescent days when at most one

831
00:36:48,869 --> 00:36:50,990
had messenger

832
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:53,300
and that the biggest problem was the

833
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,640
abu  Laughter that it started and add

834
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,260
email to the suddenly you

835
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,030
met people and you accepted

836
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:02,119
in that it was a shot in the air that

837
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:03,619
could not be found but there was no

838
00:37:03,619 --> 00:37:06,110
real sense of risk because this is

839
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:08,990
virtual being virtual has certain

840
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:12,100
characteristics  but it does not and real

841
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:15,140
later we had the subject of there they

842
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:18,740
hacked me and the hack had been something

843
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,650
as easy as you put the

844
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:23,540
email to the person who forgot their

845
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:27,640
password and their question d

846
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,520
how to say to recover this

847
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,710
information was what is the name  of my

848
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,660
pet and the person had made a

849
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,700
photoblog of the pet uploading all

850
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,970
kinds of information again, many of

851
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:42,250
the cybersecurity gap we have

852
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:43,900
has to do with a

853
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,300
human engineering or human factor issue that we

854
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,910
are giving more information about the  that

855
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:51,940
we should and there is also normalize to

856
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:55,630
be constantly consuming 24/7 from

857
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:58,360
a computer from a cell phone is not

858
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,690
exposed to more risky behaviors because  r not

859
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:03,490
understanding the type of risks we are

860
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,960
running or how far we are

861
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,340
running

862
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:09,160
that one could say all

863
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,230
the information about me is already bulky but what happens

864
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:13,540
when you already start to have a certain

865
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,490
level of recognition is generating

866
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:18,220
content people start to follow you  and

867
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,080
you can be stopped by a stranger on

868
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,370
the street that you do not know if it is how you

869
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:22,990
really liked my content or

870
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:25,570
a truck is going to put you in a truck suddenly threats start to arrive

871
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:28,240
thriller oo you

872
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,720
are already exposing people around

873
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,300
you therefore  the basic recommendations

874
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,940
is as if you want to be a streamer to have

875
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,970
a background as neutral as possible that says

876
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:44,520
the least about your location be

877
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:48,660
careful with the accuracy with which italy

878
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,610
geopositioning if you say it is not a

879
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:54,790
ramón commune or metropolitan region there will not

880
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,200
be so much problem when you say

881
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,420
street so much with so many

882
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,819
if the air drops inside it is going to say that it

883
00:39:00,819 --> 00:39:02,589
will be then do not say

884
00:39:02,589 --> 00:39:04,869
exact times that you are going to go unless

885
00:39:04,869 --> 00:39:07,540
we  They are inviting as an influence that

886
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,940
is already work, it is something else

887
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,099
and be careful with what one says

888
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:13,990
because an engineer does not realize

889
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:16,359
these relationships for social with these

890
00:39:16,359 --> 00:39:17,890
people who have an empathy that

891
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:19,839
generates a space that one feels

892
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,839
close to and in that  one finishing more

893
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:25,420
information than one should give in

894
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:28,270
a complex and dangerous way and

895
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:30,190
again if you are an adult it

896
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:32,609
is in the knowledge of a child to

897
00:39:32,609 --> 00:39:35,930
explain to him talk about these risks

898
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:38,150
do not worry someone asks you for something

899
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,710
wrong that you do not want to do

900
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:44,180
is  well block and delete and report

901
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,700
and it is not the fault of the person who is

902
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,400
being violated in that sense,

903
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:53,090
what else can I tell you, well, it's a bit of

904
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,370
that and also if you are going to squeeze, try

905
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:58,280
to make it a space where the rest does not enter

906
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,590
by chance  of your family in

907
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:01,970
an intimate space you never know

908
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:04,670
the step in pajamas here your parents arrive

909
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:07,670
anything so that is what I

910
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,620
could tell you about what my talk of

911
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,470
cybersecurity in a space of young

912
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:15,279
streamers

913
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,450
rocío rocío rocío that has impressed

914
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:24,680
many sectors of what one would expect to

915
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:28,120
find how you are a pleasure to greet you

916
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:31,730
today well and incidentally is that as I said

917
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,980
there are many factors that one does not take

918
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,060
the risk that you have them  super

919
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,670
naturalized then it goes from me

920
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,980
the selphy has happened to me I do not know in a square it

921
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,450
is how I took back selfish and there is already

922
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:43,280
someone like I recognize that place you are

923
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,450
in both with so much and it is like

924
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:51,210
and there is the case of redit of the famous

925
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:54,270
flag of  chile guztien that was

926
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:58,110
even what is called this triangulated

927
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:00,150
to be able to locate it within the entire

928
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:02,070
geographical plane of the usa and that was

929
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:05,040
done by the not exact user one never

930
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,960
knows suddenly it may be people who are

931
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,510
simply bored and some like

932
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,480
holy hates and also one  do not know people with

933
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,520
other spaces for example when they

934
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,680
start to harass girls like me I already

935
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,820
have your information

936
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:21,140
and she has a problematic photo of you

937
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,430
send me more or else and  I start to release

938
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:25,830
the information and it is a vicious circle and

939
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:28,980
adolescents are harassed a lot because it is

940
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,630
a still very vulnerable space

941
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:33,150
where one needs social interaction

942
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:35,520
and parents and one wants

943
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,890
someone to tell another you are so cool the

944
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:41,290
typical one you are  So mature for your age

945
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:44,920
are those certain things that occur that although

946
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,260
they have to do with cyber and

947
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,990
digital, the human factor is still

948
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:53,010
the most complex part

949
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,690
thinking about the same thing and I have a

950
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:56,010
question which is to leave the orchard that

951
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:57,750
me  He speaks for him only because we are

952
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:59,850
all very close listening to the talk

953
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,600
how sociology sees cybersecurity

954
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,619
as it is understood

955
00:42:05,619 --> 00:42:08,200
today, sociology has been working on

956
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,359
issues from cybersecurity since

957
00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:12,940
the internet started a bit for those who do

958
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:15,549
not know there is a whole issue of generation

959
00:42:15,549 --> 00:42:17,380
of interactive content  that has been

960
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:19,539
studied since at least the 80s

961
00:42:19,539 --> 00:42:23,130
there is also a security issue because

962
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:25,359
this said a bit what we are

963
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,160
talking about but one of  the main

964
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,109
sources of support for women who were

965
00:42:29,109 --> 00:42:30,670
being violated by couples having

966
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:32,499
children and who needed a support network

967
00:42:32,499 --> 00:42:35,289
either through internet groups

968
00:42:35,289 --> 00:42:38,019
with other women generating a

969
00:42:38,019 --> 00:42:40,869
support network of is how another woman is has to

970
00:42:40,869 --> 00:42:43,059
be less dangerous than  I stay with my

971
00:42:43,059 --> 00:42:45,249
aggressor and these networks are generated, which is

972
00:42:45,249 --> 00:42:47,079
like and I take care of the child and here you have

973
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:49,180
diapers and food, so they talk

974
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:51,609
about that and especially when we are

975
00:42:51,609 --> 00:42:53,019
talking about the internet and the certain

976
00:42:53,019 --> 00:42:55,690
security starts with a military and

977
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:57,400
science issue  There is one one can talk a lot

978
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,789
because Chile is the internet and the

979
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:02,549
computerized ones do not become widespread until the year

980
00:43:02,549 --> 00:43:07,029
90, that is, I was a girl I was

981
00:43:07,029 --> 00:43:09,519
just accompanying them so

982
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:11,949
there is a lot to say there is a lot to talk

983
00:43:11,949 --> 00:43:14,319
for example we know that online games

984
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:15,909


985
00:43:15,909 --> 00:43:17,679
I am sorry I know  They are all

986
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:20,140
super smoked but for example wow they have a

987
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:23,259
better chance of giving you a partner or

988
00:43:23,259 --> 00:43:26,019
having friends who are willing to

989
00:43:26,019 --> 00:43:28,209
travel more kilometers to go see  rte

990
00:43:28,209 --> 00:43:30,249
and take care of what a network can be

991
00:43:30,249 --> 00:43:33,999
as an appointment shopkeeper so there is much

992
00:43:33,999 --> 00:43:36,549
much to work and take out I

993
00:43:36,549 --> 00:43:38,199
would not dare to say specific in

994
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:40,059
cybersecurity beyond the

995
00:43:40,059 --> 00:43:42,729
human factor I am not so is or my

996
00:43:42,729 --> 00:43:45,130
specialty but not thinking about the

997
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:46,359
codes  What happens is that we also

998
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:49,419
like 8.8 have given a lot of strength or

999
00:43:49,419 --> 00:43:51,399
dedication in the focus of social engineering

1000
00:43:51,399 --> 00:43:52,730


1001
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:55,040
precisely because from there the

1002
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,600
security of leaving the computer

1003
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,070
in an area starts from how to use

1004
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:59,420
how language uses how it handles and get

1005
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,790
information through  different games is a topic

1006
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:03,410
that is relevant to us and

1007
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:05,810
precisely exasperating then from

1008
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,700
that point on from sociology from

1009
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,260
behavior the user for us

1010
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:10,640
is trying to understand how to see the other

1011
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,740
part of the work of the code

1012
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,620
of the double

1013
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,520
confirmations for example  when you have

1014
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,770
to validate some type of application that

1015
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:20,450
is being used in order to absorb it by

1016
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:23,810
sociology in general, good for those who  That they

1017
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:25,460
do not know I am like a data

1018
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,470
freak sociology before calling sociology

1019
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:30,080
at some point tried or was referred to

1020
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,780
as social engineering in its attempt to

1021
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:35,150
exact science that human behavior

1022
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:37,760
is not an exact science because it

1023
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,450
is very dynamic after that,

1024
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:43,460
people like  I and who works in sociology

1025
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:45,050
work a lot on the

1026
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:47,780
user experience that is how I make this more

1027
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:51,200
intuitive so that it has to be less

1028
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,420
repellent and at the same time more secure

1029
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:55,640
that it goes from where you click to where

1030
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,350
you are showing how it is to activate and

1031
00:44:57,350 --> 00:44:59,480
deactivating certain things

1032
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,550
the problem in general that I have seen

1033
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:02,840
because I am also a

1034
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,940
user experience teacher is, for example,

1035
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:07,250
people who do not activate double security

1036
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:11,180
is because it gives them money to have two steps

1037
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:14,830
that take a second or two

1038
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:17,780
more people in  an area of me I also

1039
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:20,000
want to be popular wants

1040
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,410
everyone to know that I am where I am that

1041
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:22,820
has to do with a status issue

1042
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,640
ends by putting more info  Sensitive confirmation

1043
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,250
which should be put,

1044
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:31,310
therefore there are many studies in this regard, it

1045
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:33,500
starts from there is a classic called

1046
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,720
internet galaxy on consumption and

1047
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:38,420
cybersecurity and hence a lot of

1048
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:41,810
studies because again reality

1049
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:44,690
is intermingling what we say

1050
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:47,960
analog and what we say.  virtual and that is what

1051
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,280
is happening to us and how we react with

1052
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,530
that I have a lot of questions from the

1053
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:54,410
chat with time, how to answer them, let's go

1054
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:55,610
now

1055
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:57,920
and he thinks that makes him think about the

1056
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,320
streamings that asmr asks

1057
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,299
marcelo navarrete they

1058
00:46:02,299 --> 00:46:05,689
are weird I like them  I consume

1059
00:46:05,689 --> 00:46:07,429
but I consume a super specific type

1060
00:46:07,429 --> 00:46:10,910
called hmr unintentional

1061
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:12,410
so people like here cook and you

1062
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:14,900
listen to how the office sounds, do not

1063
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,479
notice paint, yes but that as if they are

1064
00:46:17,479 --> 00:46:19,939
talking in my ear and you will hear well, eating

1065
00:46:19,939 --> 00:46:23,509
threshes me then it is the  complex

1066
00:46:23,509 --> 00:46:27,739
depends on the sensory sensitivity

1067
00:46:27,739 --> 00:46:30,090
that each person may have

1068
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:35,370
I would say that you think they make others see more

1069
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:37,320
these people write these  But

1070
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,430
those who are dedicated to taking exams

1071
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:40,050
make those who try to

1072
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:43,109
generate other types of content see more,

1073
00:46:43,109 --> 00:46:45,450
I have mixed feelings there

1074
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:49,499
because content is continuous, it

1075
00:46:49,499 --> 00:46:50,940
suddenly depends on which platform I want to expose it, I

1076
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:54,989
consider that many times there is

1077
00:46:54,989 --> 00:46:56,400
content because there is a

1078
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,650
previous demand  the content that one is

1079
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,150
creating and was not trying to take advantage of

1080
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:03,990
so I do not think it makes it look bad

1081
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:06,150
but you have to take it for what it is, that is,

1082
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:07,950
if you want to see news you are going to go to an

1083
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,869
une semaine channel that speaks news

1084
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:12,390
and makes video  I rehearse if you want to

1085
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:14,310
see someone cook under a channel that

1086
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:16,800
writes about cooking then I don't think

1087
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,440
there is a bigger problem about that

1088
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,230
unless and this is how very charry

1089
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:25,770
picking those channels of the cmr and it's like

1090
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:27,540
they whisper in your ear  that there could

1091
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:29,610
be a problem with who they are

1092
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:33,780
whispering as well as not voting for such

1093
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,630
a political party

1094
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:40,470
if minors are not legalized for xenophobia

1095
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:43,290
that kind of thing I think would

1096
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:46,380
be pro  The rest is like it's not

1097
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:49,050
my favorite content but I don't think

1098
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:51,660
it's problematic like the discussion

1099
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,490
that we could have about the consumption and

1100
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:55,680
creation of jatab content in

1101
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,019
tweets.

1102
00:47:57,019 --> 00:47:59,029


1103
00:47:59,029 --> 00:48:01,039


1104
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:03,339
example

1105
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:06,019
Facebook and tweets demands

1106
00:48:06,019 --> 00:48:07,489
regarding this type of content because they are

1107
00:48:07,489 --> 00:48:10,399
platforms that supposedly invite teenagers with

1108
00:48:10,399 --> 00:48:13,309
their parents' permissions and that they

1109
00:48:13,309 --> 00:48:15,169
will be exposed to content that can

1110
00:48:15,169 --> 00:48:18,859
be sexualized so there we have

1111
00:48:18,859 --> 00:48:21,229
another level of discussion that I think

1112
00:48:21,229 --> 00:48:23,749
maybe we should focus more than  It is with

1113
00:48:23,749 --> 00:48:26,689
respect as responsible adults that

1114
00:48:26,689 --> 00:48:28,640
we teach to filter the

1115
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,459
appropriate type of video game content or

1116
00:48:31,459 --> 00:48:34,370
streamer content to the minors given

1117
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:37,520
and in ait about the same, Don Agustín

1118
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,590
Jara says that he thinks about them

1119
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:41,450
being who are under 13

1120
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:45,440
years for example, here I am going to become

1121
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,590
like a super super intransigent adult

1122
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:50,720
again I insist  I work with the

1123
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,040
use of video games for

1124
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,750
education I work doing

1125
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:56,600
excel streamer of accera etc.

1126
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,450
minors and especially children under 3 years old

1127
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:03,830
should not generate content is highly

1128
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:06,320
dangerous you are exposing them to an

1129
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,630
emotional space to which they

1130
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:13,460
are not yet adapted with  a pressure of

1131
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:15,920
general content you are exposing it to the

1132
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,720
world and it is exposing it there are people

1133
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,630
who can become obsessed with it it is super

1134
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:22,430
strange the number of people who are

1135
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:24,770
obsessed with children or with the idea of

1136
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:27,610
children so I would say who writes

1137
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:29,490
I enjoy

1138
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:32,580
yes yes  And it's super weird because I was

1139
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:34,200
exposing him to fame, it's a bit what

1140
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,000
happens to children who are famous, such

1141
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,250
as singing or acting, is exactly

1142
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:40,790
the same and I understand that they join the chochera, I

1143
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:43,680
gave up and took care of all my nephews

1144
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,780
and it's like in  The chochera is like this the

1145
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,580
most intelligent child and look what you do and

1146
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,080
let's give it a chance because it could

1147
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,390
be I do not know for his future his profession I

1148
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:53,880
do not know what p  But maybe it is to expose them

1149
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:57,390
very early to something that may not be

1150
00:49:57,390 --> 00:50:00,360
the best way, I would hope that they have

1151
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,580
three where they are supposed to

1152
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:03,750
have formed criteria to continue

1153
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:07,110
accompanying them in the process now I

1154
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:10,050
am impressed that there is an Asian child

1155
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:12,150
on YouTube who  That was due once a

1156
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:14,220
week in an amount of money that

1157
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,530
I could imagine in my life because he

1158
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:18,060
is a child that you see him playing with

1159
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:20,100
toy toys, he likes it, he

1160
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,500
does not look for it, it is like through

1161
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:23,940
user experience of  Marketing is

1162
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:25,770
wonderful if you dedicate yourself to being a

1163
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:28,800
toy but outside of that, putting it

1164
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,810
publicly, I believe that it is a very

1165
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:33,270
risky space for children and that through

1166
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:34,530
ethics I must say

1167
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:36,210
there is a hiring issue because I do not know

1168
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:37,620
if you have a perception of the gestation of the

1169
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:40,650
child but a part like that money is really going

1170
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:43,900
to go directly to the child

1171
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:45,640
, we have already seen what has happened with the

1172
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:48,330
children of stars yes

1173
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:50,610
and in mine and what do you think about the streams

1174
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:52,380
or influences that it generates  n I hate

1175
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:54,960
through their streams,

1176
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,440
look, I insist that here there is an issue

1177
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:01,290
that we are still not clear about or we are not

1178
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:04,830
aware that it is virtual, it does not

1179
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:06,720
mean that it is unreal, I will

1180
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,720
repeat it as well as until I die

1181
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,190
then many people and it is  as there is but

1182
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:12,870
if I write nonsense and what does it matter,

1183
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:14,940
I get lost in the volume but there is a

1184
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:16,800
person who is working behind it and who

1185
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,620
has it and generated an impact therefore

1186
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:21,960
I think it is tremendously irresponsible to

1187
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:26,220
go around telling the fans what

1188
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:29,160
they harass another content generator the

1189
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:32,340
best and if for example you go you discover

1190
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:33,720
that there is a person who is generating

1191
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,850
content that has unethical behaviors

1192
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:37,800
that you do not like,

1193
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,240
you can make a call for example to

1194
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:42,810
be angry and do not consume it but not to

1195
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:46,800
send  hate that there are cases

1196
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,540
of content generators who have committed suicide because of the

1197
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:51,090
topic or fans who do not understand that

1198
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:53,310
one thing is not to give a dislike and another

1199
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:56,190
thing is to go and get themselves I do not know where they

1200
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:58,650
live what is their routine  Begin to call him on

1201
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:01,290
the cell phone and men

1202
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:03,030
have a specific man that type of

1203
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:05,360
practice

1204
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,560
has a name that particular practice has

1205
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,090
and is beginning to

1206
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:10,560
seek this being to typify some

1207
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:13,170
parts of the world made exact because

1208
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:14,910
again most of the

1209
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:17,160
content generators due to the rhythm that

1210
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,390
these platforms demand  If you want to

1211
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:20,940
monetize the exposure as much as possible, they tend to

1212
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:24,450
have mental health problems, anxiety

1213
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:26,840
and depression,

1214
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,970
which usually affect people's egos so much

1215
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:32,170
the current cybersecurity risks,

1216
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:35,200
I mean, this is an answer that is

1217
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,599
totally prejudiced because I am a

1218
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:39,549
sociologist.  Human

1219
00:52:39,549 --> 00:52:41,680
factor is the most important factor of which one

1220
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,809
messes up all the nonsense since

1221
00:52:43,809 --> 00:52:46,240
I did not understand I did not read no case could be

1222
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,299
in nor in like that in thick letters red

1223
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:52,930
above the same no and one is still without a cover his

1224
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:54,670
digital camera he forgot to turn off the

1225
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:56,440
microphone  the call remains

1226
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:00,040
on, it is like especially in such a fast rhythm

1227
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,770
of life, he takes the current one  it is

1228
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:04,930
much more likely to have errors that

1229
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:07,540
are of a human nature wants errors

1230
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:11,400
like this because it is wrongly programmed

1231
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:15,110
question from milan streamers are

1232
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:16,420
doing something for security

1233
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:18,680
cybersecurity someone is aware of

1234
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,900
this or gives some kind of

1235
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,490
digital hygiene advice during their

1236
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,170
broadcasts or let it be

1237
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:25,670
particularly  It is not in the

1238
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:29,330
current head of the elderly or of the streamers

1239
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:30,770
who have a greater capacity to reach a

1240
00:53:30,770 --> 00:53:32,570
larger audience,

1241
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:36,890
look at me to declare a little incompetent

1242
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:39,920
about the amount of estimating that I consume I

1243
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,050
do not consume I do

1244
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:43,460
not consume thematic as well as

1245
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:45,110
conventional programming or if the insurance

1246
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:47,030
Specifically, which does not mean that they

1247
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:49,040
do not exist, it means that I have not

1248
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,080
found it yet, surely there must be

1249
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,410
but it is not usually a

1250
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:56,240
constant concern of who is generating

1251
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:59,570
content and who makes it public in

1252
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,070
general instances like this that are

1253
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:05,060
talks, there are workshops, maximum one goes  and he

1254
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:08,120
finds them I do not know in these

1255
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,880
leather advertisements that sponsors them and that says com  or

1256
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,030
the security problems but there

1257
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:15,920
is not so much content that is not

1258
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,370
specialized that is, for example,

1259
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:21,440
let's sit down and talk about the five things

1260
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,330
that you do, for example, ranging from

1261
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:27,140
I don't know how to enter your bank and enter from

1262
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:29,570
google instead of specifically typing

1263
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:32,120
the dot  com that makes you fall

1264
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,830
on a phishing page instead of

1265
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:36,290
entering the page your bank

1266
00:54:36,290 --> 00:54:38,760
does not click on certain things that is

1267
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:41,700
like one would say that there is a bit of

1268
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:44,030
common sense but it is not common sense

1269
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:49,589
there is no common but as in  That detail

1270
00:54:49,589 --> 00:54:51,480
that you are tired that you are running is

1271
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,700
much easier to fall due to the human factor

1272
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:56,130
than to fall is how I did not realize that it

1273
00:54:56,130 --> 00:55:00,740
said dot with instead of dot with the

1274
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:02,670
query tomás pérez at what age do you

1275
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:06,319
recommend to start writing

1276
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:09,690
my recommendation to squeeze is being

1277
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:12,750
of legal age because one assumes that there is a

1278
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:15,120
criterion formed with respect to understanding

1279
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,370
certain risks and not giving information

1280
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:20,280
more than a fault now that is an

1281
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,590
ideal type because not all adults

1282
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:24,240
they have that and there are people who learn

1283
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,380
it earlier

1284
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:29,110
that is, it is more likely that you will save yourself the

1285
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:30,430
issue of without your

1286
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:31,930
school uniform appearing that they leave your

1287
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:35,920
school is how there is a control or a

1288
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,380
more likely abstraction of both

1289
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:40,870
There could be information and

1290
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:43,240
it is probably more difficult to fall into

1291
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:46,290
categories of difficult grooming

1292
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:49,340


1293
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:53,930
the number of actors that open up are

1294
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:57,019
impressive alondra

1295
00:55:57,019 --> 00:55:59,149
peñalillo asks what he recommends

1296
00:55:59,149 --> 00:56:00,769
to parents who pass their cell phones to

1297
00:56:00,769 --> 00:56:03,339
their young children,

1298
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:07,220
the ideal is that they are in the same

1299
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:09,890
room that the child when the child

1300
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:12,619
is consuming something from the internet

1301
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,720
either YouTube social networks and two

1302
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,300
games etc. and that accompany the

1303
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,700
experience and I speak in general

1304
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:22,580
with respect to video games and it is like not

1305
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:25,460
every social network or all content is for

1306
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:27,980
everything  viewer and usually have these

1307
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:30,320
as it is for teenagers it is for mature people

1308
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:33,320
etc. and have a relationship in which

1309
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:36,020
one as a responsible adult can

1310
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:39,650
guide and  n the minor experience under

1311
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:40,970
consideration, which is, for example, there are

1312
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:43,100
people who lie, not all people lie,

1313
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,090
but it is likely that you can

1314
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:46,369
meet someone who lies, this game is

1315
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:48,380
showing violence, the violence is not

1316
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:50,119
correct, but in this context it is

1317
00:56:50,119 --> 00:56:52,130
understood that it is fantasy, not  It is going

1318
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:54,080
wrong but that does not mean that you go and you

1319
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:56,500
can hit your friend's

1320
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:59,730
eye It does not correspond I do not know what you

1321
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:03,880
are more there are influencers gamer girls it already sounds

1322
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,860
attractive and suddenly one of the things

1323
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:09,580
that happens is that minors arrive and

1324
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:11,530
they themselves  They take photos with

1325
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:14,470
bare chest posing which as well as I am

1326
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:16,750
seductive and one as well as no no no this

1327
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:18,220
child just sent me child pornography

1328
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:20,470
that I do unless the penalties

1329
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:22,099
of hell

1330
00:57:22,099 --> 00:57:24,799
as that I should not do there is

1331
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:26,239
a part in fact he wants  that

1332
00:57:26,239 --> 00:57:28,489
we all grew up boys and others like you

1333
00:57:28,489 --> 00:57:31,009
are exposing yourself for free west it

1334
00:57:31,009 --> 00:57:32,989
seems that this person who says he is

1335
00:57:32,989 --> 00:57:34,549
a child is not a child or does not have the

1336
00:57:34,549 --> 00:57:36,339
best intentions

1337
00:57:36,339 --> 00:57:40,509
forgiveness and dew I know that if we work

1338
00:57:40,509 --> 00:57:43,239
together in demented radio we have a certain

1339
00:57:43,239 --> 00:57:45,609
confidence I want dear look just

1340
00:57:45,609 --> 00:57:47,380
open a question quickly davis

1341
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,180
grandson in long fans which is the same as

1342
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:51,219
asking those of peña and lillo who what do

1343
00:57:51,219 --> 00:57:52,749
you think what is your opinion and  What do

1344
00:57:52,749 --> 00:57:54,130
you think could happen in the future with

1345
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:57,219
this platform? He had announced that this

1346
00:57:57,219 --> 00:57:58,809
way that he was going to move away from the

1347
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:01,329
pornographic part did not happen to me is that he

1348
00:58:01,329 --> 00:58:03,309
and fans part as an

1349
00:58:03,309 --> 00:58:06,579
alternative platform to what is the pattern, that

1350
00:58:06,579 --> 00:58:07,239
is why the subject is a fan

1351
00:58:07,239 --> 00:58:10,599
is that due to many

1352
00:58:10,599 --> 00:58:13,059
many problems that I have had with the

1353
00:58:13,059 --> 00:58:15,900
content that is for adults that is not

1354
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:19,450
industrialized, it has become very difficult

1355
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:22,720
and it was easier to change the fans due to the

1356
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,670
way in which to generate content and

1357
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:26,500
monetize

1358
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:29,250
especially in adult material

1359
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:32,260
then it was  made this migration and

1360
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:34,180
the platform is very famous but you

1361
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:36,460
could have some fans of your singing

1362
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:38,380
to monetize the same way they

1363
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:40,420
have a pattern a coffee vanilla

1364
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:42,310
cof  fee or any of these other

1365
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,600
applications of

1366
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,090
monetization platforms through donations if

1367
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:47,830
the interesting thing is that there is a

1368
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:50,620
rise in this content, particularly in

1369
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:54,550
young people and adults during the pandemic,

1370
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:56,140
which was a way in which they

1371
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:59,170
acquired these funds, however.  or

1372
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:00,910
financing, which was very well

1373
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:02,170
supported by the media,

1374
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:03,820
I must say that they even have the

1375
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:06,460
covers of the newspaper announcing that it was

1376
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,710
the business or salvation or what star

1377
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:11,170
or what internet icon he was dedicating to

1378
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:13,150
also making his own read fans already

1379
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:15,400
here  I have a dichotomy that is super

1380
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:20,800
complex because on the one hand an

1381
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,020
adult woman an adult man who wants to

1382
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:25,570
monetize his sexuality with certain

1383
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:27,970
characteristics of care being

1384
00:59:27,970 --> 00:59:29,410
of

1385
00:59:29,410 --> 00:59:31,690
legal age I can say that I am in favor or I

1386
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:34,420
will not judge it, it would not be my choice

1387
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:36,250
but I am not going to get like that and you are going

1388
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:39,730
to go to hell but my training as

1389
00:59:39,730 --> 00:59:41,470
sociologists shows me that women

1390
00:59:41,470 --> 00:59:43,510
and especially certain  Young people are much

1391
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:45,490
more vulnerable to issues of poverty and

1392
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:47,290
economic vulnerability than any other

1393
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:49,390
type of vulnerability and will offer this

1394
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:51,970
type of outlets as easy money is very

1395
00:59:51,970 --> 00:59:53,920
tempting.The problem is that as a

1396
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,380
society we are still very prejudiced

1397
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:59,050
and any work that you have

1398
00:59:59,050 --> 01:00:00,520
later if  Someone knew that you

1399
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,380
had a law fans died and

1400
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:03,970
left you stuck in the industry of

1401
01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:06,040
sexual or adult content or

1402
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:08,550
sex workers when many people

1403
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:11,380
in a pandemic space losing their

1404
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:13,960
jobs trying a monetization

1405
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:16,360
saw it as a lifesaver later

1406
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:19,030
could be  a lead lifesaver

1407
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:20,250
which generates

1408
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:23,830
my concern about it as well as it is

1409
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:26,620
between what it should be and what it is with

1410
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:29,110
respect to the risk in addition to the safety

1411
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:30,670
of the material and content that is uploaded

1412
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:33,640
then the exact one is filtered can go to

1413
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:34,990
different pages can be dealt with in

1414
01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:35,740
pages

1415
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:37,830
that are not necessarily very

1416
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:40,780
reputable on this page where they can

1417
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:43,900
quote from that content  Also exact nest and

1418
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:47,470
harassment or even users who pay for

1419
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:49,900
the content harassing whoever generates the

1420
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:52,119
content that is like I don't know crazy I only

1421
01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:55,180
sell photos in bikini and I don't do that

1422
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:56,320
kind of thing with which you are

1423
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,920
asking me and that they insist and be  It gives harassment

1424
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:01,000
after that

1425
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,619
I believe and that I think it is the most

1426
01:01:02,619 --> 01:01:07,330
problematic that there is tick tock that

1427
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,160
there are tweets that there is facebook that

1428
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,380
there is instagram put you on the social network

1429
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:13,570
that there is has a high content of

1430
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:15,940
young people that it is normal

1431
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:19,000
about  Everything given that on 87 200

1432
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,160
Chileans have two cell phones or

1433
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:22,390
access to the internet is through

1434
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:24,220
cell phones,

1435
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:27,280
find a girl who is attractive and they

1436
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,099
start the whole process of waiting for

1437
01:01:30,099 --> 01:01:33,250
it to be legal, then there is a but if

1438
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:35,890
the phony is that attractive of  Suddenly

1439
01:01:35,890 --> 01:01:37,599
I could pay you to college with some

1440
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:40,630
fans or you could buy it is almost like the

1441
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:44,609
theme of no one wanted to play

1442
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:49,300
citation of girls who are minors so

1443
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:51,310
that the act when the content exists is

1444
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:53,230
no longer a topic  of grooming because it

1445
01:01:53,230 --> 01:01:55,930
is already illegal but it is to incite since they are

1446
01:01:55,930 --> 01:01:58,030
minors or even to me it has come to me to

1447
01:01:58,030 --> 01:02:00,040
have as I did not want to open a

1448
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:01,660
hole that would pay up to 50 dollars

1449
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:03,400
as

1450
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:06,150
