like us, is women on it, is to

27
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,899
share knowledge, generate spaces

28
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:12,370
for interaction to reduce the

29
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,700
gender gap and help more women

30
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,540
enter  In the world of

31

cybersecurity, she is passionate about what she does,

32
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,460
that is why she is also here and also

internet connection problems but well hoping

45
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,519

00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,790
come to share the day is useful  Well today

49
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,849
I will proceed then to

50
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:07,049
share my screen

51
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,560
and please confirm when you

52
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,310
can see it

53
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,690
I will minimize here

54
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,120
I see it perfect from my perfect screen

55
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,120


56
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:32,439
ok because today I want to give I think

57
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:35,290
it is not a new topic for many but

58
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,180
It is a subject that sometimes, due to the same

59
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:37,989
common

60
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:40,569
daily life, what we do and how we do it,

61
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:43,389
we let pass some tips that

62
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,849
can help us  ar to give value to what we

63
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:48,569
are doing and today I come to speak

64
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:52,150
specifically about what a

65
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,639
true vulnerability analysis should look

66
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:56,200
like and how it is the result of the

67
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,790
vulnerabilities that we are

68
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,230
finding in the

69
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,069
information systems that we are auditing that

70
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:05,889
can really be used to identify

71
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:08,230
the level of risk to which

72
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,139
the target that we are auditing is exposed behind

73
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:13,449
the target, since there will be a

74
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:17,228
private public entity, a sector, etc.

75
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:19,149
where we can show the true value

76
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:21,459
of what we are doing then,

77
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,039
that is why I have called it that way from the technical to the

78
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:27,150
tactical  because we cannot pretend

79
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,580
and turn this vulnerability analysis process

80
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,330
into a fat button issue

81
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,610
where we are simply going to be

82
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,100
at a scan, we print a result and

83
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,139
present that client scanner

84
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,930
this is also not only from the point

85
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:47,360
of view of us as open testers

86
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,229
I hear soon security analysts that we

87
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:52,879
are dedicated to doing this but also

88
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:55,340
of  From the client's perspective, how

89
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,020
is he receiving these results,

90
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,860
then here is a brief

91
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,770
introduction of

92
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,710
who we are I always represent my

93
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,969
community that I carry them in my blood

94
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,900
I come leave clubbers can is a

95
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,910
community of girls who intend to

96
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:21,200
do the same as what  The same that today

97
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,140
joined us here and let's say we become the

98
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,940
same feeling and it is to share the

99
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,980
knowledge I am a telecommunications engineer,

100
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,630
a cybersecurity consultant,

101
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,060
I have different

102
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,380
certifications, including I need it, the

103
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:41,000
lead auditor, 27,000, etc. Yes,

104
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
if you have any questions, you can

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,160
contact me through me  twitter ok

106
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:55,289
good let's go into the matter a bit

107
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:57,629
here of course I also make an

108
00:05:57,629 --> 00:05:59,460
advertisement that is not paid politics

109
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:03,330
simply so that our

110
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,399
community also recognizes that we are almost

111
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,550
sister communities with all

112
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,619
those who are doing and working to

113
00:06:10,619 --> 00:06:12,589
promote the participation of women

114
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:16,229
in these branches of knowledge they

115
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:19,710
do  e that we can reduce that gap in

116
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,240
women's participation so we

117
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,960
are all brother communities

118
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,470
and today we will really see what

119
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,690
blood in brings them to because blood in

120
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:34,080
because in blood in vulnerability

121
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,490
analysis activities are considered

122
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,680
some tools

123
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,699
that we can start to  use if even

124
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:43,660


125
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,850
suddenly those who are listening to us

126
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,740
do not know how to start doing a

127
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,170
vulnerability analysis or want to

128
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:53,410
rahm while they serve to start I insist

129
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,640
that this

130
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,740
is this this presentation that I

131
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,950
bring you today is also very focused on the

132
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,140
value that we are giving it  to these

133
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,120
vulnerability analyzes when,

134
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,920
above all, we present them to the client, not

135
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,650
only we, as 2060, are going in front of

136
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,180
a camera, but also that we are

137
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,980
generating

138
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,810
the life cycle of vulnerability analysis,

139
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,110


140
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,510
evaluation, remediation, etc. as value in the market, some

141
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:23,570
indicators that from the perspective of

142
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,000
the organization can propose if

143
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,060
we are or are  s working with a

144
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,920
company where we were hired to

145
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,200
do security evaluations or

146
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,440
we have certain or certain

147
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,310
services in charge and we need to identify what

148
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,530
is the real level of risk that

149
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,960
these applications have and are

150
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,330
exposed or not exposed on the internet or if

151
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,660
they are simply within  a

152
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,690
network segment or an internal villain or within

153
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,360
a plateau or etcetera times what

154
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,360
would be not times I do not want to share

155
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,810
a series of concerns that in the end

156
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:04,520
help us to reflect if

157
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,320
what we are generating today as

158
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,110
vulnerability analysis is really useful or not

159
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,210
It works or if only with a

160
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:14,540
vulnerability analysis we can determine the

161
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,570
risk level of a computer system, it

162
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,670


163
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:22,450
is

164
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,160
good and here I want to start also

165
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,670


166
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,600
it is not paid political advertising

167
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,950
but I highly recommend this

168
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,460


169
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,880
twitter account where you can find very good

170
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,130
information about

171
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:49,730
tutorial tools  attacks or

172
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,820
protective measures from gluten

173
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,770
and that  can be implemented and that

174
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,690
we can test of course and that

175
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,530
we can prepare our laboratories

176
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,120
to put into practice what we are

177
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,100
learning when we face a

178
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,990
real scenario where we have to

179
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,970
apply it, it is worth it

180
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,990
then they are the ones that normally

181
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:16,139
identify or must deal with when we are

182
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,930
talking about the  blood and of course

183
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,180
this is already the blood in and the retina and what

184
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,000
it has is a subject that has already been

185
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,649
very controversial that many of

186
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,480
us already know but suddenly for those who do not

187
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,680
know

188
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,620
here it is simply worth

189
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,640
clarifying how from the

190
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,200
Security controls from

191
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,870
defensive protection measures we can begin to

192
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:44,080
articulate different strategies that

193
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,720
allow us to safeguard, let's say, the

194
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,380
information against those who want to

195
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,779
obtain a value, steal it or simply

196
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:58,510
circumvent the information systems that

197
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,010
we have implemented then there

198
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,709
are the sysadmin network administrators

199
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:04,300


200
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,610
the infrastructure managers

201
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,080
of the  s databases

202
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,700
etc. that are playing a very

203
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,020
important role that is sometimes very

204
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,930
unknown one says know and the

205
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:17,470
people behind the blue team are weak they do not

206
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:20,620
know they have a false sense of

207
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,490
security but sometimes you also have to

208
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:28,230
reflect on what can  That those

209
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,340
efforts that these

210
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,830
people are making are those that they know are not

211
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,410
within reach, then what is done if in

212
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,490
Brooklyn

213
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:38,380
the security fundamentals of

214
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,840
identifying, let's say what

215
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,300
those security gaps that we have

216
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,920
currently configured in our

217
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,030
information systems are,

218
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,210
what are the  Measures to detect

219
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,890
abnormal behaviors that are

220
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,440
happening through our network is an

221
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,090
infrastructure that is

222
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,490
not visible to us so

223
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,460
we have to find a way to

224
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,440
make them visible

225
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,340
in time and place even if it is no longer as

226
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,400
if you are well in front of it.  of the computer or

227
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,960
as a pin tester, well here we are

228
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,710
playing systems of course all  It

229
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,570
touches sides, there is an activity

230
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:20,630
regarding that intelligence of threats, such

231
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,460
as detecting them, and identifying

232
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:26,180
god patterns that allow and model

233
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,700
a better security posture, because I know

234
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,320
that there is how it works and how

235
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,250
its operation could be altered,

236
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,210
here we find all those capabilities

237
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,520
also of

238
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,970
forensic efforts.  As soon as

239
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,520
an unexpected event occurs, an incident,

240
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,760
an insider is trying or managed to

241
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,460
infiltrate information, so those of us who

242
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,160
blood in also have the capabilities of

243
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,460
this type of tool, processes

244
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,490
to investigate it, to be at least the

245
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,230
first responders capable of

246
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,540
stopping the impact that it may be

247
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:09,380
generating or  that could have generated a

248
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,900
security incident due to a security breach

249
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,960


250
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:20,840
tools such as 100 100 now what we

251
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,320
call orchestrators that allow us to

252
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,760
correlate all those

253
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,750
security elements that cannot, let's say, be

254
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,180
joined by their system due to their

255
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,100
operation then there appears the

256
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,500
famous solar that inte  gra all these

257
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,060
security controls that today are

258
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,829
being implemented live the trend,

259
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,760
let's say of protection,

260
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,430
that according to gartner and different

261
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,980
specialists because they are bringing manufacturers to the

262
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,050
market, etc.,

263
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,010
we fall short in implementing systems

264
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,690
with a single purpose and now we

265
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,400
need to have

266
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,690
complete visibility  of everything that we are

267
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:03,210
implementing then it is not only to see the

268
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:08,190
100 or the vice or the ips or the pop or well

269
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,110
all these security solutions that

270
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,240
are from the blue team we are managing and

271
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,430
that each one is going its way fulfilling

272
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:19,050
its purpose but now we have  The

273
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,300
challenge is to live all that intelligence that

274
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,410
is being generated then the

275
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,860
knowledge so that it allows us to go on,

276
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,820
let's say,

277
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,930
hunting or identifying which

278
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,480
threats that may arise and of

279
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,050
course everything concerning 15 in

280
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:39,640
response and those capacities to detect

281
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,450
in time in time space in  a place

282
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:47,060
that is happening in my

283
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,589
information systems and how can I enter

284
00:13:48,589 --> 00:13:50,000
ar  sponder or if my own tools

285
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,459
have the capacity to respond

286
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,960
and here nothing else that this session brings us

287
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,420
complements

288
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,150
both for the pen tester and for the

289
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,400
company entity to which we are

290
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,230
making a bridge is a

291
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:11,080
security analysis that many times we even

292
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,660
criticize  We ourselves in like

293
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,050
other parties but other analysts do

294
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,300
or implement a

295
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,580
vulnerability analysis and suddenly they sell it

296
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,680
to the client as they made tremendous

297
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,640
bridges and in reality it was not like that it also

298
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,310
serves so that people made them

299
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,620
the security administrators all of a

300
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,440
sudden  They do not have the technical knowledge

301
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,150
because they can understand how we must

302
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,830
identify so that they are not getting

303
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:45,460
their hands on the opa or when a

304
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,580
vulnerability analysis can really

305
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,150
provide value of course, it could provide

306
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,860
threats, malware analysis and well

307
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,240
now the advanced symptoms that are

308
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,880
integrated with the  with the orchestrated

309
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,760
so that is like the context in

310
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,610
which today we are  Basing this

311
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,310
presentation

312
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,320
and if you have any concerns of

313
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,230
course because through the

314
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,230
established means of course you can do it there

315
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,460
will be things that I do not know I could not

316
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,620
answer during the session but

317
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,050
through me from my twitter I could

318
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,120
respond

319
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,029
vulnerability analysis then it is

320
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:25,740
important to understand that  it is a

321
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,020
true vulnerability analysis that understands

322
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:31,920
how it can be differentiated between a test or

323
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,690
another type of analysis that seeks to

324
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,640
identify security gaps in

325
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,830
information systems each

326
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,540
vulnerability analysis has a focus a

327
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,690
purpose it is already

328
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:46,500
we do not know if it searches showed it will go you know

329
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,270
about  A tool that helps me

330
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:51,180
analyze the weaknesses of a firewall

331
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,980
to see that there are no fat button tools

332
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,420
that you run with one click and it

333
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,370
ends and there is already a

334
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,260
vulnerability analysis let's say that things do not

335
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:02,630
work that way then here

336
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,120
to clarify and for what  all handle the

337
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,280
same the same definition the

338
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,530
vulnerability scan involves  creates an

339
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:11,850
automated tool that allows you to

340
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,410
discover holes and

341
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,960
defense skills and exposures present in

342
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,270
information systems these tests

343
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,460
are white box because they are white box

344
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,280
because the person or entity or

345
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,720
who we are doing it if we are

346
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,850
doing it to a prior

347
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:32,390
written authorization and  Once the owner is formalized,

348
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,070
let's say the analysis knows that

349
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,500
the people of the blue team are doing them, they

350
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,090
also know if we do not

351
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,850
already belong to that team and then they

352
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:44,310
will already have some measures prepared in

353
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,530
case something goes wrong always when

354
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,870
we even launch these scanners they

355
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:52,260
can happen  things where

356
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,000
multiple requests can knock down

357
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,330
services if we don't know how to configure it

358
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,190
then let's call this a

359
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:02,270
white box approach

360
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,069
and they differ from many others it is

361
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,810
true because when one talks

362
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,960
about vulnerability analysis I insist

363
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,240
people sell it as open test or as

364
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,190
tests of ethical gardening and this is not the case,

365
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,410
these tests differ  ian

366
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,960
of vulnerability scans because they are

367
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,790
automated, these scans are

368
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,650
generally configured through

369
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:25,020
a tool and there are a series of steps

370
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,200
not to identify an objective that

371
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,060
should soon be well known to identify the

372
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,490
objective is to collect the greatest amount

373
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,830
of information about the workshop by  which

374
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,330
I am going to do a vulnerability analysis

375
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,980


376
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,549
and launch the tools that

377
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:44,679
are generally automated already have

378
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:47,980
some patterns, some signatures where these

379
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:52,690
engines analyze whether or not it meets the

380
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,500
criteria of a vulnerability,

381
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,260
these take minutes unlike

382
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,260
other bridges or other exercises that  They

383
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,020
come to me to measure the risk because the

384
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,810
others may take days because hours, days,

385
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,000
weeks depending on the complexity and

386
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,700
the type of black fishing, gray box,

387
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,490
etc.,

388
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,620
are scheduled schedules as

389
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,590
I had previously indicated, they are

390
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:22,100
passive here, we do not seek to

391
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,110
break my

392
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:28,130
or exploit any vulnerability

393
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,540
we simply confirm them in mu  cha

394
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,700
education are not confirmed,

395
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,830
false positives can simply appear there,

396
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,410
which is the following,

397
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,090
many false positives are reported because the

398
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:41,790
scanner equaled certain criteria and if they

399
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:44,090
are, they may be possible when even

400
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:47,400
rice the results of this scan are thrown,

401
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,490
there relation to what is

402
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:56,130
certainly or  it may be very likely that

403
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,580
this vulnerability is happening or not

404
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,130
what happens here also with

405
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:05,460
vulnerability scans the

406
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,710
same scan you run for a

407
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,460


408
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,740
target based on the patterns already

409
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,840
defined by the engine can appear in a

410
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,990
target bet then already

411
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,300


412
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,570
These results are already configured, these results are previously configured and as they

413
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,490
will be identical in the case in which

414
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,230
of course it has the same

415
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,450
security gaps but it will not have any

416
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:30,630
differential, it is valid and the last thing because more

417
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:34,140
exploitation is what really differs

418
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:38,640
from ours and  of other tests of well

419
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,440
let's say of security

420
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,830
here you can know that it is not tried

421
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,320
identify if there are

422
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,720
zero-day vulnerabilities or security gaps that

423
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,430
have not been previously identified

424
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,820
because there would be no way to check them and

425
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:58,160
generally well, here in the management

426
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,590
we are going to see

427
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,419
a process that I do not want to

428
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:04,860
mention here at the moment

429
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,679
now I want to talk a little  more of what

430
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,330
are the annals what are the types

431
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,610
of vulnerability analysis and

432
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:15,090
internal external vulnerability

433
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,650
analysis of vulnerability analysis that are

434
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,200
done to wi-fi networks or simply

435
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,200
focused on the purpose of the target that I

436
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,299
am effects that can be based on

437
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:26,060
applications

438
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:29,690
based  these network

439
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:32,120
devices in communication devices depends

440
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,130
on the focus that we want to give it, of course,

441
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,870
there are tools

442
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:38,720
in all of them, there is always a pattern, which is the

443
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,000
one I just told you, collect all the

444
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,070
information about the network through

445
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:46,570
different tools

446
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:49,400
identifying security gaps  here

447
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,840
generally manual tests are not done

448
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:55,100
or let's say it is

449
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,530
the most common  The only thing is that manual tests are not done here

450
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:00,410
but I come to

451
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:03,890
tell you that later in other light

452
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:06,470
we cannot keep these

453
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,059
analyzes or those reports that

454
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:09,710
Espanyol is generating lists because they can be

455
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:12,590
false positives so you can put

456
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,150
another person here who  run a

457
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,970
program it would not make any difference if

458
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:19,669
I as responsible for security or

459
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:22,280
account esther or security analyst

460
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,870
because I am in front of truth you have to

461
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:27,140
put that color and that flavor of

462
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,270
hear that in front there is a person who is

463
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:33,080
at least saying yes  This can

464
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,980
be verified by means of a possible

465
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,280
exploitation or not,

466
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,680
then basically if we are

467
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,840
dragging or doing a

468
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,370
vulnerability analysis from an

469
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,740
external environment where we do not have access to the

470
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,590
internal network, then if we do a,

471
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,320
let's say a previous analysis and look for

472
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,450
information through  of tools that

473
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:57,670
allow us to identify which are the

474
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:01,210
ips ranges, which are the

475
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,510
emails that are being  They are managing the

476
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:07,140
mail server etc. to identify

477
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:10,030
weaknesses in the web servers if they

478
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:12,660
exist and that they are exposed to the internet,

479
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,370
one could do a type of

480
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:17,730
vulnerability analysis and external

481
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:20,970
of course here without breaking or penetrating

482
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,520
any type of system information

483
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,290
the vulnerability analysis is coming

484
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:28,250
internal where I as a responsible

485
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:32,570
open tester or security analyst

486
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:36,080
must do in my schedule

487
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,700
of vulnerability analysis if the

488
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:41,179
entity has it then it makes a

489
00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:43,070
discovery mapping to identify the list

490
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,779
of new assets here it is very common to

491
00:22:44,779 --> 00:22:47,509
identify that people or  The companies

492
00:22:47,509 --> 00:22:50,149
the entities have no idea what

493
00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:52,580
they have connected to the network and not that it

494
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,380
is necessarily published but that it

495
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,289
is within their internal network within

496
00:22:57,289 --> 00:22:59,620
their vilán that are controlled by

497
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,870
operations by arias, well the

498
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,629
hierarchical structure that they have to

499
00:23:04,629 --> 00:23:07,580
decide and  turns out they find

500
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:11,120
test servers that

501
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,480
someone created years ago to  try a

502
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,580
specific field and left it there forgotten and that

503
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,279
machine already continues to generate

504
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:21,889
internet energy costs and so on and is already

505
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:25,850
forgotten without being suddenly updating the

506
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:29,240
device database.

507
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,179


508
00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:33,620


509
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,840


510
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,840
internal so here basically

511
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,980
different tools are used like

512
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,910
what do I know

513
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:47,090
on the map to discover which are the

514
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,460
servers, equipment, devices that

515
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,900
are giving a live and what are they

516
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,750
saying here hey here I am I look and

517
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,030
I send you a package so you know that

518
00:23:56,030 --> 00:24:00,050
here I am  that are listening and

519
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,910
well it also serves to identify

520
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,070
which are those network segments that

521
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,600
are over there forgotten in the

522
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,260
firewall where one goes and looks and they have 55,520

523
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,809
rules in the fa in the firewall and how

524
00:24:11,809 --> 00:24:13,730
there have been administrators at different

525
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:17,120
times and  at different times in the

526
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,890
life of the firewall then there are rules

527
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,320
that are not touched simply because it is not

528
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,270
known if they work  They ion or not and in case we

529
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:25,790
turn off the policy in the firewall

530
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:28,910
because today the operation of x service can fall

531
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:31,160
so what works well

532
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,760
is let's leave it critical, true that tends to

533
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,670
happen then for that

534
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:40,230
those types

535
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,610
of security vulnerabilities also serve for  measure

536
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:45,580
the state and the state the level of risk

537
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:48,460
of our wi-fi networks there are tools

538
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:52,210
too and there are analyzes, let's say manual,

539
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:55,450
that can be carried out sometimes the

540
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,370
proxy filters do not work sometimes

541
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,710
there are security gaps in those

542
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:03,010
access control lists sometimes  There are no

543
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:06,460
controls over the ips that connect

544
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,620
to the wi-fi networks and from there one

545
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,049
begins to run an analysis of the

546
00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:13,870
security gaps that it has

547
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:16,000
without exploiting them because that is the

548
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,730
objective of this exercise, however,

549
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:21,220
sometimes one  It is raised whether or not

550
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,870
a vulnerability is really exploited, but

551
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:26,590
it is really worth hiring a

552
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,539
vulnerability analysis service

553
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:31,179
without there being an exploitation or without

554
00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:34,570
There is a vector of compromise where I

555
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:37,000
can identify how a person an

556
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,980
attacker can break my information systems, they

557
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,200
would meet all the

558
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,919
objectives or not

559
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:47,799
and finally, they are

560
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:49,419
vulnerability analyzes based on

561
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:51,580
applications that these are the most

562
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,130
common, not many times they are  They hire

563
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:57,130
specific services to hear

564
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:59,710
this is my transactional portal, look to

565
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:02,020
see what it finds and then it

566
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:05,590
becomes that I am partializing

567
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,990
the security levels for each of

568
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,280
the assets that I have in the

569
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,320
organization and the pen tester

570
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,510
is also having a view  closed

571
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:17,530
and very limited if you are suddenly

572
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,809
evaluating the level of risk per

573
00:26:19,809 --> 00:26:21,809
application and not in a holistic sense,

574
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:24,039


575
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:26,109
then here we have different

576
00:26:26,109 --> 00:26:29,330
tools that right now we are going to see them

577
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:31,820
there one can identify

578
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,830
outdated services two libraries in the

579
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:37,070
software that are being made that

580
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,080
are using and are published

581
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,110
as information disclosur  e as

582
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:44,750
the was top 10 tells you where it says hey you

583
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:49,610
do not reveal you do not reveal the versions

584
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,430
of the packages or the

585
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,630
information systems that you are including

586
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,760
among your applications

587
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,120
avoid publishing them because today

588
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,160
there may not be, it may not be a

589
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,050
vulnerability  to liquefy and not because I have

590
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:05,350
the latest version as of today

591
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:08,500
July 8 but tomorrow the 9th can leave a

592
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,010
greeting and if I already know that I have 3.0 and right

593
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:13,720
now it is stable

594
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,640
and right now we are in 4 and a

595
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,430
vulnerability appears

596
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:20,400
in the last action then what is going on  to pass

597
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,040
then that

598
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,190
vulnerability analysis also works around

599
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:28,500
the time and moment in which

600
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,119
the

601
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:32,759
good analysis is done and of course that in the top 10

602
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:34,859
also gives us a tulle of

603
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:37,849
tools to do

604
00:27:38,169 --> 00:27:40,419
vulnerability analysis because

605
00:27:40,419 --> 00:27:43,840
we have already come a bit  Which ones there may be

606
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,350
n there are a thousand there are 25,000 there are

607
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:50,889
also tools that one creates and there are scripts that

608
00:27:50,889 --> 00:27:53,200
one automates so that this can be

609
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,730
done in the shortest time that is given by the

610
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,980
experience  ncia knowledge in

611
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,139
programming and others, but these are the

612
00:27:59,139 --> 00:28:01,779
basics, each one will obviously have their

613
00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:04,509
favorites and will not like any of

614
00:28:04,509 --> 00:28:07,480
those mentioned here, it is valid, this

615
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,869
is a let's say a basic level for a

616
00:28:10,869 --> 00:28:13,269
person who today does not know how to start,

617
00:28:13,269 --> 00:28:16,179
so come on.  look here go to google in

618
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:18,220
google and tell me these are the

619
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,409
tools that there may be more there

620
00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:22,809
may be less start with these if

621
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:25,419
you don't know or if you already have a

622
00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:27,850
slightly higher level it also works

623
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:32,179
always true for all scans

624
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:36,549
let's say to identify host

625
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:40,190
identify services identify a

626
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:43,070
vulnerability for example with meta

627
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:47,090
exploit sorry you cannot identify if

628
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:49,130
this exploit is susceptible to being

629
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:51,380
exploited through a

630
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:54,080
specific hair that is already uploaded in

631
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,560
the msf database correct

632
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,720
n more because it is the tool is  Like the

633
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,730
keychain that one has as a

634
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:05,470
security analyst in his pocket, he should not

635
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:07,540
leave it at all because it is a

636
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:10,180
tool that is very  lti generational and it

637
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,770
serves at any time for

638
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:14,560
any recognition in the mab is

639
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,780
very important and also because it has its

640
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:20,710
own scripts since they evaluate

641
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:24,700
security levels etc. open bass in

642
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,110
packaging is an

643
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:29,170
open source tool that your linux if suddenly

644
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:31,810
have a  Laboratory with which they do

645
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:33,730
vulnerability analysis here already

646
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,010
from the point of view of who executes

647
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:37,780
the pen test of course we are

648
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,790
having different views so I do not

649
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:42,400
get lost in the view from the business and

650
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,930
the view from the bridge is who

651
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:46,550
executes those analyzes

652
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,590
So when you are the one who is going to

653
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:52,100
do that exercise then here you will

654
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,620
find these tools and then

655
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,200
open bases is an

656
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,150
open source tool where you can launch is a

657
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:02,480
vulnerability scanner like nexus

658
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,270
like hacu net is like open bar like

659
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,270
themes like which etc. in  where as

660
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:11,140
others are paid here another thing is that

661
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,970
those those engines when they are licensed

662
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:16,520
get to be very c  expensive and in some

663
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,340
cases the value increases depending on

664
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,010
the number of targets or the

665
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:23,750
frequency with which you are going to run

666
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:26,690
these tests, then when there is

667
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:28,640
money and it can be invested there is no

668
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,140
problem, the problem even

669
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:37,070
when organizations do not have a budget

670
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,630
to  to buy the tool then

671
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:41,330
you have to go to a staggered company or to the

672
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:42,940
mitation we think that they allow one to

673
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:46,000
do this type of analysis

674
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,670
we have on the other hand nets songs you

675
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:50,440


676
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,870
in scripts that help you to

677
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:54,900
identify

678
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,100
weaknesses and which is that it is also

679
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:01,720
a  The topic is a paid engine but here it is

680
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,760
important if you have

681
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,010
institutional emails from your

682
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:09,980
universities because you can acquire that

683
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:13,560
community version and you can have access

684
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,020
to the

685
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,850
vulnerability analysis engine which works very

686
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:20,010
well allows you to scan at least one

687
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:22,340
target

688
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,710
of an application.

689
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:27,110
vulnerability analysis to an application or

690
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:29,870
installed on the virtual beach to

691
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:33,049
make different  rents analyzes of up to 16

692
00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:35,570
I think they can keep there it works

693
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:37,520
for a year then so it is

694
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,299
quite good yes yes we are learning

695
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:43,549
already the application channels come

696
00:31:43,549 --> 00:31:47,570
as alive I allow that it is an analysis of it

697
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:51,470
is a scanner for its exclusion for

698
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:53,419
applications sometimes not yet  They ask you

699
00:31:53,419 --> 00:31:56,629
today if I want to analyze my website

700
00:31:56,629 --> 00:31:59,779
open bass serves me well because this open

701
00:31:59,779 --> 00:32:03,409
base is more focused on making scans

702
00:32:03,409 --> 00:32:05,509
in infrastructures on the host as such

703
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:07,700
in open ports but not on

704
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,529
identifying security gaps that

705
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:14,310
are in web applications

706
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:17,280
and then well  here it is that it was not that it

707
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,400
is another must-see the bar suite there is a

708
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,350
version also that is convenient there is a

709
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:24,390
professional version in the professional

710
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:28,710
because of course there are more

711
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,510
attributes and more components that

712
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,310
help you facilitate the signal starr account,

713
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:35,520
there is true there for  of course not

714
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,140
not to base the results on the

715
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,580
tools but here we are talking

716
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,010
from the vulnerability analysis and

717
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:43,410
here  There is a scope if we were

718
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:45,240
talking about a bridge, it is because the story would be different

719
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,740
and we would be talking about

720
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,860
other correct tools as well

721
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:53,160
or whatsapp is like the open

722
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,130
source version of the bar suite so it

723
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:58,410
is available to anyone if they have a

724
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:01,350
laboratory with full wired linux  And

725
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:04,280
with mud there is also

726
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,280
and good because those are the tools and

727
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,980
you could use it if you are going to do it,

728
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,520
let's say enable a website,

729
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,450
okay

730
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,150
,

731
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:19,030
what happens many times when you go

732
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,900
to audit you find that the

733
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,970
architecture of the application is

734
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:29,500
developed  In for example w in

735
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,130
wordpress

736
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:35,670
or in some content management platform

737
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:38,970
that we know from history from

738
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:40,910
experience that they tend to be

739
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:43,500
vulnerable in time if one is not

740
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,240
doing a correct organization,

741
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,940
then

742
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:52,180
let's say that they are very attractive to

743
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:55,050
make doors  Security are the truth

744
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:58,480
and there is already a scanner that is double or

745
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,000
sometimes I change there are many others

746
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,180
insist  or but it also works and because

747
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,970
connectic's website is a license, it

748
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:09,280
is also a paid tool that helps us

749
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,270
to do that

750
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:14,179
and so we will see an example when

751
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:16,850
we also want to do more

752
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:19,130
specialized, more focused analysis because

753
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:21,739
we already have a target, we already know that

754
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:23,659
it is there.  running on the target what

755
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:26,409
services have what are its ports we

756
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:28,250
identify that it has an

757
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:31,190
ssl certificate because today we want to know what are

758
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:34,340
the intrinsic weaknesses that the

759
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,889
certificate has, it may have algorithms

760
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:38,929
of inscription crisis that are already

761
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:40,969
sinful so it may even be

762
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:43,510
using an ssl and  Today we are using

763
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:47,060
tse version 1.2 upwards the

764
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,800
others are already pre-expensive because they

765
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,139
are already vulnerable so it can be their

766
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:53,149
call and they can also find that is

767
00:34:53,149 --> 00:34:56,360
the scan and put in the port because the

768
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,370
certificate can also not be only

769
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:02,000
installed and in the  443 or in the

770
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,150
web service but also sometimes the sikhs admin

771
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,680
install in their certificates for

772
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,600
rpp connections

773
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,730
and  From there you can also run

774
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:13,130
another type of analysis, especially for

775
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:15,020
service immigration

776
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,300
now that we have identified that

777
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:20,330
the smb protocol is on the server and

778
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,360
that it works as an active directory,

779
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:26,380
then we are going to see if we can

780
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,670
identify which users

781
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:32,540
are created  on the site or if that

782
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,700
active directory is well configured,

783
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,220
not because we use tools such as in

784
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:40,610
a forlin or psoe moves from client, they

785
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:42,950
are already specific for the service that

786
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,720
we want to audit if it reaches

787
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,010
a level where we already

788
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,790
identify that

789
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:52,310
or  Well, there are also scanners at the

790
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:56,420
network level how to save

791
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:00,470
to identify or violate sites and

792
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:02,990
web site portals is the whole suite of

793
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:06,380
craft housecat to search for hashish

794
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,180
identifies passwords etc.

795
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:11,090
then between scanners there are like

796
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:14,000
flavors and colors web voucher

797
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,049


798
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:18,329
then here at this point  of our

799
00:36:18,329 --> 00:36:20,309
talk because we already know that it is a

800
00:36:20,309 --> 00:36:22,469
vulnerability analysis which is the

801
00:36:22,469 --> 00:36:24,299
difference from others to  Analysis what are

802
00:36:24,299 --> 00:36:26,239
the tools that we can use

803
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:29,279
I insist this is not a conversation for

804
00:36:29,279 --> 00:36:32,549
expert people who already design their

805
00:36:32,549 --> 00:36:35,640
own scripts and go beyond a

806
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:40,259
test to a test to a reptile that is not

807
00:36:40,259 --> 00:36:42,839
why I have called it gluten because we

808
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:45,650
We concentrate here on how from my role

809
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:48,029
as a specialist in

810
00:36:48,029 --> 00:36:51,749
information security I can identify I can

811
00:36:51,749 --> 00:36:54,970
do vulnerability analysis it is worth

812
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:56,859
here

813
00:36:56,859 --> 00:36:59,589
in time the time at the end and more

814
00:36:59,589 --> 00:37:02,799
with me with my internet topic because

815
00:37:02,799 --> 00:37:04,779
nothing to do a desktop test

816
00:37:04,779 --> 00:37:06,369
where we do a

817
00:37:06,369 --> 00:37:09,720
vulnerability analysis to a target

818
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:12,190
mounting is not a laboratory to see

819
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,289
what results it gives if they have not yet

820
00:37:14,289 --> 00:37:17,589
had access to identify or have a

821
00:37:17,589 --> 00:37:19,420
report a vulnerability analysis

822
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:22,510
this is one there are many thousands here I

823
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:25,680
bring two specific

824
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,080
of what is the  vulnerability scan

825
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,340
report

826
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,320
here also important one in the

827
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,790
tool in the engine that is

828
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,970
doing the vulnerability scan

829
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:38,850
can configure  rar can

830
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:42,180
say to adapt it to the needs

831
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,730
that one requires and not leave it by

832
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:48,650
default because by default it also

833
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:51,660
produces results by default so the

834
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,790
more personalized the scanner is

835
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,680
the objective, as the better the

836
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,110
results we can obtain, that is to say

837
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:02,070
give it a level  not so basic to the

838
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,440
scanner because sometimes you don't even

839
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,810
do that because it turns on,

840
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:09,390
the scanner service gets up, run read like ave

841
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:12,150
x and pe and the result is already nice to see

842
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:16,680
that this is not about then,

843
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:20,160
well here to see what here it comes  The

844
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,170
second part of the talk and it is

845
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:24,840
where you want to take them and that is what I do

846
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,870
with this vulnerability analysis,

847
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:30,000
what is being delivered is fine or I can

848
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,310
improve those results

849
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:35,230
then of course the

850
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:39,820
result shows what is or what is the

851
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:43,300
severity of 15  of the vulnerabilities

852
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,460
that I am finding in front of the target or

853
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:48,160
the targets here one can scan an

854
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,900
IP or a segment of ips or different ips

855
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,940
randomly what  and I want them to be in

856
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,359
different places,

857
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,989
let's say summarize the same uniforms,

858
00:38:59,989 --> 00:39:02,940
customize as much as you want in

859
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,339
the scanner.

860
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:08,600
Okay, then what happens here? Let's

861
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,580
say you found the result of

862
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:13,090
this example is that there are 63

863
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:17,290
vulnerabilities and that it weighs 63 because

864
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:21,580
averaging there is a level risk

865
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:25,640
3.0 that here gives being here also

866
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,310
copied the table and then of course

867
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:31,220
each vulnerability scanner will

868
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,620
have measurements and criteria

869
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:37,070
for which it is high low critical

870
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:40,130
medium true there are some that align with

871
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:44,180
the cb of as vulnerabilities as

872
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:47,150
vulnerabilities of  the aniseed there are others

873
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:49,820
that there are no results entering you

874
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,260
cannot see ok

875
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:54,880
according to cb 3

876
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,349
this vulnerability is critical because

877
00:39:58,349 --> 00:39:59,520
I am going to show you what

878
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,010
that methodology is or think is that

879
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:04,770
anyone who does this can do it, they

880
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:07,020
can go there  and revalidate whether

881
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,640


882
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,910
or not these vulnerabilities are in that state or not,

883
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,369
and well, here there are flavors and colors, they

884
00:40:14,369 --> 00:40:16,980
are located graphically.  Actually, the

885
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:20,069
report is spectacular so that we do not

886
00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:22,319
tell ourselves lies, it is spectacular, but

887
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,200
that is really, look at the level of

888
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,760
security that the audited systems have. It

889
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:31,170
is another matter. It is also true.

890
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:35,520


891
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,039


892
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:41,089
There is a high medium low or

893
00:40:41,089 --> 00:40:43,380
informational vulnerabilities

894
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,869
here I do not stop to define what it is

895
00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:47,640
to you because it is medium that is low because

896
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,960
if you are curious because as I tell you,

897
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:55,740
each engine that does this type of

898
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,780
analysis has different

899
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,180
criteria parameterized and it is  here the crux of the matter is

900
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,490
true this is one of acne tics

901
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:06,460
says that it is one sometimes they classify

902
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:09,580
casualties as casualties and one goes to review the

903
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:13,270
service and you can have a medium level

904
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:17,470
because an exploit can be designed for

905
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:19,450
that specific service and in the end

906
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:21,960
would raise that ranking

907
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,180
these are the results and this is what

908
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,099
is generally presented to people who

909
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:27,210
request

910
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:30,589
the analysis or that if one commits this

911
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:34,619
access p  ues good because it leaves a lot to

912
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:39,330
say then then well here

913
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,630
I bring you

914
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:44,869
I believe that cbs is well known to everyone

915
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:48,410
and as vulnerabilities

916
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:53,000
consists of version 3.1 and 3.2 now well

917
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,240
let's say in this the improved version

918
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,849
where it then evaluates what happens one

919
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:02,119
When it already obtains

920
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:05,509
these results and as a good security analyst,

921
00:42:05,509 --> 00:42:09,170
it goes and says today it turns out that

922
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:12,470
I did not know 60 vulnerabilities

923
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:16,579
that of some are critical so if

924
00:42:16,579 --> 00:42:20,480
the tool does not have it configured if

925
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,789
in its operation, then the ideal

926
00:42:22,789 --> 00:42:24,619
would be to catch those vulnerabilities  and

927
00:42:24,619 --> 00:42:27,470
evaluate on what the entity is known

928
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:31,880
the context the moment if

929
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,609
really that value that is being given

930
00:42:34,609 --> 00:42:36,890
to the vulnerability is treatable or not and

931
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:39,019
why I say this because what is going to

932
00:42:39,019 --> 00:42:41,029
happen after you deliver the

933
00:42:41,029 --> 00:42:43,009
report is you that  do it or the

934
00:42:43,009 --> 00:42:45,319
company that does it, the entity is going to

935
00:42:45,319 --> 00:42:47,960
say ok about that I am left with the

936
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,359
criticisms that are the ones that matter to me are

937
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:52,670
the ones that cause me the most  Laughing the averages and

938
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,380
the casualties, he left them for later, he cited

939
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,690
because technology cannot because I

940
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:59,029
do not have people who love me and that and there

941
00:42:59,029 --> 00:43:01,800
is the management of vulnerabilities

942
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,020
and I insist on this from a

943
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:06,780
business vision then if we deliver

944
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,310
a product where we say that  A

945
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:10,860
vulnerability is low by the scanner

946
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:13,680
but if we do it and give it a

947
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,680
value of the real criticality as it

948
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,840
can change that vision can change and of

949
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,630
course it can change those actions that

950
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:22,890
are taken against what we are

951
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:25,360
identifying

952
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:28,120
then well here in your word train

953
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,010
open you can find the danish

954
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:31,960
simply adapt it the

955
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,170
copyright all still on the side of the anise of the cbs

956
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:37,240
s there you can find this

957
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,160
information and then it is how one

958
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:42,550
should reevaluate recategorize those

959
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:43,980
vulnerabilities that are finding

960
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:48,730
hear there is a score from no impact

961
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:52,180
none of  criticality This is based on the

962
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:55,200
probability of exploitation and the impact

963
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,270
that it is possible that this

964
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:00,160
vuln  reliability could be

965
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,770
exploited and what would be the impact of it

966
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:06,300
being exploited then, as they are evaluated,

967
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,920
let's say in a range that starts from

968
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,880
0 to 10, where since 0 does not have

969
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,030
or 0 chicks since 0 risk is

970
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:20,170
probability of exploitation decreased from  0 to

971
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:24,370
3 9 and sorry from 0 1 to 3 9 medium from 4 to 6

972
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:29,970
higher than 7 8 9 and critical because 9 and 10

973
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:33,000
then this is a calculator there

974
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,470
you will find the

975
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:38,220
super calculator is super beautiful one just

976
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,260
takes the  parameters that it requires

977
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,630
to model its vulnerability

978
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:46,680
according to the target that it is analyzing

979
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,020
and evaluates it in three very

980
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:53,400
important components the base the temporality and the

981
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,359
environment then the base is what this

982
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:01,320
vulnerability has represented then

983
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,869
what is the vector of act that if it is a

984
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:06,060
through the network or if through the network

985
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:09,599
you have to reach another tary of

986
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,040
escalation of privileges and the attack itself to

987
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,750
exploit that vulnerability, the

988
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:19,920
complexity of the attack may be medium

989
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,240
if you do not  You need a user or your

990
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,089
user needs

991
00:45:27,089 --> 00:45:29,039
first if it requires an

992
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:31,440
administrator user or if it requires

993
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,930
interaction with a user what is the

994
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:35,849
scope of confidentiality, integrity and

995
00:45:35,849 --> 00:45:37,819
availability if you are affecting

996
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:41,519
for example if it is a

997
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:44,069
cryptography vulnerability because you identified it in the

998
00:45:44,069 --> 00:45:46,680
use of the certificate  Sure, then the

999
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,650
vulnerability can be focused on the

1000
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:52,650
denial of service due to the use of

1001
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:54,509
x components, then

1002
00:45:54,509 --> 00:45:57,059
we must be affecting the confidentiality,

1003
00:45:57,059 --> 00:45:58,950
the integrity, the availability, if the

1004
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:02,130
vulnerability concerns an attack or that, well,

1005
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:04,799
it would be the availability

1006
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:06,690
according to then there is one, select the

1007
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:10,259
type of vulnerability or the type of

1008
00:46:10,259 --> 00:46:11,819
scope that the girl is vulnerable to

1009
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:16,170
temporary status to today then to today

1010
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:19,650
July 8 there is an exploit published there is

1011
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:22,729
an exploit ok is explorer is published it

1012
00:46:22,729 --> 00:46:25,950
is within your reach you can design

1013
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:29,339
a script to upload a pay  what

1014
00:46:29,339 --> 00:46:31,680
you already have previously created from

1015
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:32,160
another

1016
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,760
and that

1017
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,400
already ex  They have remediation, that is,

1018
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:40,100
the supplier, the owner, the manufacturer

1019
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:43,130
may have already taken as happened with a good face and

1020
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:45,890
eternal button of terna blood on the wind, it

1021
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:48,200
is from the patch that

1022
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,690
the remediation is already published after that if

1023
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:53,960
I do why not and then  If it affects

1024
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:56,360
confidentiality and there you will

1025
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,250
find some attributes that you

1026
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:01,040
simply select and it will

1027
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,640
calculate

1028
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,970
and the environment here this dimension of the

1029
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:08,820
environment is what that target means

1030
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:11,490
for the organization then you may

1031
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:16,830
be analyzing the portal of the

1032
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:18,720
intranet where the

1033
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,130
internal communications of the

1034
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:23,040
officials are shared to see that if

1035
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,440
the criticality of that asset falls soon as

1036
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,320
it is not high truth then it will

1037
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,810
reduce that impact because it is a

1038
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:33,750
park that is internal that only

1039
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,490
shares information that is not  sensitive type

1040
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:40,020
then there we will evaluate

1041
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:42,630
which is the attack vector the same

1042
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:44,580
attributes that we saw previously but

1043
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:46,500
this is based on the  environment where it

1044
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,630
is stopped because that target is not the

1045
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:52,020
same as the transaction center was evaluated the

1046
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:54,060
transaction portal of

1047
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:56,910
the correct entity

1048
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:58,620
what are the security

1049
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:01,650
requirements availability requirements and the

1050
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:03,870
same attributes that you select but in

1051
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:05,730
this environment in this in this  dimension

1052
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:08,610
based on the inter at the end of this

1053
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:10,560
exercise that will happen that will give you

1054
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:13,080
a score that may be very different from the

1055
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,890
score that I have is the dawn channel of

1056
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:18,150
skills and here you are already

1057
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:20,970
giving a value to your work because  you are

1058
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:22,620
trying to identify if that

1059
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:27,170
vulnerability can be exploitable

1060
00:48:27,579 --> 00:48:31,119
and well it is important to also clarify

1061
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:33,219
that there is a life cycle of

1062
00:48:33,219 --> 00:48:35,469
vulnerabilities and this is not only

1063
00:48:35,469 --> 00:48:38,109
about going to break to scan and that's it,

1064
00:48:38,109 --> 00:48:40,989
my task is over, not this as always like

1065
00:48:40,989 --> 00:48:43,089
me  Then it always has a cycle and the

1066
00:48:43,089 --> 00:48:45,069
vulnerability does not end when I

1067
00:48:45,069 --> 00:48:47,319
identified it, the vulnerability ends

1068
00:48:47,319 --> 00:48:51,009
when I remedy it, I put it in

1069
00:48:51,009 --> 00:48:54,519
production and I go back and test for it.  This

1070
00:48:54,519 --> 00:48:56,290
is what it is about,

1071
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:59,290
as a security analyst, it makes you

1072
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:01,510
laugh that technology tells you, `` Listen now,

1073
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:03,940
patch and dance.

1074
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:06,970


1075
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:10,210


1076
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:12,550


1077
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:15,970
They were effective so here it already

1078
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:18,730
happens and sometimes it also happens I tell you that is

1079
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:20,740
why I put it as from gluten

1080
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:23,410
because sometimes the same people who

1081
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:26,170
identify in which patch or it may be

1082
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:27,460
that the security area is

1083
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:30,190
identifying and they vote the ball to the

1084
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:31,960
area  of technology or the technology agent

1085
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:35,320
who is here watching this

1086
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,330
talk and says hey if that happens to me or it

1087
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:39,700
happens to the company I work for or

1088
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:41,590
when I started to work and when I am in

1089
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:43,600
this environment, it will happen to me because

1090
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,340
this  It is something that has happened in time

1091
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:48,640
and today it is identifying itself more, it

1092
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,880
is the same speed with which it

1093
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,529
identified, it will be the same speed with

1094
00:49:53,529 --> 00:49:55,599
which it left, because what happens, what is the

1095
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:57,579
use of the client once, you

1096
00:49:57,579 --> 00:50:01,470
have 125 thousand  vulnerabilities sorry

1097
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:05,359
because of those 125 I am only going to patch 10

1098
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:08,460
immediately because I can because it does not imply me to

1099
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:11,040
change the version of the server

1100
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,859
upload the current version of the database of the

1101
00:50:13,859 --> 00:50:15,780
database engine in 3

1102
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:21,050
I can then I bring this here

1103
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:23,720
this morning because it is  something like that when

1104
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,540
one from blood index came out

1105
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:28,940
patching vulnerabilities I want to

1106
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:30,950
reach 100% you can as if I am going

1107
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:33,140
up the mountain and I already see the

1108
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:35,810
peak and I think I am five

1109
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:39,980
mountains behind and I am almost going to get

1110
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,600
what is going to  arrive and in the end it is not

1111
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,640
remedying, that is, all this you are

1112
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,680
doing I am throwing it away

1113
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:52,400
there is a very interesting report

1114
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,420
he felt the institute where they made

1115
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:58,310
one is still close to the process

1116
00:50:58,310 --> 00:51:00,740
of vulnerability analysis and he says

1117
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:02,780
that almost 25 percent  One hundred of the

1118
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:04,430
vulnerabilities remain open

1119
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:06,620
throughout the year, sometimes it

1120
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:08,720
becomes a quit that you identify in a

1121
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,450
first scan and then you re-launch

1122
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:13,700
the retest on f  beautiful rita is that one

1123
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:14,990
sometimes also as

1124
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:17,150
law service providers say how it was

1125
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:18,800
added is going to give you a tweet is because

1126
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,950
I know that you will not be able to patch that in

1127
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:23,930
six months

1128
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:25,329
well

1129
00:51:25,329 --> 00:51:28,719
that is the modus operandi of these

1130
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:32,109
analyzes and then  the average time of

1131
00:51:32,109 --> 00:51:36,190
repair or remediation of

1132
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:38,890
vulnerabilities is a minimum of 100 days and

1133
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:40,709
this becomes something that tells us

1134
00:51:40,709 --> 00:51:42,549
where the management of

1135
00:51:42,549 --> 00:51:44,200
vulnerabilities is in all

1136
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,059
capacities and not to decentralize in

1137
00:51:46,059 --> 00:51:48,069
identifying those vulnerabilities but

1138
00:51:48,069 --> 00:51:50,709
in remediating the clear ones  that if

1139
00:51:50,709 --> 00:51:51,880
we just stop to

1140
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,380
identify them, well, now

1141
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:54,789
the problem is for blooming

1142
00:51:54,789 --> 00:51:57,279
when it has to look at what to do with

1143
00:51:57,279 --> 00:51:59,619
those security gaps that

1144
00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:02,680
identified it, then there is

1145
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,509
more detail about that study that is not a

1146
00:52:04,509 --> 00:52:06,819
lie and in  the reality of what happens

1147
00:52:06,819 --> 00:52:08,680
in the industry there I also leave the

1148
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,119
reference

1149
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:12,460
but then here it is not about

1150
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:17,039
generating alerts do not panic

1151
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:20,880
without  However, know that how is the

1152
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,769
movement, how is the modus operandi such

1153
00:52:22,769 --> 00:52:26,339
as the management, since I bring you and

1154
00:52:26,339 --> 00:52:28,529
small sections of that report that

1155
00:52:28,529 --> 00:52:31,529
are very interesting, so there it says,

1156
00:52:31,529 --> 00:52:33,959
for example, that the average time

1157
00:52:33,959 --> 00:52:36,319
measured for remediation of

1158
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,609
vulnerabilities when they are identified

1159
00:52:38,609 --> 00:52:40,890
that  they are for microsoft operating systems it

1160
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:43,979
is 15 times shorter for those

1161
00:52:43,979 --> 00:52:48,829
of oracle ibm hewlett packard

1162
00:52:48,829 --> 00:52:51,239
because well you know that microsoft

1163
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:54,630
every Tuesday every Tuesday publishes

1164
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:56,699
security patches for all its

1165
00:52:56,699 --> 00:52:58,849
systems

1166
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:02,240
for all operating systems so

1167
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,150
that may be one reason  It may be

1168
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:08,359
other than the one that is very curious not because

1169
00:53:08,359 --> 00:53:10,700
one is going to see that management

1170
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:12,680
of the remediation implementation and the

1171
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:15,770
most patched are those of Windows 1 because

1172
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:17,869
because Microsoft has strategies to

1173
00:53:17,869 --> 00:53:20,630
publish patches and that they disappear every Tuesday

1174
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:23,720
and another is because  is to

1175
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:25,880
remedy read them not you are a bit

1176
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:29,180
for people or if to be more specialized

1177
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:31,160
not all exams systems

1178
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,680
operate  tives windows and windows and

1179
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,750
depending on the flavor of windows

1180
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:37,700
it is also not so easy it is not so easy to

1181
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,090
patch

1182
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:44,320
well here I do not stop because I think

1183
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,720
we are running out of time

1184
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,850
so

1185
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:50,670
I leave these s

1186
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:52,500
for example most

1187
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,270
companies are not  They can or can barely

1188
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:56,130
keep up with the rate of exploitation of

1189
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:59,450
vulnerability and sorry

1190
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:05,880
and if here we have to reflect on something if this

1191
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:09,300
is the case for vulnerabilities that

1192
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,990
are already published that already exploits

1193
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:14,400
around the free access internet

1194
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,410
as they will be even more so for

1195
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:19,110
vulnerabilities it should still be

1196
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:22,080
Sometimes it may be because it receives an alert

1197
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,660
from the government sensor because I received

1198
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,460
an alert from miso that begins to

1199
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,530
remedy faster but it does not always pass

1200
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:30,380
mind

1201
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:32,870
and health entities

1202
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:37,180
take less time five times,

1203
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:39,190
let's say five times more  slow to

1204
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:41,619
remedy because it will be good if

1205
00:54:41,619 --> 00:54:44,290
I leave them for your reflection.

1206
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:47,220


1207
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:50,329
Today today there are already solutions and

1208
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:52,240
computer controls that allow us to  They allow us to

1209
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:56,140
patch a little faster

1210
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:00,000
and get rid of this problem that we are

1211
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,270
identifying when we already have the

1212
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:06,000
hot potato, the pot is burning,

1213
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,130
the soup is spreading and I don't know what to

1214
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:10,339
do with all these vulnerabilities,

1215
00:55:10,339 --> 00:55:14,700
so here comes the evaluation of

1216
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,950
those capacities.  in the people that I have

1217
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:19,020
in the tools that I have and

1218
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:21,810
solutions that the industry has created

1219
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:24,359
to leave appear to make our

1220
00:55:24,359 --> 00:55:27,420
heads not hurt and it is hear patch aip virtual file

1221
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:28,170


1222
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:30,930
the famous the famous virtual martín one

1223
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:32,130
of those that I think is very

1224
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:35,040
interesting is the trend micro which is

1225
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,720
called deep security where you

1226
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:42,140
go to islands, the operating system

1227
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:44,390
that is usually vulnerable are the

1228
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:46,700
policies and some indicators of

1229
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,849
compromise that can be

1230
00:55:48,849 --> 00:55:52,070
involved and you leave it with isolated hear

1231
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:54,950
this I'm not  happening I am not applying

1232
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:57,710
because I can not upload the

1233
00:55:57,710 --> 00:56:00,109
operating system but I have it to customize I

1234
00:56:00,109 --> 00:56:02,090
have it protected I am identifying

1235
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:03,740
threats because also  It is used to

1236
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:05,990
identify threats to that

1237
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:09,290
operating system and in a certain way I have

1238
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:11,690
a protection measure and

1239
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:15,770
my level of risk is reduced, so there

1240
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:18,890
was a level of risk, the

1241
00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:21,920
inherent risk when applying the

1242
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,350
vulnerability is reduced and I already have

1243
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:26,240
a risk that the entity is

1244
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,790
accepting if I am from the 2nd from the

1245
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:30,320
computer security team of

1246
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:33,140
technological assurance

1247
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,790
any of the areas and flavors that

1248
00:56:34,790 --> 00:56:36,530
you call those who do

1249
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:38,990
gluten activities

1250
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:41,810
then here apart from these

1251
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:44,450
tools there may be others I

1252
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:46,970
do not know that because there are also

1253
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:49,280
strategies  To address this issue of

1254
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,130
vulnerabilities, which are what

1255
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:55,070
brigades brigades of party brigades can do, for example

1256
00:56:55,070 --> 00:56:58,670
, and where

1257
00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:01,100
all changes are uploaded in a

1258
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:03,790
controlled environment

1259
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:07,690
and therefore the time in which the

1260
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:09,940
vulnerability is open is reduced because one

1261
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:11,800
thing is vulnerability  that I just

1262
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:14,680
found for my unified system and

1263
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,380
another like that can  become an

1264
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:20,500
attack vector reaching through

1265
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,710
other components of the network etc

1266
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:24,700
then here are a series of

1267
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:28,270
alternatives to what I say

1268
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:30,730
migrate brigades walk brigades hire

1269
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:32,650
external people who sell the

1270
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:36,790
rapier patch that may be at risk and

1271
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:39,610
scan with  people are good etc.

1272
00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:42,340
that there are some capacities that I put and

1273
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:45,490
that are extracted from the guide

1274
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:48,400
the enterprise sports management

1275
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,820
technologies of the anise there is also

1276
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:53,619
a compendium of information that can

1277
00:57:53,619 --> 00:57:56,290
be very useful if you are if you

1278
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:59,920
are the leader of security and  that you have to

1279
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,530
go or if you are the penta estero, the

1280
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:04,960
security analyst that you have to

1281
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:08,110
remedy because he tells her how

1282
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:09,850
life has already provided us with people who have

1283
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:11,950
done what we are doing

1284
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:13,990
because they are not going to invent the wheel for me.

1285
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:16,180
to read what they have done so they

1286
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:18,960
can find it

1287
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,680
and well

1288
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,660
after all this he has already told you about

1289
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:27,180
the challenge is to do the same is to try

1290
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:30,480
to create the same script  enario with which it

1291
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,450
was tested once again to create

1292
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:35,790
that same scenario you will see what results it

1293
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:37,620
produces by creating that it is proven that

1294
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:42,420
almost 70% or 50 come out again or

1295
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:45,360
the same vulnerabilities appear

1296
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:49,610
and well with this I am ending our

1297
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:52,320
small space  With this topic, I

1298
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:55,290
thought it was important to share and take away

1299
00:58:55,290 --> 00:58:57,619
the focus a bit from what

1300
00:58:57,619 --> 00:58:59,720
with a vulnerability analysis

1301
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:02,299
we can be, we can

1302
00:59:02,299 --> 00:59:04,880
really identify the level of risk,

1303
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,650
we may fall short or not, you

1304
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:09,890
will already draw your own conclusions and how to

1305
00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:14,839
avoid that simple how to avoid  that

1306
00:59:14,839 --> 00:59:16,400
the fat button application

1307
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,319
becomes a problem for me and

1308
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:21,109
they do not really value my

1309
00:59:21,109 --> 00:59:24,230
knowledge and my title of security analyst

1310
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:25,880


1311
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,610
here this is a vision for the

1312
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:30,290
people behind the

1313
00:59:30,290 --> 00:59:32,090
renting teams which indicators  It could not

1314
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:34,160
be because this is another issue that one

1315
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:38,480
finds a lot in companies

1316
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,730
if they have indicators that measure

1317
00:59:40,730 --> 00:59:42,890
the management of the  s vulnerabilities and

1318
00:59:42,890 --> 00:59:45,170
it is always in the red because they can never

1319
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:47,060
comply because they say I am going to patch in

1320
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:49,970
15 days the criticisms in a month the

1321
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:52,460
average ones and in six months the high ones and they

1322
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:53,960
are never complying because their capabilities

1323
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:57,140
and their strategies do not work, so you have

1324
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:00,290
to formulate a  framework that

1325
01:00:00,290 --> 01:00:03,140
allows to follow a methodology true

1326
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:04,640
because this is not only going to launch the

1327
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,730
scanner this is a methodology

1328
01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:10,450
identified reported treated the

1329
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:12,980
vulnerability the remedy I make a catch

1330
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:16,010
and return identified test etc. It is

1331
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:18,260
a life cycle of the management of

1332
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:20,810
vulnerabilities how  You can identify

1333
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:22,730
if this process is really being

1334
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:25,280
effective with measurements that tell

1335
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,260
me the reality is that my indicator is always in

1336
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:30,050
red when I have to

1337
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:31,730
comply especially

1338
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:34,250
with regulatory agent results to the

1339
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:36,500
superintendencies who is

1340
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,510
monitoring the business because  well here are

1341
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:41,390
some that are also published in the

1342
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:45,200
my 1840 in revision 3a you can already

1343
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,710
find this  to the bibliography

1344
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:50,230
where they tell you how often

1345
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:52,839
the games are checked looking for the

1346
01:00:52,839 --> 01:00:54,849
missing updates this is another

1347
01:00:54,849 --> 01:00:57,880
tweet of the matter it turns out that they go and launch

1348
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:00,240
the vulnerability scanners children

1349
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:05,010
of the mz another server on the plateau sees

1350
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:08,710
another a printer what do I know about the  of the

1351
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:11,710
month etc and then it says so because I do not

1352
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:14,950
mix the targets we mix locations

1353
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:16,780
and to her I think I am at a

1354
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:19,240
risk level and that is a mistake that is a mistake

1355
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:20,980
because you can be so good that

1356
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:22,540
you choose the one who is vulnerable or

1357
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:25,359
So bad that I chose to be that it is well

1358
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:27,990
organized and that it is a critical asset,

1359
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:31,450
so sometimes segmenting those

1360
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:33,480
targets can also become a problem

1361
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:36,520
and can skew the results of the level

1362
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:37,920
of risk,

1363
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,020
although asset inventories are frequently used.

1364
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:42,510


1365
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:44,400
What was I telling you at the beginning if

1366
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,040
I have, I don't even know what I have in my network

1367
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,900
connected and I don't know that it is live or that

1368
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:51,450
this type of indicator

1369
01:01:51,450 --> 01:01:53,910
is not, what is the time?  or minimum average maximum in

1370
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:57,089
applying patches to another another

1371
01:01:57,089 --> 01:01:58,470
important issue here is that sometimes

1372
01:01:58,470 --> 01:02:00,720
change management processes tend to

1373
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:04,140
hinder from deployments

1374
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:07,410
to patches so I can't patch

1375
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:09,510
this until the following Tuesday when

1376
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:11,339
there is a change committee and  It supports me in

1377
01:02:11,339 --> 01:02:13,140
the transition to production because I already tried it,

1378
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:15,059
tests and then I will increase the

1379
01:02:15,059 --> 01:02:17,010
production but that is only approved

1380
01:02:17,010 --> 01:02:19,319
once a month and then until the next

1381
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:22,260
month well or in December or the end

1382
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:23,970
of the month when the operation is at full

1383
01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:26,790
or  I am closing the year in accounting or

1384
01:02:26,790 --> 01:02:28,380
etc. whatever the scenario

1385
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:30,990
I cannot then I have three or

1386
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:32,579
four months left the vulnerabilities are

1387
01:02:32,579 --> 01:02:35,390
identified and I do nothing

1388
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:37,819
these are all real life cases

1389
01:02:37,819 --> 01:02:40,309
I am not inventing anything and if you

1390
01:02:40,309 --> 01:02:41,569
have had the opportunity  If you participate,

1391
01:02:41,569 --> 01:02:44,480
you may be reflecting on

1392
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:48,310
this that I have come to share with you

1393
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:51,220
that more than the average, what percentage

1394
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:53,350
of Jose are complementary  being patched

1395
01:02:53,350 --> 01:02:55,750
at what time what percentage of patches

1396
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:58,840
are applied what cost savings has been

1397
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:01,810
achieved how important this is to at the

1398
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:03,640
end

1399
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:06,880
and show top management at the bar

1400
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,310
bording and what is the return on

1401
01:03:09,310 --> 01:03:12,340
investment they are getting if I'm

1402
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:13,960
doing this guy  of exercises so

1403
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:15,700
that later they do not apply to me, do

1404
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:18,400
not authorize me only a

1405
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,990
vulnerability analysis but some

1406
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:22,240
reptile tests where I do not give anything and look at

1407
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:25,090
how they enter, or in the end everything is a

1408
01:03:25,090 --> 01:03:27,160
cost-benefit balance and like me

1409
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:29,770
I can implement these types of

1410
01:03:29,770 --> 01:03:31,150
exercises so that it gives me a

1411
01:03:31,150 --> 01:03:33,640
holistic view of the risk level of my

1412
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,160
organization

1413
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:38,700
and finally, what percentage of the

1414
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:40,350
budget of the information system

1415
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:42,960
of the agencies the entities dedicate

1416
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,120
the patch management if I have money

1417
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:48,810
to patch or not  if not good then take

1418
01:03:48,810 --> 01:03:50,960
the risk and

1419
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,360
but it is a prayer and saw the

1420
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:56,030
sky attached so that nothing happens to them

1421
01:03:56,030 --> 01:03:58,160
and finally with some conclusions

1422
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:01,250
that were left to them  to their conclusion and

1423
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:03,650
for their review so they can think about whether to

1424
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:06,680
really do an analysis if it is

1425
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:08,480
really only a game vulnerability scan should be done

1426
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,790
to the

1427
01:04:10,790 --> 01:04:14,120
most critical assets or not if it should be

1428
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,470
done to all the assets of the

1429
01:04:15,470 --> 01:04:17,870
organization or  If again, do a

1430
01:04:17,870 --> 01:04:20,140
vulnerability analysis and focus

1431
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:24,020
on doing another type of test and especially

1432
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:27,740
here I was missing one if I am doing a

1433
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:29,450


1434
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:31,910
fat button vulnerability analysis I am giving an added value to

1435
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:34,880
what by scope is a generality analysis

1436

1437
01:04:36,530 --> 01:04:40,280
and  Well with this ended, thank you very much

what I have shown you and will serve you for

fantastic detailed presentation.

1447
01:05:22,659 --> 01:05:24,909
It is very clear that the analysis of

are the weaknesses or errors at the

well here undoubtedly

01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:58,700
find rdp connections or

1461
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:01,820
open ports  For connections to rpp,

1462
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:04,850
other tests that we have carried out and that

1463
01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:07,700
we have found to be very common and that

1464
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:09,860
is when one is directly auditing

1465
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:13,310
targets such as active directory, their chip,

1466
01:06:13,310 --> 01:06:16,520
especially active directors and tests

1467
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:18,440
the vulnerabilities or tests the

1468
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:20,660
exploits or simply testing if it is

1469
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:23,960
vulnerable  or not from that version of smb to the

1470

exploit that is published and from

the users who are published in the

1474
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:38,150
are always bad configurations that are made

1477
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:47,380
