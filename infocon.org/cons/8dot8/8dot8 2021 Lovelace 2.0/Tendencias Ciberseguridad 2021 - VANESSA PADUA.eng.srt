00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:20,269
strategy that is not always aligned

170
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:25,879
or in the head  it's more you are in this 5

171
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:30,470
money is stubborn there also in the

172
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:33,800
organization in the market take more and Mike

173
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,370
warn a different look from belts and

174
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:41,769
cases to pull companies to improve

175
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:46,399
Silas surfaces to understand a

176
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,699
little human due to maturity he just stays

177
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:54,290
there, right And also  to tie differently, it

178
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:58,040
is capable of having an am for the same time as

179
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,050
the defenses by the company. These

180
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,610
are the box of having an am and also this one

181
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,819
available in this and it the internet is not

182
00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:10,140
put for this and the important ones are not

183
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:15,240
and when we are walking it we already have it

184
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,660
technology No hurry how it

185
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:24,300
technology the exam hello Ronaldo if then

186
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,460
if with one for example it will be

187
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,850
compressed Where is connecting with the

188
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:34,140
quickly you can lighthouse or with it it me

189
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,510
lends And when this

190
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,630
is more and more created and is step by step poets asks

191
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,960
environment author John and he just the

192
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,920
type of blood for the cells

193
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,130
exercises or in this topic take this

194
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:55,050
hydration so let's pray to see if

195
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:59,960
a star is born until receiving hold in

196
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,850
agony.  As soon as he's passing by or in his

197
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,880
head at Zap and

198
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,280
Oi and the only works if and technologies are

199
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,260
different platforms And screw this one

200
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:15,200
It matters and we didn't use my his

201
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,130
it fan at 20 then lounge of a

202
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:22,280
platform is that if Dior I was far

203
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:26,000
beyond Ernesto  and good thing about it, this one and

204
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,830
more and more companies have it in a

205
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:35,900
single one.  Visibility of all solutions

206
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:41,300
nest in the normalization of statuses

207
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,480
so that there is a correlation and

208
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,040
context companies can Congratulations but

209
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:54,740
it is automated for example as it is,

210
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,670
but your fourth is good for creating tickets

211
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:02,740
when pure and and other tips so

212
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,889
when we go through

213
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:10,319
the  website of the exercises that

214
00:15:10,319 --> 00:15:13,199
actually solves the ex air platform and that

215
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,290
sneakers can create Many of them What

216
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,889
could we really do to identify the mummy?

217
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:21,779


218
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:23,839


219
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,489


220
00:15:26,489 --> 00:15:32,540
World the

221
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,119
principles lead you will hold

222
00:15:35,119 --> 00:15:38,639
too small and time for us to go to the

223
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,999
beings is there to take revenge where here is

224
00:15:43,999 --> 00:15:47,970
spent was the documents and super

225
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:51,869
interesting about Las trends

226
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:54,749
if you look straight beyond the symptoms

227
00:15:54,749 --> 00:15:57,959
of via goal and Security  and the

228
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:03,989
other nervous letter and it came because this one's just the

229
00:16:03,989 --> 00:16:04,870
dust

230
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:07,480
and yes I don't know, you have to think about the year that you

231
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,870
will understand as the same time to not

232
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,779
his and it's just because there the companies

233
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:16,960
are more and more commonplace, hours

234
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,420
more and more watching the park so

235
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,820
the technology is if I follow

236
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,400
the company's business park So look now you

237
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,200
have to die for us let's go This will

238
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,980
be the look we walked  it's always the theme

239
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,290
she's always in such a hurry for

240
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:38,440
something she prints or I'm here it's all right

241
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,800
connect the

242
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,370
first Pontoon turn it on Cyber Security

243
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:48,930
move me it's not just that one day and

244
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,910
she Madureira is interested in whatever

245
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:54,899
happens in the world this isn't the Island  but as

246
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:57,240
soon as companies

247
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,279
try to successfully use all the systems n you can't

248
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:06,300
buy forever and part and there in the

249
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,400
Republic or indifferent to Facebook

250
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,569
Sic and this is your hybrid world' in my

251
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:26,400
name is I'm in compliance where

252
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,179
this  oh huh crazy i have and how to

253
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:32,790
occupy it also has visibility

254
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,679
what is going on and why

255
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:38,280
this diet happened here?

256
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,929


257
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:40,809


258
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:46,659
s are access beyond

259
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:48,279
the conditions many who don't know how to

260
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:51,159
write no problem i don't have

261
00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:55,260
to sign one day

262
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,650
the company to understand this glow of the party

263
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,420
i hadn't even visualized but to

264
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,570
meet this there is information here again

265
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:06,510
single or what i'm not even giving  what

266
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,910
is not natan or inside the

267
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,460
cleaning this super issue is

268
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:17,370
important Portugal he increased to

269
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:22,260
turn off and in this crazy world and it's

270
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,090
right because God has the way of

271
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:31,890
Google 2:30 it's not until you understand that if you

272
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:35,420
rise and you are  passing need

273
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:41,700
lends dust and this Know

274
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,880
I Hurt You theme also has a

275
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,540
supply curve and Robin next Marco for himself

276
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,480
when the band from this Google where he

277
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,240
dates Everson and different areas of

278
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,320
the play had different to always grateful

279
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,429
so quickly  and ours felt Aruda

280
00:19:03,429 --> 00:19:07,050
technology so the problem

281
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:11,020
seems impossible and for that company

282
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:15,940
to turn and drag and improve and

283
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,240
thus not have to hold anything more than when

284
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,150
this issue in the legs  and on your feet you can't

285
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:27,340
stay on that is to create two 12

286
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:32,170
these 2 don't need up to three years and this

287
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:35,260
classic posthumanism and Cloud protection

288
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:39,700
Plus is just not a name not only does not deserve

289
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,600
technology brands are the target of another

290
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,300
160 remember is something they guarantee  created

291
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,480
as the types of platforms and

292
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,650
increase and can bet on their

293
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,250
own companies the student must continue

294
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,900
and where we are now where does defending

295
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,790
solve this Technologies for us I

296
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:05,570
could already meet but ground visibility

297
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:11,720
So it's only while they were to mix

298
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:17,090
and so do I  I want to find a function

299
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,030
where I can on the other hand The

300
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:32,930
Italian left side and they and I folded

301
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:38,530
a coffee protest let's arrange

302
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:42,650
different workloads yesterday I have

303
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:45,890
Servers world the different FPS counter

304
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:49,340
different paired devices and I

305
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:55,100
have countermine Saci etc and for the  rest

306
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:59,600
and there platform.net continues and

307
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,419
waking up and betraying multi value for the

308
00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:05,179
company and you know here the but

309
00:21:05,179 --> 00:21:07,010
any thoughts for my uncle who sees  then

310
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:09,710
approve this one to improve it, this is the

311
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,780
land of my company if this one

312
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,780
is about the PP only the two technologies

313
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,360
and the daily payment in this one

314
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,860
at the other end and it only sells Cyber and

315
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,320
work in a World economic forum that

316
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,220
women Attract a lot  that's why

317
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:31,150
I always thought that giving you this part

318
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,580
of a business is not that it's a

319
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:41,250
residence and operational S Pátria and this

320
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:46,530
or gets to bleed

321
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:49,830


322
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:54,460


323
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:57,340
nearby  Hold without his part, I just

324
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:00,250
asked if he's the World economic forum

325
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:03,400
side of the document they are the

326
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,450
principles she is giving to Apodi

327
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:11,830
Arno for them printed if to create more

328
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,159
alternatives to hold the load if what

329
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:21,419
love did not isolate ISO was a statue And

330
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:25,059
tie with the technical terms and it

331
00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:27,200
combined for the terms, right

332
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,990
Oi and to be with which the

333
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:33,500
business part of the company is going to be held and it can

334

print in income Dias gol e los retos

335
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:44,039
which are security policies

336
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:47,100
the other point of  garder la consolidation

337
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,460
of november yes so if you are not

338
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:55,259
going to use Minecraft to identify which

339
00:22:55,259 --> 00:23:00,499
one is the debtor Candida and also and

340
00:23:00,499 --> 00:23:04,710
from the companies and it to the old man

341
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:07,889
Ok that was the most generating

342
00:23:07,889 --> 00:23:11,729
small companies, right try

343
00:23:11,729 --> 00:23:17,429
different security products and  42 different

344
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:22,129
from 40 seeing where the sky is and I always

345
00:23:22,129 --> 00:23:25,650
edit the companies that the guest

346
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:28,560

347
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:33,960
thinks What's the point in pharmacy not

348
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,850

the playlist company for Candida in this

350
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,070
Culture if  I need to deal with snakes

351
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:43,049
just go there to take this away

352
00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:46,950
and this takes us to a point Porto East

353
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,600
So many years we'll take care

354
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:55,110
we'll error complexity if and slime Mira

355
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:59,249
we walked this verse or we can

356
00:23:59,249 --> 00:24:01,860
Congratulations but for Raila advice this

357
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,769
next year I cheered  and I don't even live in

358
00:24:04,769 --> 00:24:08,129
drying automation because wherever I

359
00:24:08,129 --> 00:24:12,779
use it I'm grateful for this theme of wear and tear and

360
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:14,940
professionalizing achieved in a

361
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,970
relationship and it changed the

362
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:21,239
ra dear information

363
00:24:21,239 --> 00:24:23,190
about the solution in this period the woman

364
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:30,389
like Ero to improve this theme

365
00:24:30,389 --> 00:24:33,119
of running car for another woman the

366
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:35,210
best to understand more and more

367
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:39,450
automation n is printed

368
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,760
And if I don't use different

369
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,760
technologies why will we turn there in

370
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,090
In this environment we have solutions for

371
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:50,760
example and identity because I already have

372
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:55,260
login access people I have

373
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,809
Luciana's coffee of different types for

374
00:24:57,809 --> 00:25:03,139
example I owe lighthouse of dependency references in

375
00:25:03,139 --> 00:25:08,519
this one of thanks as

376
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:12,649
support so that I'm more and more

377
00:25:12,649 --> 00:25:15,570
orchestrated and  Automated then yours

378
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,460
It seems like there's a cat cough, right, the game

379
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:21,000
can improve if I still use more

380
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,490
and more to solve this issue of

381
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:26,450
what you asked to consolidate and the integration

382
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:27,970
super

383
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:32,710
the other Kátia showed me a cat cough,

384
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:36,570
right And she consolidated in  one is to

385
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:39,260
identify your Hotel Room

386
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:43,130
to be the world but the hybrid Indian understood

387
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:46,340
you will have lock the poet of identity

388
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,820
in the others this one in our underwear and this

389
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:52,580
one claimed not  what if I brought it is young man that every time

390
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:57,850
but crear Y is to act and build

391
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:02,390
solutions that of ready technologist

392
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:05,630
authentication of the poet is at this moment and

393
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:09,350
access the small group Most

394
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:13,070
currents and today we are in print are

395
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:17,159
being fluff and see if  What are you thinking Filet

396
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:20,190
I really want to know if I'm cured

397
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:22,799
because at the company we have or a

398
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:27,029
factor I doubled to find only username

399
00:26:27,029 --> 00:26:30,929
and password so if there and

400
00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:34,440
some identities for the queue then I already know what

401
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,739
we're close to our Hay that  targeting there

402
00:26:37,739 --> 00:26:42,139
he gives you he has a problem with

403
00:26:42,139 --> 00:26:47,999
positive platoons and here where we are or

404
00:26:47,999 --> 00:26:52,409
in the increasingly modern culture of

405
00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:55,919
Silvestre and there texture is in the opening

406
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,330
that attracts he can say others there

407
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:05,789
trust Selma if this candy is always

408
00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:09,779
ox it is  the second the verification by the

409
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:13,590
user remain It doesn't matter if Vanessa

410
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:17,170
is already this is one I'm pa

411
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:22,360
the coffin at Vanessa's movement and

412
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,030
there is no Diogo is to continue like

413
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:28,660
this inside this one so this one is in this Cassol and

414
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:31,030
honestly the land of this other does s  I

415
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:33,460
work poetic there identity was another

416
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:36,820
mind he says the following if the Health

417
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:42,120
device device is the notion to

418
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,300

421
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:58,720
when it is  only this is if they don't think it

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,130
's

423
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:03,820

person Vanessa you are love of several coughs and

425
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:11,320
turkey and in this movement it

426
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,710
will always be him who is I've already said it

427
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:18,250
gives and also to wear Vanessa's glasses

428
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:21,090
I don't even know a strategy of others

429
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:23,200
for the ass in companies are

430
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,980

day and it's for companies and

432
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,700
in this movement every German we understand

433
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:37,320
nothing is the return and the reader is not If it

434

00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:55,580
we can't trust or rather then if there's a

438
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:58,550
need to think and create in this land more

439

environment is important for companies and

don't suffer from technology that understand a

485
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:15,290
little but you mean this issue and

486
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:17,900
it's realizing then hold the

487
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,630
environment until it died  Catarina takes into

488
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:24,760
account that as her workload move,

489

there the public notice, if you

495
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,730
can hold it where it is, I always thought that

496
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:57,870
giving it sustainability these one

497
