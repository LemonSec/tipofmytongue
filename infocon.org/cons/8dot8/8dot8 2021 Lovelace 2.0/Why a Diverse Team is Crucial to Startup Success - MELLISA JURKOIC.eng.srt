be here to talk to you all today

53
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,440
about a little bit of the what i call

54
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,200
like the human side of technology i

55
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,080
think um

56
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,560
we as technologists love the bright and

57
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,120
shiny

58
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,680
objects that we get all the time and new

59
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,440
revelations and technology

60
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,200
um but we often forget about the people

61
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,200
that are consuming it as well as um the

62
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,319
team that makes up

63
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,120
um our own organizations that allow us

64
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,440
to have such great innovation

65
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,879
so i want to spend some time talking to

66
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,440
you today about why i have seen in my

67
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,360
own experience why we at diversify

68
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,000
thinking

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,640
and also my own experience in startups

70
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,280
have seen

71
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,959
a great uh outcome from having diversity

72
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,040
across the team and why that's important

73
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,879
um i know here i say it's crucial to

74
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,400
startup success i'm sure some of you

75
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,319
with us today maybe don't come from a

76
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,840
startup background and i'm here to tell

77
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,239
you

78
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,319
apply it to your own context a team

79
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,040
within a larger corporation for example

80
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,680
um a team that you're just starting some

81
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,280
sort of grassroots initiative that

82
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,720
you're building within your own company

83
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,599
is sort of an entre

84
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,000
entrepreneur um any kind of context that

85
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,519
you're in i promise you that there are

86
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,480
things that you're going to take away

87
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,840
from my talk today that you're going to

88
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,280
be able to apply

89
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,040
and it could be advice that you share to

90
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,200
other leadership representatives so i

91
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,720
also love to say that you can lead from

92
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,760
any chair so

93
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,200
don't think as you're listening to me oh

94
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,879
melissa this is great but i'm not

95
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,879
a c-level executive or i'm not a

96
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,959
director i don't have a team i'm not a

97
00:03:58,959 --> 00:03:59,760
manager

98
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,159
i promise you um part of inclusion is

99
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,680
making sure that everyone has a voice

100
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,840
so you have a voice regardless of where

101
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,799
you sit and

102
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,560
again like lead from any chair i'm a big

103
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,319
proponent of that

104
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,319
so i want to dive right in and start to

105
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,000
talk about you know where do you start

106
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,160
i mean diversity is a pretty huge topic

107
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,279
um it can be

108
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,120
really really overwhelming i think it is

109
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,399
for quite a few people leaders and

110
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,519
otherwise um

111
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,360
and because it can be overwhelming we

112
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,280
often get a little bit

113
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,199
um paralyzed by it and we're not sure

114
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,400
where to start so i'm here to tell you

115
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,600
it's really simple

116
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,759
step one is the simplest step it's

117
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,280
really defining what diversity is in

118
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,560
your context

119
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,040
um you know there's there's lots of

120
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,560
articles out there and i've read one

121
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,240
just this morning actually where

122
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,080
the de facto standard for diversity and

123
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,400
where our minds ultimately go

124
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,199
90 of the time is gender and race um and

125
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,160
there's a reason why

126
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,040
um we certainly have a lot of work to be

127
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,560
done in those particular

128
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,360
areas but i want to challenge your

129
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,160
thought today

130
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,800
again um to think differently about

131
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,639
diversity there's a lot of what we call

132
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,320
here at diversify thinking dimensions of

133
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,240
diversity and we explore those um

134
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:04,800
through

135
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,639
some of the events that we've held um

136
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,240
like she mentioned during my intro but

137
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,400
also just conversations and programs

138
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,759
that we put together

139
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,199
and when i say different dimensions

140
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,039
diversity what i'm talking about here is

141
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,639
think beyond race and gender

142
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,720
think beyond what you can even see um so

143
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,800
there's there's the neurodiverse

144
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,960
you know so you know people with autism

145
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,479
for example

146
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,240
that's a that's an element of diversity

147
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,240
um people that have other sort of

148
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,600
mental illness or even like

149
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,919
differences mentally that's an element

150
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,120
of diversity

151
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,240
um age is a big one uh age

152
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,759
ageism is also a big thing in our

153
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,280
society um

154
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,759
worldwide right so i think just really

155
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,320
challenge

156
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,039
to think about not just gender and race

157
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:47,520
but

158
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,160
all these different dimensions and then

159
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,759
think about what that means to you so

160
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,280
there's great initiatives out there and

161
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,199
i really obviously support them for

162
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,600
for clear reasons as being a female in

163
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,960
the tech industry

164
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,800
um a great one is you we're going to be

165
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,160
gender diverse 50 50 by 2025 i've heard

166
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,199
this quite a bit and that's

167
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,000
an amazing goal to have um and i support

168
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,440
it again as i said

169
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,360
now that's one definition of diversity

170
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,880
and that might be where you're headed

171
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,560
that might be as an organization

172
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,400
you look across where you're at and you

173
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,840
understand your gaps and you make a

174
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,840
definition of your goals and diversity

175
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,199
to be meaningful to you and that's what

176
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,039
i mean by in your context because maybe

177
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,960
gender diversity is a huge gap that you

178
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,680
have

179
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,759
um maybe you're a very male dominated

180
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,319
team organization etc

181
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,120
and you want to change that i applaud

182
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,520
you

183
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,520
recognizing that is the first step and

184
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,520
defining that but just make sure you

185
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,039
understand and you all are aligned

186
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,479
around what that means

187
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,960
and this sounds really simple but write

188
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,080
it down

189
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,680
um just like a mission statement as you

190
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,280
would for your company or the vision and

191
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,560
goals and that's how you set your

192
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,599
roadmap

193
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,520
um you don't know what your destination

194
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,880
is then you're not going to get there

195
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,360
um so set clear expectations around what

196
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,240
the destination is if it's 50 50 by 2025

197
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,319
or if it's something around ethnic

198
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,440
diversity

199
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,720
um or personality diversity

200
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,120
or background diversity whatever it is

201
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,720
for you just be really super clear

202
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,919
define it write it down

203
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:10,880
because now you're going to have the

204
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,720
destination that you're headed towards

205
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,520
and and that's

206
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,000
again the very first step and that's how

207
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,280
you sort of overcome some of the

208
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,080
overwhelm

209
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,840
is you identify those things and define

210
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,160
them and why is it important to define

211
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,280
it because i can't

212
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,199
get directions to get to a destination

213
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,639
if i don't know where i'm going

214
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,319
so if i don't know that the most

215
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,759
important thing to me

216
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,240
is gender then i won't know what steps i

217
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,759
need to take to build an action plan to

218
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,880
get there

219
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,199
so that's why i'm saying the first first

220
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,039
and most crucial steps in this journey

221
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,039
is to define what diversity means in

222
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,560
your context and again

223
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,319
there's not a wrong or right answer we

224
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,479
often get like that paralysis around

225
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:47,599
feeling like

226
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,639
well we have to encompass race we have

227
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,520
to

228
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,479
encompass age we have to encompass

229
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,599
religion

230
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,160
economic status any of these things

231
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,080
there is no have to there is what is

232
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,120
important to you

233
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,840
as in your current context and what is

234
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,879
the gap

235
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,960
and why why is it important like that's

236
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,280
what i want you to define

237
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,360
and you know i often say once you define

238
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,120
that let it be your superpower this is

239
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,479
really really crucial in

240
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,120
the startup world um because you can

241
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,919
leverage that

242
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,360
for so many different aspects which

243
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,639
we'll talk about a little bit more in

244
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,759
just a second

245
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,840
but i do say that you know and it not

246
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,199
just in just but let it be your

247
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,120
superpower there's so many great

248
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,000
benefits of having a diverse team um it

249
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,400
can

250
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,519
actually propel you forward so define it

251
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,240
first

252
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,000
understand what it is you're trying to

253
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,599
achieve where your gaps are

254
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,479
what does diversity mean to you for your

255
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,440
current

256
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,640
team context whatever that is for you

257
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,000
again i challenge you if you're not in a

258
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,040
startup today

259
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,160
these words still matter um and again

260
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,800
like do that first so now you've got a

261
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,640
clear definition you know

262
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,839
what diversity is for you you understand

263
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,440
that it's important

264
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,160
what do you do next um well and when do

265
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,959
you start

266
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,920
right now and again defining it is that

267
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,200
first step but

268
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,399
um you know a lot of us as technologists

269
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,320
of course in cyber security and other

270
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,760
fields i'm sure that we've heard the

271
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,519
term technical debt um i love this

272
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,640
parallel because

273
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,959
i at being you know an engineer for many

274
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,160
years experienced

275
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,120
both maybe implementing what was

276
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,120
technical debt as well as

277
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,480
suffering through it on the other side

278
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,160
of that when i was in product management

279
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,040
um and not being able to promote things

280
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,800
on a road map because of technical debt

281
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,080
because it would be too expensive

282
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,519
because of things that we didn't fix

283
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,560
previously

284
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,839
um there's lots of good reasons to do

285
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,680
that right so i think um technical debt

286
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,240
is

287
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,720
we think of it as like a bad bad thing a

288
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,800
naughty word or whatever but really it's

289
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,560
it's a and happenstance that happens

290
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,920
because we have deadlines that we have

291
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,000
to meet we have to make sacrifices um

292
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,680
sometimes in order to do that and that's

293
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,279
sometimes what emerges from that is

294
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,640
technical debt right we make some hard

295
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,839
decisions

296
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,160
um it's not that different in diversity

297
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,680
so i love this parallel of

298
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,600
and this is true right people have this

299
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,000
diversity debt which just means

300
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,320
when you make those tough decisions to

301
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,480
not implement a program because this

302
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,920
needs to be something that's an official

303
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,279
program and part of your business

304
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,160
strategy

305
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,600
but when you make a decision not to do

306
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
that because you're growing so fast

307
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,800
you don't have time and you don't know

308
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,640
where to start and all of those you know

309
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,360
overwhelm

310
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,320
reasons you will accrue diversity debt

311
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,040
um

312
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,440
so there's no better time to start um

313
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,200
than of course yesterday but

314
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,519
but here you are um i often say like

315
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,360
like well-established companies have

316
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,560
a lot larger challenge with this why is

317
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,200
that

318
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
because they didn't start early um they

319
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,880
didn't start on day one and like we had

320
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,079
diversified thinking

321
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,519
have this model where we want to help

322
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,160
leaders of any organization of any size

323
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,839
but we like to focus on startups because

324
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:46,880
we believe those are the

325
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,600
the companies of our future we want to

326
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,040
help them on day one

327
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,440
start to implement even the thought

328
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,120
around this like defining what it means

329
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,720
to you and what your goals are

330
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,959
because if you don't you're going to get

331
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,720
so um

332
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,079
i guess your team's going to get so

333
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,079
large that it's hard to dial back from

334
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:04,399
that

335
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,480
um and it's it's hard to look across and

336
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,720
say oh geez now we are a homogeneous

337
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,240
group of people

338
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,120
how do we implement diversity now um so

339
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,720
it's a lot easier when you're a smaller

340
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,200
team

341
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,959
it's a lot easier to think about it as

342
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,279
part of like the ground foundation

343
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,320
of your business so that's why we really

344
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,399
kind of harp on not accruing diversity

345
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,440
debt because it is

346
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,360
something that happens unfortunately

347
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,800
really fast i mean just like technical

348
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,680
debt

349
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,040
before you know it you're kind of

350
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,279
sitting on top of a pile of it and

351
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,360
we all know i know i have suffered this

352
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,279
as well you don't really go back and fix

353
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,040
it um because it's expensive

354
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,320
so there is an investment in doing this

355
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,240
but the investment is actually greater

356
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,200
if you wait

357
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,519
so diversity debt can also have dollar

358
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,279
signs associated to it so

359
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,360
certainly starting on the first day and

360
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,560
thinking about it um

361
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,120
makes a huge huge difference so you know

362
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,240
what it is

363
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,920
you know when you need to start which is

364
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,360
immediately

365
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,839
where do you start and and like how do

366
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,360
you do that and why does it matter

367
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,880
um so

368
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,880
we always say start at the top right so

369
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,040
your why because your leadership team

370
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,880
for many reasons um your leadership team

371
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,200
is

372
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,040
what represents your company to the

373
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,279
outside world um that's through

374
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,800
speaking engagements like me here

375
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,639
talking to you today um

376
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,000
it's sort of all the marketing messaging

377
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,120
all the um interactions with customers

378
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,320
in the market

379
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,920
you know and if your leadership team is

380
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,839
homogeneous um

381
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,760
and you don't have represents of

382
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,360
representatives of the identity of your

383
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,160
customers

384
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,600
they're not going to relate to you so

385
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,440
there's a business impact there right

386
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,120
huge business impact um and so

387
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,920
you know i think we need to recognize

388
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,720
that

389
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,440
this has an impact and we have a way to

390
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,800
get around this so

391
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,639
you know it's it's interesting because

392
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,160
um you know 65 percent what is this

393
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,040
number you know

394
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,680
why why does this matter and it really

395
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,480
is around

396
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,800
you know the the way that leadership is

397
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,800
diversified across startups today

398
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,800
so you know there's a direct correlation

399
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,839
to

400
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,760
the diversity of leadership and the

401
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,279
performance and direction of your

402
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,320
your company your organization your

403
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,000
roadmap and it does set the tone for

404
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,800
that so

405
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,160
so i challenge you to really think about

406
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,079
that start from the top um

407
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,399
there's a lot of data that has showed

408
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,440
that um

409
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,480
an ethnic diverse founding group

410
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,320
will outperform all white founders by 30

411
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,120
so that means a lot to people that are

412
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,800
investing in your company

413
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,320
so 30 percent 30 is not

414
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,760
something to block at right that's not

415
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,000
like 0.5 there's a lot of dollar signs

416
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,600
associated to that

417
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,399
43 of companies with diverse sports have

418
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,600
higher profits

419
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,839
so the leadership and the advisory of

420
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,160
your organizations really does have

421
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,880
an impact on this um you know founders

422
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,959
have two times more likely to get an

423
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,959
investment

424
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,800
if they have gender diverse founding

425
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,199
teams so that's around gender right i

426
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,079
mentioned there's a lot of different

427
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,760
dimensions of diversity

428
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,800
um 2.6 times more if it's led by women

429
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,639
and then this one's this one's something

430
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,720
that really really um

431
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,360
makes me smile three times more likely

432
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:23,839
to get

433
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,480
invested in if there's a female ceo now

434
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,600
what does that mean

435
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,720
do not go hire a female ceo or go

436
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,600
recruit a female

437
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,240
female ceo just because i told you it

438
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,680
was you're three times more likely to

439
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,079
get

440
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,880
funding that is not how i want you to

441
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,680
approach this

442
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,000
that's not the next action step i want

443
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,120
you to approach this

444
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,639
because i want you to understand and

445
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,480
build diversity into

446
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,240
the thought process you have around

447
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,920
planning your leadership team acquiring

448
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,279
leadership team

449
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,880
and and thinking through that but i

450
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,800
don't want you to tokenize it right so i

451
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,920
don't want a c level rule

452
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,120
as as a female executive um to be

453
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,959
tokenized i want it because i am the

454
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,480
right person for the job and i have the

455
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,680
right

456
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,360
level of experience and qualities that

457
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,800
you're looking for right

458
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,240
so we see people like i like to call

459
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:10,959
this block check

460
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,800
box checkers don't be a box checker

461
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,560
right don't don't let diversity be a

462
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,760
thing that you check off a list

463
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,680
okay i've got a female ceo moving on

464
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,360
like you need to be really serious about

465
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,639
it you need to be committed to it and

466
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,160
you need to ingrain it into your culture

467
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,600
and just the way that you think

468
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,760
so and it does have a dramatic business

469
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,279
impact i mean that's that's what these

470
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,800
numbers are showing us

471
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,800
and and i want to make sure that you all

472
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,040
understand how important that is

473
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,279
so that we can use this as a first step

474
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,800
so you know what diversity is in your

475
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,639
context and maybe it is gender

476
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,000
that is your focus because that's where

477
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,639
your biggest gap is maybe it's ethnicity

478
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,399
or one of the other dimensions but

479
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,759
you've defined it and you know that you

480
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,279
need to start immediately there is no

481
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:47,759
waiting

482
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,120
the waiting actually accrues that

483
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,199
diversity debt and you know where to

484
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,720
start you need to start at the top

485
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,959
but like how you know and so i hear i

486
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,160
say you know you should start with the

487
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,680
hiring we just talked about that

488
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,560
um and be really intentional about it

489
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,920
right so

490
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,399
but you can't stop there um so hiring is

491
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,000
the first part we want to invite people

492
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,399
in

493
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,800
um and we want to you know make sure

494
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,440
that people feel like we're open to it

495
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,839
and that we want a diverse team and that

496
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,120
we have a diverse team so

497
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,560
that's why the leadership team being

498
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,000
diverse also by the way is really

499
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,519
important as you grow

500
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,240
because a lot of us look at the

501
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:22,880
companies

502
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,399
and what they look like to see if we

503
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,160
want to join them i know that i do that

504
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,600
right so um inclusive companies are 1.7

505
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,199
times more likely to be innovative

506
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,560
leaders in their market

507
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,560
and two-thirds of job seekers consider

508
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,000
diversity an important factor

509
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,160
so so this matters what you look like to

510
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,199
the outside world

511
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,480
also matters from a recruiting

512
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,959
perspective the language you use when

513
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,160
you post jobs

514
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,480
like how complex and how long the

515
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,600
requirements are for

516
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,120
for your job listings matter um

517
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,120
some may not be aware but this is a this

518
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,560
is also a hard truth

519
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,839
so women if we see a job description and

520
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,440
i i've fallen prey to this so i can

521
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,800
speak to it it is very real

522
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,279
on this the stigma if we see a job

523
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,720
description with ten

524
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,760
requirements for that job and we only

525
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,880
meet nine of them

526
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,439
i mean nine out of ten that's a pretty

527
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,039
large amount that we've covered if we

528
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,160
only need nine of them

529
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,000
um we won't apply we will not apply to

530
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,599
that job

531
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,000
but a man if they see like one or two

532
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,199
out of ten that they have they'll be

533
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,480
like oh cool i can do this and they'll

534
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:24,959
apply

535
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,199
so we have to be careful about what we

536
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,400
put out there knowing that and i'm

537
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,160
telling you openly that is a very hard

538
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,760
truth but it is the truth and i've had

539
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,120
other women tell me they do the same

540
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,520
thing

541
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,679
we just we undervalue ourselves and we

542
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,880
look at that and we're like oh we have

543
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,280
to

544
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,120
take all the boxes or we can't apply

545
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,039
possibly we should we wouldn't be a good

546
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:41,919
fit

547
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,200
um which aside now on fit

548
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,600
our head of people here adaptation

549
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,960
educated me quite

550
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,080
um intimately around like the term

551
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,440
cultural fit

552
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,360
um and it's interesting like i would

553
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,640
actually challenge you all to remove it

554
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,320
from your language because we have and

555
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,160
it's been a huge

556
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,320
i would say mindset shift um really

557
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,840
important one in the in the journey of

558
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,120
diversity inclusion

559
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,320
and so what we say now is cultural ad um

560
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,840
so our is that person a cultural

561
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,080
addition to our team um because fit

562
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,400
assumes that they fit a particular mold

563
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,000
or they fit into your existing culture

564
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,880
which isn't

565
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,880
necessarily what you want right you want

566
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,480
difference you want diversity of thought

567
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,440
you want someone that's going to

568
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,400
challenge you

569
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,000
um you don't want them to be carbon

570
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,840
copies of the rest of your team

571
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,320
so just a little takeaway there again to

572
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,080
all of the audience today regardless of

573
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,440
your role or your contract

574
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,679
context instead of saying fit like oh

575
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:34,960
that person's not a good fit or that

576
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,160
person is a good fit

577
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,679
think about them as an addition to your

578
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,520
team how would they complement your

579
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,960
existing team or how do they add

580
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,160
something that's

581
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,000
maybe even in contradiction of your team

582
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,160
like something that that is an opposing

583
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,280
um opinion right so so i challenge you

584
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,799
to think about that um

585
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,919
just an aside but

586
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,919
so with hiring we have to look at our

587
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,840
language our language matters um there's

588
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,120
a gender decoder here

589
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,720
um that you can see the link to here

590
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,160
check it out there's lots of different

591
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,600
types of decoders that can look through

592
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,559
your language or your

593
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,400
job descriptions this just happens to be

594
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,840
one we use specifically again

595
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,360
acknowledging one dimension of diversity

596
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,160
for gender

597
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,360
there are others out there someone

598
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,559
recently told me there's others out

599
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,400
there you can actually purchase

600
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,799
um that will actually look for racial

601
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:19,440
language

602
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,760
as well in your job descriptions these

603
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,559
words matter

604
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,360
um they matter a lot and what we see is

605
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,400
um

606
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,080
this was kind of a surprise to us so

607
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,840
when we use these gender decoders on

608
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,799
some very simple

609
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,400
job descriptions our job descriptions

610
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,840
are pretty short and succinct and we try

611
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,120
to keep them open because as

612
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,960
startups you're really focused on

613
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,720
product market fit you're focused on

614
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,919
generating revenue

615
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,280
um but

616
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,679
you know you don't want to pigeonhole

617
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:46,960
someone in a role when you're pulling

618
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,840
them in because

619
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,200
you know that when you're inviting them

620
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,960
as a startup specifically

621
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,480
um their role could shift right so we

622
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,919
keep our job descriptions pretty light

623
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,679
and what really was surprising was even

624
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,360
though they were light they were riddled

625
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,640
with masculine language

626
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,720
our language um especially here in the

627
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,280
us i think is primarily leads

628
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,640
mass with masculinity um and so

629
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,720
we went through this and we actually saw

630
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,720
direct results um so this works

631
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,400
um and i've had other people also try

632
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,000
this in their organization and strip

633
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,720
some

634
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,720
what was masculine language and they did

635
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,080
see more women apply

636
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,799
to roles so there's there's proven

637
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,400
results um

638
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,159
that i've seen directly and i have heard

639
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,240
anecdotally but definitely check that

640
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,039
out because it does matter

641
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,720
so that will help you invite them in and

642
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,400
so the other thing that we do here is we

643
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:34,880
use

644
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,039
something sort of our own definition of

645
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:37,919
the rooney rule

646
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,280
so i recommend you checking out the

647
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,720
rooney rule but really what what it

648
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,159
comes down to is making sure that when

649
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,600
you get to the second stage of

650
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,400
interviewing

651
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,960
as you're hiring going into that process

652
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,440
that you're

653
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,960
about 50 diverse and so

654
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,440
again that's based on qualifications and

655
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,320
diversity

656
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,760
so that might mean that maybe there's

657
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,440
what you might have perceived in the

658
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,159
first round

659
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:59,440
a little bit of a less qualified

660
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,039
candidate compared to someone else but

661
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,480
you've kept them because you're giving

662
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,919
them more of a chance

663
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,720
to establish who they are their identity

664
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,240
as well as maybe some things that might

665
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,159
surprise you and i'll tell you that

666
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,640
again through their studies but our own

667
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,159
experience as well

668
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,520
that who you end up hiring

669
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,200
can sometimes be those people that you

670
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,880
would have not necessarily pulled

671
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,280
through

672
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,960
had you not been really intentional

673
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,720
about doing this so being intentional

674
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,600
matters

675
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,480
um a lot of times i think it's like the

676
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,440
it's about

677
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,720
maybe 58 of the time the people that

678
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,559
you've kept in that second round

679
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,640
that end represent some dimension of

680
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,080
diversity and that's why you've kept

681
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,600
them in there um because they did have

682
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,120
qualifications but you also wanted to

683
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,320
ensure you had a diverse pool of

684
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,039
candidates

685
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,159
those are the people that you end up

686
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,280
hiring because they end up being the

687
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,720
best candidates

688
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,880
so again it may surprise you a little

689
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,720
bit to learn but if you have if you are

690
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,240
intentional about that the outcomes are

691
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,400
great um and the benefits are huge right

692
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,240
so there's huge benefits

693
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,960
um to doing that and then dialing back

694
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,960
you apply the same hiring practice to

695
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,480
leadership like i mentioned

696
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,159
but intentionally not tokenized um and

697
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,400
it's sad to say because startups again

698
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,919
specifically dialing it back to

699
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,320
to our experience um with startups they

700
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,840
are so focused on product market fit and

701
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,880
generating revenue

702
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,000
for obvious reasons only about 26 of

703
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,880
them actually make

704
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,480
deliberate efforts to diversify

705
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,320
leadership

706
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,640
so and that again where should you start

707
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,240
you've got to start at the top so

708
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,600
if you don't make aren't making a

709
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,039
deliberate effort that's kind of a small

710
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,559
percentage so we're trying to change

711
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,400
that um our goal is to try to change

712
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,520
that so that

713
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,000
we see more and more i mean ultimately

714
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,960
right the the

715
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,960
nirvana would be 100 but we want to see

716
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,320
more and more startups

717
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,080
really taking intentional and deliberate

718
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,480
efforts to diversify leadership because

719
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,960
then

720
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,080
it naturally um transcends to the

721
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,520
direction of the company but again like

722
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,679
the rest of the hiring and

723
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,640
growth for the company so huge benefits

724
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,760
there so check out

725
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,760
decoders in general this one is the one

726
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,520
we use for example but i know there are

727
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,520
others out there

728
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,440
it's really worthwhile and it's such an

729
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,799
easy thing to do

730
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,640
um it takes such minimal effort and it

731
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,000
has a huge impact

732
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,120
on how you're presenting who you are and

733
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,720
what you're looking for to the outside

734
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,080
world when you're trying to recruit

735
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,320
people um so that you don't

736
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,760
lose people at the door and not even

737
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,360
realize right you they dropped off when

738
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,400
they read your

739
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,720
your job ad and you didn't even know so

740
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,240
that's that's what we're trying to avoid

741
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:24,799
here

742
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,880
um but you can't stop at the hiring

743
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,320
practice you know you can't stop i

744
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,240
mentioned earlier

745
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,799
inclusive companies are 1.7 more likely

746
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,200
to be innovative leaders in their market

747
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,240
i mean that's again that's not a small

748
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,480
amount that's almost two times more

749
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,000
likely to be an innovative leader so

750
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,440
that what is that saying that's saying

751
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,080
that

752
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,840
and again you heard me say inclusive

753
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,840
companies right you didn't hear me say

754
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,480
diverse teams you didn't hear me say um

755
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,600
companies

756
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,679
like the 26 that make a deliberate

757
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,000
effort to to recruit

758
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,400
that's not um what i'm talking about

759
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,159
here because i think we often

760
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,320
invite people in but then we don't

761
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,000
create an environment

762
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,840
that makes them feel welcome or that

763
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,200
they belong so that

764
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,400
what is the challenge there the

765
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,480
challenges that

766
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,520
they will leave um so you know i talk a

767
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,360
lot about user adoption which is really

768
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,960
a tight parallel to

769
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,480
you know recruiting and inclusion and

770
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,440
diversity and part of that is adoption

771
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,120
so like the recruiting aspect like

772
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,480
getting people in

773
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,799
the door takes intentional effort it

774
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,240
takes a focus

775
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,880
but if you don't maintain that focus

776
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,400
throughout the entire journey

777
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,400
right then you lose the retention side

778
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,760
of things which means

779
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,240
people will leave because they won't

780
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,360
feel comfortable

781
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,440
they won't feel challenged they won't

782
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,559
feel like

783
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,440
they're being heard they won't feel as

784
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,039
though their opinion matters

785
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,039
you know especially with again back to

786
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,360
age as a dimension of diversity

787
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,279
a lot of startups are made up of younger

788
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,799
people that's you know that's a bit of a

789
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,000
stereotype that i'm throwing out there

790
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,600
but it also has data behind it

791
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,840
um part why is that this is an

792
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,679
interesting fact um

793
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,799
because the older we get the less risk

794
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:05,360
tolerant

795
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,039
a lot of us are again that's quite a

796
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,799
stereotype but i think also true and i

797
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:09,760
represent that

798
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,200
in the less risk tolerant you are the

799
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,400
less likely you're going to join a

800
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,919
startup because there's a lot of risk

801
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:14,640
right so

802
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,799
there's some uncertainty and unknowns so

803
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,039
joining a startup later in life

804
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,320
can represent risk that maybe you don't

805
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,000
want to take on because you have an

806
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,360
established family et cetera et cetera

807
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,120
so that means that some of the people in

808
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,799
the team are younger and just that you

809
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,240
know the next generation of people like

810
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,600
they really want to be part of something

811
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,559
that transcends them

812
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:35,840
they really want to leave their mark on

813
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,760
society um

814
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,919
and so if you're not inviting them to

815
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:40,960
the table and then

816
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,720
engaging with them and listening to

817
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,640
their opinion you don't have to agree

818
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,120
with it

819
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,480
right you don't have to like take

820
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,320
everything that your entire team is

821
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,279
saying

822
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,000
and act on it explicitly and and do what

823
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,559
they're saying

824
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,120
but but you do have to listen and you do

825
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,400
have to hear them and you do have to

826
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,919
invite people to have a voice

827
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,679
so i like to say be curious and invite

828
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,279
challenge what am i saying there i'm

829
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,679
saying like part of inclusion

830
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,080
it represents all of us just making sure

831
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,880
that people

832
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,640
have an opportunity to share their

833
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,120
opinion to be able to say

834
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,960
um you know susie i haven't heard you

835
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,559
talk in this meeting

836
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,320
what's your what do you think what are

837
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,679
your thoughts on this topic

838
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,840
you know it's it's in inviting diverse

839
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,840
perspectives

840
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,559
and it's hard um you know i've told you

841
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,400
a lot of the benefits i've thrown some

842
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,279
figures up there

843
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,279
you know there's another one around um

844
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,559
diverse teams

845
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,200
have 35 percent better performance than

846
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,039
non-diverse teams and that could be

847
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,039
both that gender and race um that's

848
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,960
where we measure obviously primarily a

849
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,960
lot of our stats come from

850
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,279
um so there's so much data so you might

851
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,039
be saying well why wouldn't people just

852
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,960
do this well so this is crazy it clearly

853
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,000
has business

854
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,720
impacts it shows better revenue better

855
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,400
return on investment for for people

856
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,320
investing in smaller companies

857
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,960
better performance you know what there's

858
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,880
so much upside why wouldn't people be

859
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,279
more

860
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,120
intentional about this um well part of

861
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,799
it is like i mentioned because

862
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,480
once you're well established it becomes

863
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,159
even more difficult to

864
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,240
introduce diversity and try to diversify

865
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,320
your team um

866
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,640
but also because it is just harder so

867
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,320
from a leadership perspective and i can

868
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,039
speak to some

869
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,039
leading teams you know for for several

870
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,600
years of different sizes and different

871
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,960
dimensions of diversity it is much

872
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,600
harder to lead a team of diverse

873
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,880
individuals

874
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,679
all the different dimensions included

875
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,279
than to lead a homogeneous team of

876
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:31,679
people

877
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,320
um why why is that harder as a manager

878
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,919
to do that

879
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,440
because there's a lot more challenge and

880
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,360
conflict now i'm telling you invite

881
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,320
challenge so i'm

882
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,000
obviously not shying away from challenge

883
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,840
here and we'll get into why that is

884
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,039
but it's harder so people don't like to

885
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,559
do those things that are hard we like to

886
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,200
represent and um surround ourselves with

887
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,200
people that are like us

888
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,640
because being comfortable is where we

889
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,120
as humans want to be um so we gravitate

890
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,880
towards that that comfort and

891
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,080
surrounding ourselves with people that

892
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,039
agree with us i once had

893
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,679
this interesting story i had a ceo of a

894
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:08,960
local startup here

895
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,559
a reasonable size startup at that time i

896
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,000
think there were upwards of almost 50

897
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,200
people

898
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,720
and he called me one day because he had

899
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,799
met me through you know networking at

900
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:17,600
several events

901
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,760
in all the volunteering that i was doing

902
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,360
around um tech women

903
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,399
in that space um and he was a tech

904
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:25,520
it was a tech company that he was the

905
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,360
ceo of and he said well i need your help

906
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,399
and i said oh jeez

907
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,240
you know what's wrong and he said well

908
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,640
i'm sitting around a table

909
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,360
of all my leadership team um going back

910
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,039
to the need to diversify leadership

911
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,240
right he's sitting around the table and

912
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,440
he said

913
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,120
we're having these conversations around

914
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,880
like our product road map and our

915
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,000
strategy and and

916
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
you know what we need to do next and

917
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,600
also who we need to hire to support

918
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,000
those

919
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,240
those outcomes um i said great and he's

920
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,600
like yeah but

921
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,039
we're all agreeing with each other he

922
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,320
said i'm looking around the table and

923
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,840
it's like carbon copies of myself when

924
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,120
we're all nodding

925
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,200
nobody's there's no conflict nobody's

926
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,279
challenging anybody nobody's even asking

927
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,279
you know questions to inspire discussion

928
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,520
um he said this has got to change

929
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,600
there's like nothing no creativity is

930
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,480
coming out of this

931
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,120
like we're gonna stall as a company and

932
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,480
i was like well first of all

933
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,559
congratulations because a lot of people

934
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,240
don't even recognize that

935
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,480
and um that is a huge thing right like i

936
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,840
told you defining up front

937
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,440
where the gaps are and what diversity

938
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,600
means in your context is step one so he

939
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,960
was at step one

940
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,720
um and we did help him and we

941
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,000
incorporated some of the mentoring

942
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,440
programs and things like that and he was

943
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,399
able to hire

944
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,679
female leadership and you know it's

945
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,120
they diversified their company quite a

946
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,080
bit so it's recognizing that but

947
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,600
but like he said like they were sitting

948
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,679
around a table and the leadership team

949
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,039
looks all the same and they're nodding

950
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:45,679
at each other

951
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,000
because that's what happened so um

952
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,440
someone referred to this recently in a

953
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,240
podcast i did

954
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,679
they called it groupthink and i was like

955
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,200
yeah that's perfect that's exactly what

956
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,520
it is right it's that phenomenon of when

957
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,000
people all share the same opinion around

958
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,399
a table and they're having discussion

959
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:01,919
one person says something and then the

960
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,200
next person agrees and then it's sort of

961
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:03,679
like a

962
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,399
domino effect and everyone's agreeing

963
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:07,919
what i want to tell you is that

964
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,000
not no great innovation comes from that

965
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,600
um great innovation comes from

966
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,399
disruption

967
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,240
um and disruption comes from challenge

968
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,600
and conflict

969
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,480
so we have to have opposing opinions we

970
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,760
have to disagree

971
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,080
um to get to the right outcome because

972
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,760
my idea is definitely not going to be

973
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,279
the best or the most

974
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,279
innovative idea in the room but gosh a

975
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,720
combination of diverse

976
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,120
perspectives can certainly elicit such

977
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,799
an amazing idea right like a much better

978
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,000
product comes out of that um

979
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,480
then if it's just a bunch of people

980
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,760
around the table that look like each

981
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,799
other um i

982
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,240
sort of really reject

983
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,200
the term like-minded um because of that

984
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,240
exact fact

985
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,840
when i think of like-minded i think of

986
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,520
that homogeneous group of people just

987
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,200
nodding at each other and agreeing

988
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,039
and nothing great coming out of that so

989
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,640
it is hard right that's that's why

990
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,760
people don't do it

991
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,640
um that's why there is such a lack of

992
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,360
diversity

993
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,320
at the top that's why industries such as

994
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,200
tech but it's

995
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,559
it's you know spans multiple industries

996
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,679
lack diversity um it's because it's hard

997
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,159
it's hard to incorporate it's hard to do

998
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,039
if you don't start

999
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:21,120
on day one so there are disadvantages

1000
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,799
and those are the disadvantages right it

1001
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,399
just makes it harder um on the

1002
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:25,519
day-to-day

1003
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,799
because you will experience that

1004
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,799
challenge but i i thrive in that

1005
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,320
environment and i recommend that you

1006
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:30,880
start to

1007
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,039
embrace it um so think about the last

1008
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,399
time you were really uncomfortable and

1009
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:35,840
ask yourself why

1010
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,679
you know and those types of things be

1011
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,120
really really curious and

1012
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,480
always be open to other people's opinion

1013
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,720
so that you might change your own

1014
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,240
perspective and that's what when we say

1015
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,000
you know diversify thinking clearly is

1016
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,360
all about diversity of thought

1017
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,039
and so we're always trying to inspire

1018
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,720
people to think differently

1019
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,399
um because when you think differently

1020
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:55,840
what's the next thing that logically

1021
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,200
happens you act differently

1022
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,480
so definitely like there's a lot of

1023
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,080
benefits of doing this but it doesn't

1024
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,200
you don't have to be in a leadership

1025
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:03,679
role

1026
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,279
like that's again i can't say that

1027
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,039
enough um you can be curious and invite

1028
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,080
challenge from any seat

1029
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,399
at the table it's really just as simple

1030
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:11,679
as looking around the room and making

1031
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,519
sure everybody's being represented

1032
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,919
are you getting feedback from everybody

1033
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,679
in the conversation and think about the

1034
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,200
last meeting you were in

1035
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,240
even you know now that we've been remote

1036
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,200
first um through the pandemic think

1037
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,880
about the last zoom you were on and

1038
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,720
the faces you saw how many people stayed

1039
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,799
muted and didn't talk or maybe you

1040
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,000
weren't even on camera

1041
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,480
right so start to be more aware of those

1042
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,519
things and invite

1043
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,279
people in invite people to the

1044
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,200
conversation because

1045
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,120
people that want to work in that diverse

1046
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,559
environment

1047
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,399
are going to want this to stay in that

1048
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,000
diverse environment and so you will you

1049
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,799
may get

1050
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,519
that sort of recruiting adoption phase

1051
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,120
but you won't get retention and that's

1052
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,559
what inclusion is all about and that's

1053
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:53,840
why i want to

1054
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,840
invite you to invite challenge and

1055
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,760
really stay in that place of curiosity

1056
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,120
long enough so that people feel like

1057
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,720
they're part of it

1058
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,120
and then you know now you've defined it

1059
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,320
you understand you need to start

1060
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,760
immediately

1061
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,360
you know that you know you've got to

1062
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,120
start at the top you have to diversify

1063
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,440
leadership only 26 percent of

1064
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,960
uh startups today are making a

1065
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,440
deliberate effort to do that don't

1066
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,919
you know be like them make sure that you

1067
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,760
focus on it more

1068
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,760
but know where you are so how do you

1069
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,120
define diversity remember i said you

1070
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,640
need to understand your gaps so where

1071
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,799
are you today be real about that how

1072
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,640
diverse are you based on your definition

1073
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,000
of diversity

1074
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
write it down i can't stress it enough

1075
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,919
writing it down gives you the power

1076
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,600
to change it because now you're holding

1077
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,200
yourself accountable accountability is

1078
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,799
all part of this as well

1079
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:41,120
make it part of your plan start to pay

1080
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,120
attention of trends in your business

1081
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,840
and i mean that across your team so what

1082
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,399
do i mean

1083
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,919
like think about the last five people

1084
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,000
you hired do they match that

1085
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,080
diversity definition that you wrote down

1086
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,919
in step one

1087
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,679
or are you even paying attention to that

1088
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,039
in your hiring practices

1089
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,320
you know it's going to highlight where

1090
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,720
you have work to do pay attention to the

1091
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,440
last

1092
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,159
five people 10 people that you promoted

1093
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:05,600
how diverse were they

1094
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,120
you know where did they come from what

1095
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,960
was their background

1096
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,800
pay attention to the last 10 people that

1097
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,879
left that this is a really important one

1098
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,960
right it's back to the inclusion side

1099
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,199
how welcome did they feel did they feel

1100
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,879
like they belonged in your company and

1101
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,760
your team whatever your context is

1102
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,918
and so were there was there a pattern to

1103
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,280
the last five people that left your

1104
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,399
company

1105
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,239
and what was that pattern and what can

1106
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,000
you do to change it that's what's going

1107
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,040
to highlight

1108
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,639
you know and some of these are hard

1109
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,320
again they're hard truths to look at on

1110
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,599
paper

1111
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:36,800
because you may have to admit things

1112
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,359
aren't working uh

1113
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,760
but i promise you if you spend the time

1114
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,800
doing that the

1115
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,918
there is a liquid benefit

1116
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,480
there is revenue and operational cost

1117
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,000
benefit on the other side of that losing

1118
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,879
people is hard

1119
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,079
so you don't want to have people leave

1120
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,839
because it's it's expensive to hire

1121
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:57,920
people right so pay attention to that

1122
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,640
watch for those trends and then you know

1123
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,520
like just to

1124
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,359
to go over you know real quick again

1125
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,800
like define it i think i've

1126
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,240
been super clear like make sure it's

1127
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,400
really clear and you write it down

1128
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,000
start now so that you don't accrue that

1129
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,839
diversity debt because the more debt you

1130
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:12,240
have

1131
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,000
we all know it's hard to go back and

1132
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,520
clean that up um

1133
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,040
think about technical debt in your mind

1134
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,400
if you ever have doubts and if you've

1135
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,839
ever experienced that you know what i'm

1136
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:21,440
saying is true

1137
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,920
start at the top this this makes a big

1138
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,520
difference it sets the tone for the

1139
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,480
future of your

1140
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,560
your company the future of your hiring

1141
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,520
practices

1142
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,760
what your customers see are you

1143
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,520
relatable to a wider market it could

1144
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,720
impact your business

1145
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,640
like what market is attracted to you

1146
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,640
what customers are you attracting

1147
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,560
um start with hiring but don't stop

1148
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,000
there make sure that you're inviting

1149
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,440
people to challenge you

1150
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,920
um i once told a leader that was moving

1151
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,359
on from my organization he said what

1152
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:48,560
advice do you have for me which i

1153
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,160
thought was such an amazing question for

1154
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,480
him to ask at like a c-level

1155
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,880
position at the time and i said surround

1156
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,320
yourself with people that disagree with

1157
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:56,880
you

1158
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,760
because he was such a bold and like firm

1159
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,800
speaker

1160
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,480
that i found people agreed with him a

1161
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,000
lot because they were a bit intimidated

1162
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,720
by him and so i recommended that he

1163
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,400
surround people that disagree with him

1164
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,920
so that he would have that challenge and

1165
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,280
that diversity of thought

1166
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,200
and then finally know your stats like

1167
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,880
write those things down

1168
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,280
know where you're starting from along

1169
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,720
with the definition of diversity so you

1170
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,240
can identify the gaps and you'll know

1171
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,839
when you've made improvements or

1172
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:23,200
when things are falling behind and you

1173
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,119
need to make adjustments but you won't

1174
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,640
know if you don't track those things

1175
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,079
so you need to measure those things so

1176
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,320
that they they change and then

1177
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,720
finally again melissa turquoise um

1178
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,480
always happy to have conversations about

1179
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,680
diversity and

1180
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,400
technology um feel free to take a snap

1181
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,280
on my link tree

1182
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,960
find me at all the different places

1183
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,400
social and otherwise and

1184
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,160
this was a pleasure and i hope everybody

1185
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,320
had at least one great takeaway

1186
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,079
to think differently after today

1187
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,480
thank you so much melissa so interesting

1188
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,440
we have a question here from them from

1189
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,800
constanza

1190
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,000
she's asking how to deal with

1191
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,280
microaggressions

1192
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,400
male 7 in the work environment when as

1193
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,839
women it's not our job to educate men

1194
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,240
um that's such a great question and i

1195
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,000
love i love the addition

1196
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,320
of that she added of as women it's not

1197
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,160
our responsibility to educate men

1198
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,440
i'm actually going to challenge you

1199
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,880
because of course here i am talking

1200
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,320
about inviting challenge but

1201
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,680
i'm going to challenge you that i think

1202
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,359
it is partly our responsibility to

1203
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:28,400
educate men

1204
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,000
um so and i know i know some of the

1205
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,599
the things that can happen and in some

1206
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,200
cases i'll always differ and say you

1207
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,160
should bring

1208
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,000
if you have any sort of hr i know in

1209
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,760
startups specifically sometimes we don't

1210
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,599
um so that can be tough but if you do

1211
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:42,800
have hr

1212
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,440
definitely regroup and bring them into

1213
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,640
the conversation

1214
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,119
if you don't in either way you

1215
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,000
definitely i do

1216
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,280
believe it is our responsibility to

1217
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,200
educate madness so you may not like that

1218
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:53,839
answer

1219
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,520
um but i'll tell you because what i

1220
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,440
found more often than not is they don't

1221
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:57,920
even

1222
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,720
realize that what they're doing is

1223
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,000
having the impact on us

1224
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,599
that it is um and

1225
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,520
you know i have so many examples i'm

1226
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,720
trying to think of a quick one but i

1227
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,560
have so many examples of where i've

1228
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,200
i've brought it to the attention of male

1229
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:13,680
leaders

1230
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,000
in in my organization when there's been

1231
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,200
a certain scenario like

1232
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,839
leaving me out of conversations right

1233
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,280
conversations where i should definitely

1234
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:21,599
be

1235
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,599
in right like if my role is related to

1236
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:24,800
customers and you're having a direct

1237
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,160
conversation with customers

1238
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,200
and you're not bringing into the

1239
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,480
conversation or you're kind of going

1240
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,440
around me

1241
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,920
to me that's sort of like implying that

1242
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,880
i'm not

1243
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,440
doing my job or i can't handle it

1244
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,119
because that person's a male and you're

1245
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,240
a male and you're just going to take

1246
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,920
care of it like very boys club that's

1247
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,520
kind of a thing we say here in the u.s

1248
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,160
right

1249
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,440
um but but now

1250
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,720
i could look at that and say it's not my

1251
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,560
responsibility to

1252
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,240
educate him that he shouldn't have done

1253
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,839
that but i actually took the whole other

1254
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,359
role where i sat down with him and said

1255
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,680
listen when you do this

1256
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,640
this is how this makes me feel and this

1257
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,280
is

1258
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,359
honestly this is a systemic problem that

1259
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,119
i've been dealing with for 25 years in

1260
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,160
my career

1261
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,640
and i believe like i still i have this

1262
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,640
spring phrase i say assume good intent

1263
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,920
that doesn't mean that everyone has good

1264
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,200
intent by the way but i like to

1265
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,520
lead with assuming it and so i said i'm

1266
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,440
assuming that that is not

1267
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,599
that was not your intent was to make me

1268
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,760
feel as though i wasn't doing my job

1269
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,200
or that i couldn't handle it because i

1270
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,720
was a woman and that you were going to

1271
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,680
take care of it

1272
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,440
but when you know he thought he was just

1273
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,800
doing me a favor and he said you're

1274
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,079
doing me a favor is

1275
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,040
actually undermining my authority so i

1276
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,480
need you to bring me into those

1277
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,640
conversations like um is this my role

1278
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,599
yes it's your role

1279
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:36,800
okay great then you need to bring me

1280
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,640
into those conversations you can't

1281
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,320
go out and around me so that's an

1282
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,240
example again i have lots of examples

1283
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:42,960
that's one that's

1284
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,440
sort of fresh in my mind so i would say

1285
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,800
i kind of feel like it was my

1286
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,160
responsibility because i don't think

1287
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,040
that he really

1288
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,520
intentionally was doing something that

1289
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,599
was a form of like microaggression

1290
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,000
against

1291
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,760
myself as a female leader but it

1292
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,359
certainly felt i mean i was furious

1293
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,359
so i certainly felt that way right like

1294
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:00,400
i felt

1295
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,400
really offended and there's been moments

1296
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,440
like that or

1297
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,599
another example is i was on a call again

1298
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:06,640
with customers

1299
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,400
and i find myself being the only female

1300
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,160
in the room quite often right like both

1301
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:10,640
on the

1302
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,920
because we work with tech companies

1303
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,839
we're a tech company so

1304
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:16,960
it's the reality of of my role um

1305
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,640
and someone one of them one of the men

1306
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,000
said something that was i believe

1307
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,599
somewhat inappropriate i would say i

1308
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,440
don't believe it was a very professional

1309
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,000
uh

1310
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,440
adjective let's just put it that way um

1311
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,720
in response to something that he said

1312
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,920
my ceo reiterated that same word back

1313
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,560
now he didn't know that that was like

1314
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,000
really offensive i was the only

1315
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,680
woman on the call i followed up with him

1316
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,960
after i said hey i just want you to know

1317
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,920
i want to talk to you about something

1318
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,520
that happened on that call like

1319
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,920
that was not cool like that he said that

1320
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,359
was not cool but the fact that you said

1321
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,119
it back to him in response to something

1322
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,640
like you were agreeing with him

1323
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,960
was even worse and he was like oh i

1324
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,480
didn't take it like that i took it like

1325
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,920
and he said this whole thing i go yeah

1326
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,800
just so you know

1327
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,960
as a woman in that room there was no

1328
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,319
other way to take that

1329
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:02,640
like even like there was just no other

1330
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,319
way to interpret that it was completely

1331
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:05,599
inappropriate and

1332
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:07,440
like i need you to be aware of those

1333
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,960
things i don't need you to call the guy

1334
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,319
out like we don't need to embarrass

1335
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:11,440
people

1336
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,720
you know whether it was intentional or

1337
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,400
not on his side but i definitely don't

1338
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,520
need you to like

1339
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,640
validate it by repeating it so again

1340
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,359
like

1341
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,920
maybe not the right answer for you or or

1342
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,520
what you wanted to hear but i would say

1343
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,040
you know we have a responsibility

1344
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,720
um and in so the gender

1345
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,040
diversity dimension that i represent in

1346
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,280
technology i have a responsibility

1347
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,680
so that other women don't feel the same

1348
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,800
aggressions or

1349
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,359
you know inappropriateness in the future

1350
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:40,480
right and so

1351
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,720
i'm not going to fix a systemic problem

1352
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,400
but i can certainly do my part in my

1353
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,599
context and so

1354
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,440
i guess i'm challenging you to say you

1355
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,280
you do have your responsibility

1356
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,280
um to speak up because we can't assume

1357
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,720
that they know that they're

1358
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,079
doing something that's inappropriate

1359
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,720
it's a it is like a societal bias and i

1360
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,839
don't think

1361
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:59,440
we can hold every individual accountable

1362
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,040
and say they're a bad person

1363
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,160
because they did that now that's not to

1364
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,280
say there aren't some people that are

1365
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,480
very intentionally

1366
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,480
inappropriate but i think we should

1367
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,000
assume good intent and try

1368
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,319
our best to do our part and then

1369
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,319
ultimately if it's within your workplace

1370
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,400
and you can't you don't have hr or

1371
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,440
they're not helping and

1372
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,480
you know i think that's a whole nother

1373
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,839
conversation where it's probably not the

1374
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,119
right environment for you but

1375
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,280
um that would be a little bit of

1376
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,880
challenge in that advice or answer to

1377
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,560
your question

1378
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,079
well i think it was a great question

1379
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,640
she's not clapping her hands here in a

1380
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,079
chat so she's very happy with your

1381
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:31,680
answer great um

1382
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,680
i think it comes a little bit back to we

1383
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,720
talked to the

1384
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,280
to the speaker before you i think

1385
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:37,920
sometimes

1386
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,240
men we think so differently men and

1387
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,839
women and sometimes

1388
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:43,440
i see it with my husband i've known him

1389
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,200
for almost 20 years

1390
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,800
and still don't understand each other

1391
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,119
always yeah i think so differently and

1392
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:49,760
from

1393
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,040
completely different angles so sometimes

1394
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,960
something that's totally logical for me

1395
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,520
it's not logical for him another man

1396
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,560
perhaps

1397
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,160
and they say things that they have no

1398
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,160
ideas offensive so i think you're right

1399
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,680
that

1400
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,760
we have to educate somehow or at least

1401
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,520
open our mouth and say you know what

1402
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,520
i didn't like the way you said that yeah

1403
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,440
just think about how you speak or what

1404
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,640
you say

1405
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,760
and this was not fun for me um

1406
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,359
i think it's um but we don't want to be

1407
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:21,440
you know we don't want to be hysterical

1408
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,440
as women so maybe sometimes we don't

1409
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,680
really say it when we get offended

1410
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,920
because we don't want them to to see us

1411
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,680
as hysterical perhaps

1412
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,720
the other thing we could think

1413
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,200
yeah so i think it's it's the point in

1414
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,960
this very male dominated

1415
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,040
area of work i think it's important that

1416
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:45,359
women know how to actually react

1417
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,680
maybe some good advice is how do i react

1418
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,440
if i'm in this situation and this guy

1419
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,680
says something in front of 20 other guys

1420
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,680
and i feel really offended

1421
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,480
how could i react in that situation not

1422
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:56,960
to be

1423
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,480
the cry girl you know what would be

1424
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,960
like a good reaction if i feel really

1425
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,880
offended or that you know

1426
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,680
i mean they maybe even here in latin

1427
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,079
america

1428
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,960
it's a white male chauvinistic still so

1429
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,720
they might either comment maybe your

1430
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,280
clothes

1431
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,200
or your or your look how do you

1432
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,960
confront that if you feel really

1433
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,720
uncomfortable and how do you sort of

1434
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,119
draw the limit so you know i'm also a

1435
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:24,480
person i'm a woman yeah

1436
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,960
outside this uh office i'm a woman and

1437
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,400
we can be friends and

1438
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,640
you can flirt with me perhaps but not in

1439
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,480
the meeting room perhaps you know

1440
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,160
how do you create that limit um

1441
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,280
[Music]

1442
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,760
in order to be respected and not suits

1443
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,720
them to think that you're just

1444
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,400
hysterical and

1445
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,720
i don't know whatever yeah yeah we do i

1446
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,160
mean there's a

1447
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,280
you know there's a lot of mental

1448
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,960
gymnastics that we go through it's what

1449
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,079
i like to call it um

1450
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:52,079
and i actually heard a man on a panel

1451
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:53,599
once and so it was really enlightening

1452
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,040
for me right i think it's

1453
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,640
i'm all about like understand and be

1454
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,240
understood because you're right like we

1455
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,920
don't we have such different

1456
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,640
ways of thinking men and women um and i

1457
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,079
agree with what you were saying like

1458
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,599
even with your husband that you've been

1459
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:06,720
with right like there's just certain

1460
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,280
you're like

1461
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,560
that's what you would have thought like

1462
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,319
how could you have thought that but it

1463
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,720
but i think you know i that's the great

1464
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,839
thing right like that's what brings

1465
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:16,400
people together is the differences so

1466
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,000
you know this this man on this panel

1467
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,160
said he said it's a struggle to be

1468
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,920
and i was like what it's a struggle for

1469
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,440
you as a man of technology sure

1470
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,960
right like you're in a leadership role

1471
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,640
like boohoo like i don't feel bad for

1472
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,040
you

1473
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,640
but you know what he said was really

1474
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,720
enlightening to me any and it challenged

1475
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,000
me to think differently about what they

1476
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,520
go through as well like he's like you

1477
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,520
know a woman walks in a room

1478
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,560
and you know there's not any the chairs

1479
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,040
are full

1480
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,440
do i get up and give her my chair

1481
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,119
because is she gonna get offended

1482
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:44,960
like oh i'm a woman so you have to get

1483
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,160
up and get my chair would you have done

1484
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,440
that if a guy walked in

1485
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,040
he's like or am i being offensive

1486
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,720
because i don't give her up give her my

1487
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,280
chair

1488
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,359
do i hold the door for her do i not hold

1489
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:54,319
the door for her

1490
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,960
and so i said am i to myself oh my

1491
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,480
goodness they are going kind of through

1492
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,480
these mental gymnastics too similar to

1493
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,800
us like why would someone just say that

1494
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,160
they wouldn't have said that if i was a

1495
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,560
guy like so we're all going through this

1496
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,800
and so sometimes it's like wow maybe the

1497
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,280
easiest thing would be just to ask

1498
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,319
just to ask you know um so in that sense

1499
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:15,839
to him it's like maybe he should just

1500
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,440
say would you like a chair like it's

1501
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,200
just polite right it's not even about

1502
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,040
men or women and maybe you just ask a

1503
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,720
guy that too like when he walks in the

1504
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:23,280
room

1505
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,280
would you like a chair i'm happy to get

1506
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,880
up if you would prefer to sit you know

1507
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,200
and just kind of treating people just

1508
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,000
well

1509
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,599
politely um but to that point i've

1510
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,400
have experienced my fair share of like

1511
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,240
strange comments that

1512
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,880
i know wouldn't have been said if i was

1513
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:41,520
male

1514
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,599
in the room and like weird things i even

1515
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:44,880
had someone

1516
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,200
i worked for for a company that would

1517
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,000
you know their

1518
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,960
headquartered was in france and so one

1519
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,160
of my french colleagues i was in a

1520
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:52,720
meeting

1521
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,839
full of men all around the table in a

1522
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:56,400
boardroom and

1523
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,520
i was the only female and he

1524
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,640
wanted to do introductions um and so he

1525
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,839
he said let's start with the woman

1526
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:08,640
and i was like why would you not why

1527
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,520
would you say that

1528
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,880
and then i had to like again kind of

1529
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,240
give him the benefit of that and be like

1530
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,680
okay he's being polite

1531
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,880
but it was like really

1532
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,800
like could you could you have not said

1533
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,240
let's start with melissa or

1534
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,240
like um let's start at this end of the

1535
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,079
table but let's start with the woman

1536
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:27,119
and it was just really awkward um so

1537
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:29,119
it definitely happens and in that case i

1538
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:30,720
didn't call him out for it so i think

1539
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,960
it really does depend i think there's

1540
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,400
there's some aspects of

1541
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,400
if you call them out are you acting too

1542
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,000
feminist like am i standing up on the

1543
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,520
table and burning my bra in front of

1544
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,200
everybody and everyone's like oh geez

1545
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,040
be careful with her she's really

1546
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,880
emotional and you kind of draw too much

1547
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,720
attention to yourself that way and it's

1548
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,800
it stinks because we we go through that

1549
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,839
in our head

1550
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:51,440
um we want to be taken seriously we want

1551
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,040
to be respected we want to be seen as

1552
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,480
like strong and mature

1553
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,599
but we are women and we should also be

1554
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:00,000
proud of that and we should be able to

1555
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,760
wear a very pretty dress and not have

1556
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,079
someone make some sort of slang comment

1557
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:05,760
to us and we walk in the room and you

1558
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,000
know

1559
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,240
and make us feel uncomfortable so what i

1560
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,000
found in my own experience and this has

1561
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,079
taken years to get to this stage a lot

1562
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,440
of the times i said nothing

1563
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,839
um and i would let it kind of like eat

1564
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:18,000
away at me sort of in a resentful way

1565
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,200
um that didn't serve me so i think

1566
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,040
again i i try to lead with consume good

1567
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,640
intent when i kind of think

1568
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,400
did they actually mean that in the way

1569
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,760
that i took it or did they

1570
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,280
it's sort of an innocuous comment they

1571
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,960
didn't actually mean anything by it

1572
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,800
and i think back to that man on that

1573
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,720
panel where he's like do i pull out the

1574
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,079
chair do i hold the door i don't know

1575
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,760
what to do am i gonna offend her

1576
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,520
and i'm like maybe that's going on and

1577
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,440
they you know it's tough they're

1578
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,800
stumbling on their words they're not

1579
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,680
sure

1580
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,839
to say the wrong thing the right thing

1581
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,040
and this happens

1582
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,559
you know it's a big part of diversity

1583
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,240
and inclusion too right that people are

1584
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:50,720
really

1585
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,680
really paralyzed by their language it's

1586
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,880
it's big with race

1587
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,359
and all kinds of dimensions of diversity

1588
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:57,920
um

1589
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,000
i'm so i'm so afraid i'm gonna say the

1590
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,800
wrong thing i say nothing um

1591
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,559
and so sometimes i'm like it's okay

1592
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,160
you're gonna make mistakes

1593
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,800
it's okay and so i don't think we wanna

1594
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,480
take an approach where we

1595
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,720
crucify men for making those mistakes

1596
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:13,760
because then i think we're gonna make it

1597
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,240
worse

1598
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,640
um so but i do think if we have a good

1599
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,920
relationship with people

1600
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,520
and we should that it let's not make

1601
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,440
a spectacle of them in front of a room

1602
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,640
of other people because maybe they

1603
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,160
didn't mean to do that but maybe take

1604
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,280
them aside after

1605
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,480
right and say hey listen i know similar

1606
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,400
to what i've done you know recently with

1607
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,000
with my leadership team it's like hey

1608
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,200
listen i know that you didn't you

1609
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,720
weren't intentionally trying to make me

1610
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,160
feel uncomfortable

1611
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,079
but when you said this this is how that

1612
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,160
felt um so i just want i want to make

1613
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:42,960
you aware

1614
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,200
of how that made me feel and i would

1615
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,599
appreciate in like professional contacts

1616
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,319
that you don't you know openly voice

1617
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:50,640
your

1618
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,480
compliments about what i'm wearing today

1619
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,760
you know or something like that

1620
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,119
and just be professional about it

1621
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:56,640
instead of taking it so personally i

1622
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,000
think we do um

1623
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,599
we do take things really personally and

1624
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,040
listen i suffer from it too

1625
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,760
my first reaction is excuse me but i

1626
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,640
have to like

1627
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,280
say to myself okay assume good intent

1628
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,480
like

1629
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,319
they probably you know and we don't know

1630
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:11,760
their background either right like maybe

1631
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,280
they were raised

1632
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,880
if if a woman comes in the room and

1633
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,480
she's dressed nice you should always

1634
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,079
compliment her you don't know

1635
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:19,599
right and so like they're not trying to

1636
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,280
make everybody look at you

1637
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,400
because you're the only woman in the

1638
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,720
room but you know then i've also had

1639
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,000
stories early in my career

1640
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,599
where i had a vp during an architectural

1641
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:31,280
presentation i was giving

1642
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,280
early in my 20s comment on the color of

1643
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,359
my nail polish well that was just a

1644
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:38,400
you know inappropriate thing right yeah

1645
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,760
and so

1646
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,119
but i will say i look back on that

1647
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:42,319
moment that was one of the defining

1648
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:44,079
moments of my career as a moment where i

1649
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:45,599
didn't speak up

1650
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:47,839
you know the room got dead silent no one

1651
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:49,359
said anything i was the only woman in

1652
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:51,359
the room i was the one presenting

1653
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:54,240
it was really awkward and then i just

1654
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,760
started talking again

1655
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,920
so do you think they realized that that

1656
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,240
was out of line do you think the others

1657
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,480
sort of realized that i think i think

1658
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,760
everyone

1659
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,680
was just really uncomfortable but no one

1660
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,040
wanted to call him out

1661
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,520
i certainly was so intimidated in that

1662
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,720
moment that i didn't

1663
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,240
um but i'll never forget that moment

1664
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,599
it's crazy the things that stick with

1665
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:15,200
you i will never forget that moment how

1666
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,240
i felt

1667
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,000
the silence in the room like the whole

1668
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,359
thing um

1669
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:22,800
and i look back now and reflect on it as

1670
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,079
you know i was a confident intelligent

1671
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,480
young woman in a room full in a

1672
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,480
boardroom full of

1673
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,079
older men in in director and vp roles

1674
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:36,240
and i think i intimidated him because i

1675
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,920
was speaking about things in a technical

1676
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,680
perspective that he

1677
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,240
didn't have knowledge of and so i think

1678
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,280
in that moment

1679
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,000
again my reflection of that is he was

1680
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,040
trying to kind of like

1681
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,760
level set like okay everybody just

1682
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,880
remember she's a woman

1683
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,040
right like check out her nail polish

1684
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,400
because like we're listening to her

1685
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,280
right now but like

1686
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,440
i think he felt intimidated so so again

1687
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,160
like i get a horrible thing to do but

1688
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,079
at the same time i try to have some sort

1689
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,599
of empathy for

1690
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:10,079
what was he in that moment thinking

1691
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:12,000
you know like why would he say something

1692
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,440
like that and so i think that's the

1693
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,119
other thing going back to like

1694
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:17,200
trying to stay in that moment that place

1695
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,440
of curiosity and inquisitiveness

1696
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,880
um i didn't do this but i wish now going

1697
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,240
back that i could have took him aside

1698
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,520
after the meeting and said why would you

1699
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,200
have done that

1700
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,640
like what would have made you do

1701
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,920
something like that in the middle of me

1702
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,040
giving a professional

1703
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,680
presentation you know and like really

1704
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,359
pushed it back on him so he wouldn't

1705
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:37,040
he would think about that and never do

1706
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,400
that again you know or

1707
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,240
or understand the impact it had on me in

1708
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,839
the moment um

1709
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:43,520
of course hindsight's 20 20 but then i

1710
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,599
just try to like you know

1711
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:48,640
be more vocal now so but it is

1712
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,359
it's not easy and it will you we think

1713
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:52,400
oh we're so far

1714
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,160
progressed as a society that stuff

1715
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,680
doesn't happen now it happens

1716
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,400
it happens all the time it still happens

1717
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,000
i have another question here from tammy

1718
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,680
maybe maybe we have talked a little bit

1719
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:02,640
about it but she says

1720
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,040
in which way can we compete in this

1721
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,000
masculine

1722
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,319
um air in our area um

1723
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:13,440
oh it costs a lot

1724
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,720
to get a job and it is

1725
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,960
because yeah it costs a lot like to get

1726
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,920
a job if you're

1727
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,400
fighting from you know going against

1728
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,599
them

1729
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:25,680
the stream what you call them oh my

1730
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,440
language um

1731
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,520
like if you're going against everything

1732
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,760
they're doing it's really hard to obtain

1733
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,280
a job perhaps

1734
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,880
how do you do you have an advice for

1735
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,400
that

1736
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,720
a piece of advice for that yeah so kind

1737
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,800
of like going against the status quo so

1738
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,280
to speak

1739
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,319
and like yeah yeah yeah so

1740
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,880
yeah it's tough like i think um you

1741
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,079
don't want to assimilate

1742
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:50,800
right like you don't want to just become

1743
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,000
like everyone else

1744
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,640
to fit in like we don't want to fit we

1745
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,760
want to be a good audition we don't want

1746
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,280
to be a fit um

1747
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,119
so that's a really big question

1748
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:03,680
how how do you find it i think well you

1749
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,720
know

1750
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,559
i mean perhaps she's thinking about how

1751
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:10,079
do you escalate i mean how do you keep

1752
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:11,440
getting promoted if you

1753
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,680
kind of fight all the time against the

1754
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,720
way things are done

1755
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,040
i mean it's again this absolute thing of

1756
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,440
being respected as a professional

1757
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,839
how do you manage that situation that

1758
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:23,040
trying to educate

1759
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,720
but at the same time not wanting to be

1760
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:27,920
against everything

1761
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,559
all the time yeah that's where this

1762
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:31,760
question is going

1763
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,520
yeah no that that's fair that i think

1764
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,599
thank you for the clarification i think

1765
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:37,839
my advice is find a sponsor and when i

1766
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:38,799
say sponsor

1767
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:40,799
we often think of like someone to mentor

1768
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:42,240
us um

1769
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,480
if you can find a male sponsor like

1770
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,079
somebody that you can align with that

1771
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:47,839
you respect

1772
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:49,920
they will help you overcome a lot of

1773
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,240
these things um that that definitely was

1774
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,680
something that was huge for me in my

1775
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,359
career um

1776
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:56,640
i didn't know that's what was happening

1777
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,960
at the time but now on the other side of

1778
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,559
that i look back and i'm like oh

1779
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:02,480
she's he sponsored me for quite a bit of

1780
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,079
my career and when i say sponsor

1781
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:05,520
different than a mentor right this is a

1782
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,000
person that um is going to promote you

1783
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,280
when you're not in a room

1784
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,799
like to other people like this is the

1785
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:11,920
person that's talking about the great

1786
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,119
work that you're doing

1787
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:15,680
it's it'll it allows and let's be let's

1788
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,200
face it the majority of people in

1789
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,640
leadership roles right it's the reason

1790
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,000
why we're so passionate about this

1791
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,480
are male um they are primarily white

1792
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:23,680
males um

1793
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,160
they're even most between the ages of 50

1794
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,760
and 60 i think so

1795
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,760
like there's a specific demographic that

1796
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,079
represents a lot of the executives

1797
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,680
across industry and specifically in the

1798
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:36,240
tech industry so um

1799
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,280
you know find if you can find someone in

1800
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,960
a leadership role that you do respect

1801
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,640
that you can align with they will help

1802
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:43,200
you

1803
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,440
as far as like how do you continue to me

1804
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,200
maintain authenticity right like because

1805
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,319
you don't want to sacrifice your

1806
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:49,760
authenticity for a job

1807
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,480
like in no case um so that will never

1808
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,920
work because at some point you will be

1809
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,520
miserable if not immediately because

1810
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,960
you're not going to be true to who you

1811
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:57,680
are

1812
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,319
so it is a bit like swimming upstream i

1813
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:01,599
think that's kind of what you were

1814
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:02,880
you're going like going against the

1815
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,319
status quo stream that yeah yeah

1816
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,280
no i totally get you i think but look

1817
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,040
look for someone that will help you

1818
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,880
right like that will take you with them

1819
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,720
um and so that's that's when we refer to

1820
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:15,440
sponsors

1821
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,720
which is um it's it's a really

1822
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:19,680
interesting

1823
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,200
dynamic and a relationship that's

1824
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,640
different than a mentor because it's not

1825
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,240
just about them giving you advice

1826
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:27,359
um but it's about them really supporting

1827
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:29,280
you in your career and

1828
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,000
pushing you through pushing you up and

1829
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:32,799
elevating you

1830
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:36,079
to be promoted um and i think that

1831
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:38,079
because there are so many so many men in

1832
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:39,680
leadership roles we've got to align

1833
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:40,880
ourselves with them and i promise you

1834
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,240
there are people out there that are that

1835
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,079
want to support you but again like ask

1836
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:44,960
for help but don't

1837
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,680
don't don't assume they know you need

1838
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,079
help

1839
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:49,280
i think that's the other thing like we

1840
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,280
as women are like well why would they

1841
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,000
help us

1842
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,720
or well they're not helping us well but

1843
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,319
they don't even know well like i just

1844
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,000
like back to the first question like

1845
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,839
don't assume that they know what they're

1846
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:01,599
doing is making you feel bad don't

1847
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:03,040
assume that they know that you need help

1848
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,240
so

1849
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,799
i recommend like seek out somebody in

1850
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:08,319
your organization that you do

1851
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:10,240
have respect for that you feel

1852
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,760
comfortable having a conversation like

1853
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:12,000
that

1854
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,079
with and and talk about the things that

1855
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:15,280
you're challenged with talk about what

1856
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,720
your aspirations are

1857
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,960
and i think inevitably you will align

1858
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,240
yourself with someone that will sponsor

1859
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:20,720
you and

1860
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,559
and help lift you up while still

1861
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:24,480
maintaining like your own authenticity i

1862
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:25,599
think that's

1863
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:28,079
that's crucial otherwise you know you

1864
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:29,440
sacrifice that and you're not going to

1865
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,880
feel good about anything that happens to

1866
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,960
elevate your career

1867
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,599
the last question from from lydia what

1868
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:37,440
would be three pieces of

1869
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,559
advice to make a work plan and

1870
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:43,520
that would get us to them the goal that

1871
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,359
was um

1872
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:48,880
spoken about in this talk three

1873
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:53,440
like do you have a plan sort of how to

1874
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,440
like diversify your team like kind of

1875
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,119
like what would be the three things that

1876
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:58,079
you take away from this

1877
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:00,160
sure yeah absolutely um so i think

1878
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,760
number one is like i said

1879
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,760
probably more than you wanted to hear

1880
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,359
but like define it and write it down

1881
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:05,839
like what

1882
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:07,680
what is the most important thing from

1883
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,200
diversity because i think

1884
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,440
we as women we always think gender

1885
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,440
because it's top of mind to us

1886
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,240
but like is that what it is um so number

1887
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:16,960
one like

1888
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,880
be super crystal clear about what it is

1889
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,000
the outcome that you're trying to reach

1890
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,160
is it 50 50 gender diverse

1891
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,079
um is it that you want more women in

1892
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:26,160
leadership is it that you want more

1893
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,160
ethnicity in your organization

1894
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:31,599
what is that um number two um look at

1895
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:32,480
how

1896
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:35,760
your a

1897
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,079
how are you inviting people into your

1898
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:39,680
organization like what are you doing

1899
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,079
how do you represent your team your

1900
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:42,880
company

1901
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,400
publicly because that is gonna change

1902
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,440
who will come to you um so that's a huge

1903
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,720
thing to look at once you understand

1904
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,000
what your goals are

1905
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,440
um and then finally are you creating an

1906
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,359
environment that is truly inclusive

1907
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:59,599
and that's what i'm saying like be

1908
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:01,280
existentially curious

1909
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,079
like every single day all the time

1910
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:05,839
always asking other people's opinions

1911
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:07,839
always being open to that you do not

1912
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:08,880
have to agree with it

1913
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,640
listening to other people's perspectives

1914
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,160
does not mean that you agree with it it

1915
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,440
also doesn't mean you're going to act on

1916
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,000
it

1917
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
but i think that's that's what inclusion

1918
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,520
really means it's just

1919
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,599
inviting the opinions to the table and

1920
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:21,440
and listening

1921
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,400
allowing people to share give feedback

1922
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,040
um

1923
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,640
feel like they belong like those three

1924
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,559
things i think would be the

1925
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:31,680
the biggest takeaways from today

1926
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,599
thank you so much it's been really

1927
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:35,200
