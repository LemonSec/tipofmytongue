25
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,480
of knowledge that we as organization provide and 
also to make the certifications that we provide  

26
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:06,880
most of respected one of which is this isp worth 
the effort and continuous professional education  

27

as well within croatia i'm vice president of 
the ice association of the creation chamber of  

28
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,760
economy and also president of the cyber security 
affiliation a group of creation companies uh  

29
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:26,480
doing business in cyber security and i was also uh 
selected as one of the top 50 women of influence  

30
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:34,880
in cyber security in europe that was a great honor 
to me provided by the sc magazine uk so what i do  

31
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:42,240
all my life i'm trying to put a cyber security 
role and especially you know help my colleagues  

32
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:50,400
who are in the field get heard and understood 
at the appropriate level in organizations i know  

33
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:57,840
dealing with cyber security is not really an easy 
job and we had we had spent a lot of your years  

34
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:06,560
trying to provide the insights that are basically 
necessary in order to run the entire business  

35
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:13,520
to send this message to the right levels in 
organization and our you know first first  

36
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:21,280
level that we were actually having an ability 
co to communicate with was it chief information  

37
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:28,640
officer or so on then it was finally understood we 
have to be enlist in a parallel position with the  

38
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:35,040
chief information officers we succeeded in that 
i think we succeeded the next level was actually  

39
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:41,760
to have ci source of chief information security 
officers seen as senior people within the company  

40
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:47,920
members of the management board vice presidents 
of organizations that is something we also see now  

41
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:54,240
however i think we need to make one step forward 
we never should stop moving and you know sending  

42
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,040
our messages even to more appropriate levels 
within the organizations and this is the board  

43
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:06,320
of directors and this is my uh presentation today 
i think that the board as someone who owns the  

44
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:15,120
strategy of the organization has to have the voice 
of ci source heard at the board meetings heard  

45
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,880
when make making those decisions about the company 
about the strategy about everything they are going  

46
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:29,120
to do about cyber risks and everything those ci 
souls need in order to do their job properly uh  

47
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:36,640
recent research actually shows that we are doing 
quite well in this area uh 67 percent of the  

48
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,720
respondents indicated that the organization 
prioritize cyber security above all other business  

49
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,960
considerations which means that cyber security 
has become finally the key enabling function  

50
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:55,919
across business initiatives i'm sure you all still 
have problems when cyber security is seen as an  

51
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:01,520
obstacle and this really shouldn't be so cyber 
security should always be seen as a business  

52
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:09,280
enabler instead of an obstacle so they should be 
able to say a careful yes taking into account all  

53
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:15,840
the risks our organization is exposed to instead 
of saying a primary no no you cannot do that no  

54
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,320
this is forbidden no our security policy says 
no i don't want to talk about this so this is  

55
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:25,680
not the right way we should be business enablers 
but in order to be adequate business enablers  

56
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,680
we need to understand those risks that our 
information are exposed to and we also need  

57
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,600
to make sure the senior level of management the 
board of director understands that risk as well  

58
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:46,880
96 percent of these same uh respondents um they 
agree that business executives now have a better  

59
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,080
understanding of cyber security than they did 
five years ago that's a great improvement as well  

60
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,280
part of that better understanding 
uh many business executives  

61
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,719
do not see when you have a data breach within 
your organization it's something that is only  

62
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:12,800
ciso's fault or only cyber security teams fault 
even more they now see those people who have  

63
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,800
been through a bridge within a big organization 
any kind of organization that they have actually  

64
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:26,240
gained a really worthwhile experience and that 
experience makes them even better potential  

65
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:33,440
employees because they know how to deal with the 
bridge also which is kind of surprising to me but  

66
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,560
this is very positive 76 percent of respondents 
believe that managing cyber risk is becoming  

67
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:46,640
so important that we will see companies naming 
cisos as ceos this in my opinion it first means ci  

68
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,439
source should completely understand all business 
operations and that is no longer such you know  

69
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,480
a mistake anymore because they really how 
to understand all those business processes  

70
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,280
and everything that is happening within the 
company in order to make right decisions about how  

71
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:06,560
to treat cyber security risks so this is 
not a far away future this is happening

72
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:15,040
when we try to answer the question why all 
of this is happening um this is i'm i'm not  

73
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:24,319
really happy about but it actually helps a big 
word is still compliance we have whenever some  

74
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:32,160
compliance regulation is made and especially if 
it has huge regulatory fines everyone is elected  

75
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:38,800
everyone asks okay what do we need to do now in in 
order to avoid those fines what do we need to do  

76
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:45,439
in order to be compliant these are great questions 
to ask and i understand why companies are  

77
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:51,040
asking these questions and in most cases we help 
companies actually align with different compliance  

78
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:58,160
requirements but it will be much better if we have 
already done everything be called regardless of  

79
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:05,520
what the regulation says so that we take conscious 
approach to major risk within our business and  

80
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,240
if the regulation says you have to i don't know 
implement organizational technical measures for  

81
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,440
personal data protection well we have already done 
that and we know how to do that and we understand  

82
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:23,520
why we need to do that uh however you've seen 
gdpr in 2018 it came uh it became actually  

83
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:32,320
something that all companies who process data 
or subjects personal data or data subjects in uh  

84
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,960
in the eu how to be compliant with and you 
know defines coming out of this regulation  

85
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:45,040
20 million euros so four percent of the global 
annual revenue these are huge numbers and this  

86
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:51,280
is also important driver for for you know managing 
cyber security risk at the appropriate level  

87
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,680
in last couple of months we get more and more 
questions about california consumer privacy  

88
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,920
act this is coming state side many other 
states are also implementing their own laws  

89
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,360
so yes compliances are also driving all of this  

90
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,400
i always say they should do that regardless of 
the compliance but if compliance helps okay let's  

91
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:22,720
use that help uh in my entire career i have 
always have always been in a position where i see  

92
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:32,720
myself mainly operating in a zone between 
business legal or compliance officers and i.t  

93
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,880
people and trying to make those three people 
understand each other is actually what i do

94
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:47,360
and it's really important that we try 
and speak the same language sometimes  

95
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:54,880
this language gets kind of prioritized by certain 
groups and then we ran into troubles for example  

96
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:02,080
when you had a gdpr coming into force it 
says regulation a lot of companies have put

97
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:11,439
low law legal experts in force to deal with 
the gdpr on the other side it also says data  

98
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:18,400
protection and what they did they put i.t 
people in charge of dealing with gdpr neither  

99
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:24,720
one of those approaches is correct they need to 
collaborate it is all about privacy privacy is a  

100
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:32,000
little bit uh more of maybe legal personal data 
rights issues personal rights issues it is also  

101
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,880
about technology about i.t about cyber security 
you cannot deal with only one side of this story  

102
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:47,840
and this is uh something what we need also to 
understand in order to be doing the right thing  

103
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:54,640
one organization that actually helps board members 
in understanding their roles and what they should  

104
00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:00,240
do how they should do their job is a national 
association of corporate directors it's based  

105
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,960
in the united states and they have brought cyber 
risk oversight principles so those five principles  

106
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:13,440
actually tell both board members directors 
actually what they need to understand and what  

107
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:20,080
approach they should have to cyber security 
so the first principle says the board needs  

108
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:27,040
needs to understand and approach cyber security 
as enterprise-wide risk management issue not just  

109
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,959
an i.t issue something that i already mentioned 
we still have that you know problem that cyber  

110
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:40,560
security is being put somewhere in it department 
and it is kind of acting as a intermediate between  

111
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:47,119
cyber security and management and even the board 
boards should understand the legal implications  

112
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,640
of cyber risks as they relate to some company 
specific circumstances so what does it actually  

113
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:59,280
mean if we have a data breach what does it 
actually mean if we do not comply with uh i don't  

114
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:05,040
know this is if you if you operate in financial 
sector in financial sector regulations uh about  

115
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:11,199
cyber security what happens in telecommunications 
sector what rules we need to follow and what  

116
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:16,960
actually are we going to pay if we don't they 
should have access to cyber security expertise  

117
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:23,920
this is something that boards often do not have 
and uh one way to deal with that is actually  

118
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:32,000
you know when boards meet they don't have much 
time they usually meet four times a year and that  

119
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,280
is like a full day meeting with a lot of different 
subjects and usually during this entire day they  

120
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,160
find very little time to talk about cyber security 
they talk about other things about strategic  

121
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:51,920
decisions about reports from different committees 
of the organizations they talk with the management  

122
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,599
about business overall and so on cyber 
security must be put on the board's agenda  

123
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:05,680
uh they should also make sure that management 
will establish and uh and enterprise rights at  

124
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:12,160
this management framework with adequate staffing 
and budget we need to know you know how much money  

125
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:18,560
we should dedicate to managing cyber security 
and based on what i often see organizations  

126
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,280
having a disconnection between risk 
assessment and management frameworks  

127
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:34,880
for cyber security and budgeting plans instead 
of using when you find out what type of risk  

128
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,480
you're exposed to and what measures you should 
implement and how much measures cost whether  

129
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:48,000
it's in time money people resources software 
hardware use your budgeting plan in time and  

130
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,400
come to those decision makers video risk treatment 
plans cyber security restriction plans this is  

131
00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:00,640
the right moment you give them the information 
on what also they need to to take into account  

132
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,920
and also as you all know board management 
discussion about cyber risks should always  

133
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:15,119
include those risk treatment options whether 
this will be avoided or accepted or mitigated  

134
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:20,879
or may be transferred through insurance and 
on what i consider the most important once  

135
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,880
the board makes these decisions it should have 
specific brains how it will actually be done  

136
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,000
very often not only on boards but 
also on various management meetings  

137
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,880
we talk about risk we talk about risk reports 
but we never talk about what actual activities  

138
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,120
we are going to undertake who is going 
to be responsible for these activities by  

139
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:50,399
when they should be completed if we do not 
know who what by when we'll do we actually  

140
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,720
haven't done anything we are just switching 
this same conversation to the next meeting

141
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:05,440
a little bit more on the soft skills 
side uh of the problem so what happens at  

142
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:14,080
the boards in most cases uh members of the 
boards are actually 400 business executives  

143
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:20,320
who have had you know a strong management career 
and many different operational functions and they  

144
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,040
have a good oversight of business they know how 
to bring strategy they know how to make important  

145
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:32,800
decisions and how on so on however nowadays still 
they still haven't experienced you know those  

146
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:40,399
technical concepts vocabulary about cyber security 
still pretty strange to them foreign or they don't  

147
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:46,640
talk in technical concepts so this is a little 
bit of a problem i wouldn't say this is a big  

148
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:53,120
problem but average age of the board of directors 
members is 63. today it doesn't seem like such a  

149
00:18:53,120 --> 00:19:01,280
big number but you know these people maybe haven't 
been really familiar with the impact of cyber risk  

150
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:09,440
to organizations business they haven't encountered 
cyberus during the course of their careers on the  

151
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,240
other side which may be a plus they also sit on 
other boards they can see what's happening in  

152
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:20,000
other organizations and they're often concerned 
you know this organization had a problem are we  

153
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,200
to have the same problem or oh look what happened 
here maybe you know maybe we should take something  

154
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,400
some care about this maybe it should happen to us 
as well and then you need to convince them that  

155
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,240
you have everything under control but in order 
to talk to this board you need to be able to come  

156
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,320
and express your opinion and give 
them the information they need

157
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,040
on the other side when you talk about chief 
information security officers social security  

158
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:55,600
experts you know my colleagues we usually come 
from an i.t or maybe audit background background  

159
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:02,720
we often do not know exactly what's happening at 
those board meetings and we do not think in the  

160
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:08,880
board level 10s we are often more tactical more 
operational then we should be you know strategic  

161
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:16,879
and we primarily do our job you know each 
day-to-day activity taking care about  

162
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:24,800
managing cyber risks and and you know facing 
cyber threats staying in compliance and framework  

163
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:30,720
staying in compliance with regulatory requirements 
often dealing with all different kinds of auditors  

164
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:38,400
spending out times on delivering different reports 
uh acquiring solutions talking with vendors and  

165
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:46,320
so on in many uh cases we do not actually 
have all the necessary information about the  

166
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,000
initiatives going on uh at the board level or 
whatever the board is concerned with and we do  

167
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:59,280
not have the direct line of the communication with 
the board often we communicate through the ceo or  

168
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:07,360
any other management uh you know function that is 
responsible for cyber security so how to connect  

169
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:14,159
those two words how to close the gaps so the facts 
are bored on the strategy of the music of the  

170
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:21,040
organization boards provides the risk oversights 
and in order to understand the cyber security risk  

171
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:32,720
they should also make sure that the cyber security 
this uh timely addressed and what is the common  

172
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:40,400
ground of making this a common language for 
both sides for the cio source and for the boards  

173
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,640
risk reporting is one thing so this is a good 
oversight an opportunity for deeper involvement  

174
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:54,000
on both sides because board members understand how 
to talk about risk how to talk about strategy they  

175
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,640
do not necessarily understand cyber securities 
but more you talk with them more information you  

176
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:05,360
provide about you know cyber security risk and 
potential impacts and the environment uh in your  

177
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:12,159
business processes or technology or systems but 
don't go too deeply into technical language better  

178
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:18,560
understanding they will have and when talking 
about how to mitigate those risks or talking about  

179
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:26,159
concrete plans you can use the cyber security 
program it's something that you will be both able  

180
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,560
to talk about very constructively because cyber 
security program on one side is operational  

181
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:40,240
who will do one by one but it's also a strategic 
program board understands strategy risk understand  

182
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,560
ci source and the board as well but the cyber 
security program is something they both understand  

183
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,480
because this involves concrete actions and money

184
00:22:53,200 --> 00:23:00,560
still we need to make sure they have the 
information they need and this information should  

185
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:07,760
be concise and whenever possible whatever you talk 
about risks and the impacts it should be expressed  

186
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:15,440
in financial terms many organizations switch to 
the key risk indicators however a lot of them  

187
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:24,320
get over complicated they select too many key risk 
indicators they monitor and then they get lost in  

188
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,960
the woods of information they don't actually 
need it they don't know what to do with it

189
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,240
you can talk about compliance issues this 
is something always important still you  

190
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,520
know something that really hurts talk about 
desired risk posture of the organization  

191
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,840
cyber security investment plans major projects 
major challenges that you have of those  

192
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:54,720
projects um i would say especially a big challenge 
today and something that we at the ic squared  

193
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:01,680
always monitored is actually this cyber security 
skills gap if you don't have these skilled people  

194
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,400
if you cannot employ the right people if you 
cannot provide them with the right salary  

195
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:13,680
if you cannot continuously educate those people 
they are going to be your weakest link no matter  

196
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:19,280
how much you invest into technology into software 
harder solutions and so on if you do not invest  

197
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:26,639
enough in people then you are not going to be able 
to fight those cyber security risks and threat  

198
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:34,960
actors and whatever you know attack attack vectors 
you have to defend against with your organization

199
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:44,240
however uh always that well you know 
do not complicate keep it simple always  

200
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:50,800
focus around you know 10 key metrics tanky risk 
indicators don't overcome complicated anything  

201
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:00,080
one good practice that i see some boards would 
ask will ask for the results of independent cyber  

202
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,439
security cyber risk management management reviews 
they will select the company besides all those  

203
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:13,200
other auditors you have to deal with to review 
your cyber security posture to review how well  

204
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,280
you are doing and so on i don't know if any of 
you have been following this situation with dd  

205
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:24,879
a chinese company that is similar to uber 
that we have they have recently had an ipo  

206
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:32,000
and right after the ipo the application was taken 
down from the apple store because the chinese  

207
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:39,200
government decided that the cyber security review 
of organization did not meet certain criteria  

208
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:45,120
and that they do not protect personal data right 
you know this can sometimes be also a political  

209
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:52,879
political type of fight so i think it's important 
here to always verify whatever findings you have  

210
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,360
hire two companies do one review okay thank you 
for the results let's see what someone else says  

211
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:08,159
my also advice here is uh do not only look for 
the names of the companies i understand that  

212
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:14,960
big companies are always you know if they see 
a big name and document signed by a big name  

213
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,760
this doesn't necessarily 
mean this is a good review  

214
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,840
whenever you are doing a 
review of your cyber security

215
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:33,040
posture make sure that those actual people doing 
the review are the right people people with  

216
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:38,480
experience people who have performed these 
reviews in other organizations of your type  

217
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,320
of similar organizations people 
would have right credentials  

218
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,760
do not just look for the company name 
look for the people who will do that

219
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:58,639
what the board typically wants to know so you will 
find all of this and these uh materials that i  

220
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:04,720
put a link into my presentation so what at the 
tops are the security risks they would like to  

221
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:10,320
see those risks listed in some kind of fall 
how efficient is our cyber security program  

222
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:16,399
do we need to invest more do we have the right 
skills do we need more technologies one problem  

223
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:26,160
with technologies some ci source in order to 
kind of defend themselves tend to buy solutions  

224
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:32,399
more solutions multiple solutions for the 
same problems i have even experienced working  

225
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:39,440
in companies that have two different projects 
dealing with exact same cyber security risks  

226
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:45,280
because they are coming from different parts of 
the organizations buying a technical solution  

227
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:52,480
is not always you know the best approach first 
make sure to use whatever you already have in  

228
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:59,200
the organization see with the existing vendors if 
they can provide additional services maybe you are  

229
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:05,200
not using all the functionalities of the existing 
solutions that you have maybe you can customize  

230
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:11,360
your own processes use your own development design 
software development the patterns that you have  

231
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:17,840
buying solutions especially when when the vendors 
say buy our solution because it will make you  

232
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:25,760
compliant with whatever that's a red flag you 
know no solution will make you comply with errors  

233
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:33,280
with anything only your processes your practices 
and you know technical measures at the end  

234
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:41,600
solutions at the end but not solutions special 
boards also want to know what are you compliant  

235
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:47,919
with cyber security and data protection regulation 
and this is always the question are we improving  

236
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:54,640
or degrading our risk posture are we spending 
too much or too little so don't be afraid to ask  

237
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:00,080
for money when you come to those board meetings 
because they need to take that into account and  

238
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:07,679
cyber security risk if materials can take whole 
company down so if you need money ask for money

239
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,440
what is the cyber risk associated 
with some new business initiative  

240
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,720
this is also a very very tricky area if you are 
not involved if you do not know about new business  

241
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:27,840
initiatives if you don't have that mechanism of 
making sure information security cyber security  

242
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:34,159
data protection risks are assessed at the 
beginning of any new business initiative not  

243
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:39,440
somewhere you know when everything is already done 
and bought and implemented you are going to be one  

244
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:45,520
step behind and this is too late this is called 
security by design privacy by design i'm sure you  

245
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:51,520
are all familiar with that but you have to have 
that trigger that informs your cyber security team  

246
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:58,159
but there is a new initiative new business 
new projects maybe new major new acquisition  

247
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:04,560
you have to jump into at the beginning before 
things start to actually get implemented if  

248
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:10,159
you are i don't know a company that has to go 
through public uh procurement services and so on  

249
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,600
there is little you can change if you haven't 
been involved into this initiative at the  

250
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:21,840
beginning so make sure cyber security is always 
connected with the project management with  

251
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,600
new business development with those 
people who make these decisions  

252
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:36,480
also cyber security supply chain how 
reliable our contractors do we audit  

253
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:44,080
them are our contracts and sell service level 
agreements well positioned do we have the  

254
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:49,679
right to audit cyber security of our supply 
chain and do we actually do that because  

255
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:54,080
sometimes it's written in the agreement and when 
you come and ask okay when was the last time you  

256
00:30:54,080 --> 00:31:00,000
tested i don't know your vendor's ability to 
recover its system if in case something happens  

257
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:08,000
well never why well we didn't think it's important 
of course it's important maybe the answer will be  

258
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:13,120
they say they've been tested by someone else 
and they provided us with the report okay  

259
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,919
this may be fine but make sure you have 
that sentence in your agreement that also  

260
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:24,160
allows you to perform this test if necessary 
especially for critical cyber security providers

261
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:32,960
there is also another source of information but i 
think it's very good it's uh by the organization  

262
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:39,520
of american states covering of course the latin 
america it's called called guiding principles for  

263
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:45,840
presenting to the board of cyber security so you 
will find the material on the link provided here  

264
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,920
just in short make sure when you come 
to the board meetings as the cso or  

265
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:58,080
cyber security expert whatever you are going to 
present make sure it's relevant to the audience  

266
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,879
is it full board you're talking to or maybe 
you're talking to a key committee such as  

267
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,360
risk committee or maybe audit committee or 
whatever committee the board has for this  

268
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:15,440
um make sure it's reader friendly don't use 
too much text focus on graphics and summaries  

269
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:23,360
and executive summary a world technical jargon 
although today's boards should be more and more  

270
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:29,199
familiar with the technical jargon so you 
know i think with time this uh kind of uh  

271
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:38,000
being afraid to talk about uh technology this 
will change we are all gonna talk about technology  

272
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,160
because it's just our everyday life and we should 
expect the board members to understand technology  

273
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:54,160
i will never forget when those people in american 
senate were questioning facebook ceo about privacy  

274
00:32:54,160 --> 00:33:00,320
and data protection practices and it was obvious 
they couldn't understand what he was talking about  

275
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:05,280
but this is changing so those board members will 
be able to understand what we are talking about  

276
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:13,680
uh community insights not just information so what 
is happening how it's changing how are we managing  

277
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:20,720
risk why we are more exposed in one position 
what changed in the risk contexts and uh what  

278
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:26,720
have we done about that if this is some kind of 
a really significant risk how should we prepare  

279
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:35,280
and you know just discuss with the board the board 
often wants to know about other organizations  

280
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:41,360
about industry averages they always ask for some 
sort of maturity assessment you should have that  

281
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:47,679
really as well and also indicate impact on 
business operations costs market share if  

282
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:58,800
you see again ipo of the dd company in just a few 
days after after the ipo the market the stock fed  

283
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:06,160
uh why because of the privacy concerns in cyber 
security consensus so you can neglect this impact  

284
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:15,120
as well avoid information overload and above 
all enable discussion in dialogue and i've seen  

285
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:20,880
situations where you have a ci so presenting to 
the board and then everyone in the room is quiet  

286
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:27,440
so why is everyone quiet and you know they 
see i saw leaves the room uncomfortable did  

287
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,320
i say something wrong or maybe i didn't say 
what they were expecting me to say and so on  

288
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,000
don't do that ask them you know is it possible 
that you don't have any questions so you know  

289
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,960
make sure they understood everything or 
just you know point to a person and ask that  

290
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,600
specific person so what do you think would 
you like to discuss something and so on so  

291
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:54,719
silence is never a good sign make sure 
you enable discussion and dialogue most  

292
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:58,720
probably it will come from the board from 
the board members anyways in case it doesn't  

293
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,839
you initiate that discussion dialogue 
you will feel better afterwards

294
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:13,120
that's all i had to say i had 35 minutes 
for my presentation i think i was in time  

295
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:21,360
here are my content details i hope you 
will have questions for me and i will be  

296
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:27,200
happy to answer those questions feel free to 
contact me on linkedin i'm very active there  

297
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:36,560
and also directly through my company and i hope 
i will be visiting latin america again very soon

298
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:43,839
thank you very much

299
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,839
necessary

300
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,960
so the question is how will you calculate  

301
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:39,840
the budget amount necessary for the 
cyber security program in a company

302
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,840
feet

303
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,920
okay so

304
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:07,840
then you have a cyber security 
program you have come to that

305
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:08,960
excuse me

306
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,720
should i answer the question in the chat or

307
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,840
live

308
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,720
in the chat in the chat please

309
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:49,840
in the chat okay no problem

310
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:42,720
how you answer the question 
live so yeah it's easy okay  

311
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:49,520
so you you bring a cyber security program as a 
result of your services turkey risk assessment  

312
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:55,120
i'm sure you understand cyber security risk 
assessment is something that should be done  

313
00:38:55,120 --> 00:39:03,120
at least regularly and many companies do it 
once per year which is i think too little i  

314
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:09,120
much much more believe in continuous cyber 
security risk assessments within companies  

315
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,760
uh as a result of these risk assessments you 
will have something called risk report and  

316
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,800
you will establish a risk assessment methodology 
and you will know and have a management decision  

317
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:28,160
about what risk is acceptable what risk is not 
acceptable based on this management decision  

318
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,440
whenever is risk not acceptable you have to decide 
what to do with that so you have to mitigate  

319
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,640
it or you can avoid that risk or you can maybe 
transfer it to your third party but you have to  

320
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:44,640
do something with that risk sometimes it will be a 
change in a process sometimes it will be changing  

321
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:51,040
uh technology that you are using sometimes it will 
be implementing new solutions technical solutions  

322
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:59,120
software solutions hardware solutions whatever use 
uh whenever possible i would say use your internal  

323
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:05,440
knowledge if you don't have internal knowledge 
find someone who can provide you with the number  

324
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,000
of i don't know let's say two three different 
solutions that you could incorporate into your  

325
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,720
environment someone who is familiar with 
your environment and can tell you about each  

326
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:20,480
solution how much it will cost what will what 
are the pluses or minuses of accepting solution  

327
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:29,040
find out for your company how much this solution 
costs and talk to the vendor and see of course you  

328
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:35,200
know is this some price that will hold the line 
or it can extend to i don't know they usually give  

329
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:40,640
you a smaller price at the beginning and then they 
tend to complicate it further with you know more  

330
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:49,040
expenses so on so whatever type of this treatment 
actions you have to take buying the solutions  

331
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:55,440
investing into people changing processes 
try to estimate how much this will cost  

332
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:02,000
and adjust your program to those estimations and 
present the program as such together with the  

333
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,640
numbers to the management so whether it's internal 
work find out how many people will have to work  

334
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:13,920
on mitigating a certain risk if it's buying a 
solution you know pick through two or three of  

335
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:19,920
them and make sure you understand benefits or 
disadvantages of each one of them and how much  

336
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,560
it will cost for your company and a lot of cases 
when talking about those solutions because they  

337
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:29,440
are the most expensive you can maybe start 
with a pilot a lot of vendors would actually  

338
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:34,560
offer you to run a pilot together with them 
and then you can choose to buy the solution so  

339
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:41,359
collect these expenses for all the this 
treatment activities that you have to perform  

340
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:47,280
and this will be the budget amount necessary 
for the cyber security program in your company  

341
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,080
for a certain period of time until the next 
risk assessment until something changes  

342
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:59,759
when you read a cyber security framework it always 
says risk assessment should be performed at least  

343
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:05,280
you know annually or biannual or something 
like that an ideal case it should be performed  

344
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,959
continuously but it should be always performed 
when something changes within the organization

345
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:20,160
i think there is um another 
question thank you definitely

346
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:34,640
exactly and the board should be very very 
well aware on how much we are spending on  

347
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:40,879
cyber security what are the risks and 
cyber security should be able to send  

348
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:46,640
this direct and clear message to the board 
it doesn't mean it's saying anything you  

349
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:53,200
know against ceo or it's not cooperating 
with the ceo it just has to be understood  

350
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:59,839
as a message at the highest possible level and 
ceo should be also the enabler of this message

351
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,840
thank you thank you you're welcome

352
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,839
a

353
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:07,839
thank you thank you for inviting me 
and have a great rest of the conference
