comolli in a correct professional institute

36
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,990
this when you are going to present your

37
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,780
paper that they are of  messer josh and the

38
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,450
vulnerabilities that it deals with the

39
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:39,829
implementations that companies make

40
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:41,740
the technical and cultural changes

41
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,549
necessary to adapt the

42
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:46,429
erbol methodology by introducing

43
00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:48,289
practices such as continuous integration continuous

44
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:50,659
delivery continuous monitoring of

45
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:54,170
infrastructure as I have seen then

46
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,979
we passed and stayed from the  go from four

47
00:01:57,979 --> 00:01:59,700
forward

48
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,860
to see how good afternoon

49
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,590
thank you very much for the presentation

50
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:08,229
an introduction first of all thank

51
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:13,030
in the organization of 8.8 Andean that

52
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,629
has allowed me to approve my

53
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:18,989
presentation in agreement and

54
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:23,799
without more because the time is short we are going

55
00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:28,120
to start and good the talk  It is highlighted

56
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,209
the possibility is that I remember my name  Re

57
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:32,890
is Juan Oliva, well, I did the

58
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:36,040
presentation, actually, rather

59
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,810
than reviewing the subject, the certifications

60
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,579
and all that I would like to say, let's say

61
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:41,620
comment on them, well, I have been a

62
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,780
linux user for many years.

63
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,000


64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,160
book but if from time to

65
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,200
time I publish let's say some papers I

66
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,480
remember some technical documents

67
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,320
then this

68
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,970
let's say a little let's say I published one

69
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,950
about the pool for services that

70
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,380
have my twitter I manage a blog where I

71
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,030
pointed to the things above all that I

72
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,060
do not want to send me so the  I invite

73
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,330
let's say to visit it and in fact

74
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,090
let's say part in the practical part of the what is

75
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,790
called of the talk and they will

76
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,090
also find it there ok then let's

77
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,900
see first to talk about this this

78
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,690
this issue of that cops and we have to

79
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,390
talk in  first instance about ops

80
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,680
ok because actually it

81
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,019
stood out seems as a consequence of

82
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:38,980
this let's say

83
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,230
and let's say of the pops in essence ok

84
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:45,049
then when  we are talking about the box in

85
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:46,689
reality it is

86
00:03:46,689 --> 00:03:50,360
let's say that the union or the pac or in

87
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,750
some way the interaction between the

88
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,299
operations part and the

89
00:03:56,299 --> 00:03:59,120
development part ok the famous eps and the

90
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,510
famous ops that are let's say both is

91
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:06,190
the operations part then

92
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,739
This has changed a lot in agreement because it is

93
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:12,459
not only about implementing,

94
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:15,799
let's say, new methodologies but also

95
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:18,320
implementing a new way of thinking

96
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,100
about development.

97
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,919


98
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:28,250


99
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,190
implement a

100
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,780
circus a let's say a construction cycle

101
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,529


102
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:38,579
and continuous developments in a very short

103
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:42,629
time because their intention is obviously to

104
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:45,389
reduce implementation failures not to

105
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:47,629
wait until until the last

106
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:50,219
let's say to realize that there is

107
00:04:50,219 --> 00:04:53,159
a failure in what is called this in the

108
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,919
en  the development of a module that was not

109
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,439
taken into account et cetera et cetera and to be able

110
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:01,259
to do what is called

111
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:07,830
rollbacks very quickly  Mind ok is then

112
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,740
let's say that this need what it has

113
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,880
done is that it can be generated

114
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,730
let's say deploy the applications and it is

115
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,500
finished testing today we are going to

116
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,750
find a lot of

117
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,850
rock software terminology so the

118
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:27,680
blogger term is let's say generate or postpone

119
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,440
production frequently

120
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,080
software products then that

121
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,040
is a bit let's say what what

122
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,370
the ideology of the pops involves in

123
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:44,120
general.According to then to see and

124
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,570
behind that what we find is a lot

125
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,820
of practical terminology.According to

126
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,470
we find the first issue that is

127
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,930
integration  continues that it is nothing more than

128
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,860
the automation of the

129
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,529
code generation process ok

130
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:03,869
let's say that it is normally previously

131
00:06:03,869 --> 00:06:05,759
all developers kept their

132
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,969
code and within their own within

133
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:10,919
their own machine today this has

134
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:12,839
obviously changed with this new

135
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,109
form of development no  we're all

136
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:19,799
talking about hosting a let's say

137
00:06:19,799 --> 00:06:21,029
developers are hosted in a

138
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:24,239
ce repository  ntral their codes and they

139
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:26,849
generate through various, let's say,

140
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:29,309
various versions with the objective of

141
00:06:29,309 --> 00:06:31,169
obviously correcting errors and

142
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:32,999
continuing to advance in development,

143
00:06:32,999 --> 00:06:35,579
we call that continuous integration that

144
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:38,309
we could represent in this way,

145
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:41,519
other than the developers have,

146
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:43,919
let's say, their code repository and

147
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,009
through  They are doing puig no if

148
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:49,370
we talk about terminology there

149
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,400
towards a central repository and generating

150
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,520
many versions until they manage to have,

151
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,270
let's say, their final product, ok then

152
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,440
that could also be represented,

153
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,650
let's say in this way, many

154
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,479
work teams that in the end use a

155
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:08,720
central repository  as a lab

156
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,020
and let's say that

157
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,690
others say the product is that in the

158
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,879
long run what they do is the same to know a

159
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:19,500
central repository ok then

160
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,250
then we talk about

161
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,200
continuous deployment according as one

162
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,300
more step to continuous integration

163
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,520
then the study of continuing

164
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,920
we talk about releasing of

165
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,720
automatically changes made from

166
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,330
repos  Itories to say that we already have in our

167
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,880
code, let's say in the repository and what

168
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,350
it does is that it is continually

169
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:43,380
grabbing for it or any mechanisms or that there are

170
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,080
and if it stands out because in reality there are

171
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,630
many mechanisms to do this ok and

172
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,060
that is also a strong point to  take

173
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,640
consideration to grab that repository and

174
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,630
then then some software

175
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,840
software mechanism to make or play to

176
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,300
the production environments I run

177
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,030
then these would look like it is

178
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,500
forming then from the

179
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,230
central repository there is some mechanism is

180
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,570
software that grabs in the

181
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:16,710
central repository and the  leads towards it pushes the

182
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:19,680
code so that it begins to build,

183
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,930
let's say development at the software level,

184
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,850
one of the best known

185
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,600
software that makes

186
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,240
me almost in kings obviously but

187
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,730
obviously there is another type of software,

188
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:34,409
let's say that it also does it, why

189
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:37,500
then we continue in the flow  the

190
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,169
developer putsches into his

191
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:42,509
jeep repository a nutty

192
00:08:42,509 --> 00:08:45,560
whatever and this and then

193
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,600
something lets say q  eu in the continuous delivery

194
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,410
what tools like jenkins

195
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,509
grab detect in this change and what they

196
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:57,930
do is start building a directive,

197
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:01,819
start building and this is the

198
00:09:01,819 --> 00:09:04,920
development itself, let's say at the software level,

199
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,750
which is why a

200
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,089
lot of technologies are handled  As the

201
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,970
artifacts through a repository,

202
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:13,410
let's say the query of the records

203
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,300
in December, we work with

204
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,709
containers, etc.

205
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,440


206
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,440


207
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,720


208
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,670


209
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,620
It is automation of the

210
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,450
process of creating infrastructure

211
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,600
from code ok we no longer speak in the

212
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,640
traditional way where we did

213
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,470
say next next next

214
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,070
to create a virtual machine or create,

215
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:45,589
let's say, certain environments according to

216
00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:48,410
we are not talking about it through

217
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:51,339
the code these are created  environments

218
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:55,550
say to host or to deploy the

219
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,760
software

220
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,630
then here tradition  At least we can

221
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:04,570
talk about docker in agreement but

222
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,640
obviously behind that there are

223
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,910
much more complex things such as govern et is an

224
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,740
agreement so it will depend a

225
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,900
little on what it uses at that

226
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,240
level let's say each company ok there

227
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,760
also where they are generated let's say  It

228
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,070
opens the range of things a lot for us, an

229
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,400
agreement then

230
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,960
then through a code is

231
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,470
inserted, let's say in the

232
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:34,040
development in these forms

233
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,000
of software repositories, whether it is

234
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,400
rocker governing containers or

235
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,460
through ranchers, which I do not want to

236
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,580
focus on software in reality but more

237
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,920
that nothing on the subject of the flow of agreement

238
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,120
to put it into

239
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,550
production through those 98 would be with a small

240
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,860
graph the continuum of levels what it

241
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:58,850
does is start to generate in sending those

242
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,610
processes where we say in this case

243
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,410
it is built in containers that go  to

244
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,720
host in the town software processes

245
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,020


246
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,279
then he

247
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:15,310
once I already have let's say

248
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,590
my software in production talks

249
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,950
about the management mouse  On of the configuration ok are

250
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,140
the identification processes controls

251
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,990
auditing within the flow of apps

252
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,300
according to this will depend on a lot

253
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,180
of dedication of each company if it was

254
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,250
implemented they are not in the end

255
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,510
non-mandatory terminologies according to but this but

256
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,580
in some way

257
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,350
let's say some way  mark in the guideline

258
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,150
of what I should have had,

259
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,430
anyway, it should have a process

260
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:49,790
within my xbox methodology, this is

261
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,339
a process of control and identification

262
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:53,870
of all those assets that I am,

263
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,240
let's say, deploying because if not how did I

264
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,110
monitor it

265
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,100
then let's say we have  Here in the

266
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,830
part of we can handle, let's say that

267
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:08,360
architectures like the one that we say already

268
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,840
involve the part of the operations people more

269
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,040
and also depend on how

270
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,600
the teams are organized according to

271
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,050
because some are the famous that are

272
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,780
who are dedicated only to it to

273
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,420
facilitate it.  which are the evolution

274
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,430
of the operations agent that are dedicated to

275
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:29,460
facilitating the entire environment so that the

276
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,200
developers

277
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,370
can let's say deploy their

278
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,440
applications why

279
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,500
then challenges

280
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,860
challenges behind this what from the

281
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,390
post part really said

282
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,340
developments continuous and

283
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,460
fast implementations that is the goal of data

284
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,260
scalability of power let's say

285
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,970
easily through these technologies

286
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:55,030
comfortable but with how erneta is  to be able to be

287
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:58,030
scalable, let's say without further signs and

288
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,460
effort, but if in some way with

289
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,139
measurable environments, ok

290
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:05,449
and now it is obviously and already entering the

291
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:07,069
field, it has an

292
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:08,480
attack surface because because I am using

293
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,350
new technologies that then

294
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:16,129
we are already talking here about desktops in agreement and

295
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,859
this  It implies the implementation of a new

296
00:13:18,859 --> 00:13:20,569
set of skills that must be

297
00:13:20,569 --> 00:13:22,189
taken into account if I already have it, because it

298
00:13:22,189 --> 00:13:25,220
represented that and so it is that I am going to

299
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,049
involve

300
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:31,040
processes of this security within the

301
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,119
analysis of let's say security

302
00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:38,480
within those processes within this

303
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,939
methodology then  we already talked about

304
00:13:40,939 --> 00:13:43,740
new types of skills in  So

305
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,230
here the plant would be no if we see the

306
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,730
security of the last stage of

307
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,050
development

308
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:52,590
and obviously that is going to have

309
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:55,230
a higher cost according to

310
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,390
because if I wait, let's say only

311
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:00,890
when I am already

312
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:03,780
developing through sports it is  I have already

313
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,760
started up and I am just going to go

314
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,430
through a code

315
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,180
verification dependency verification

316
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,000
scans penetration tests

317
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,190
verify if there are

318
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,640
monitoring tools for it

319
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,590
obviously all that is going to be much

320
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:26,370
more expensive ok so now

321
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,580
we are going to

322
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,190
obviously correct  this in the

323
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:35,070
early stages saves time and

324
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:38,760
money ok if i can lets say fix

325
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,990
this in and there are many ways we should

326
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,580


327
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,250
raise this issue if i can for

328
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,670
example introduce for sure

329
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:54,440
ok automated scans or

330
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,200
ok scan code analysis scans

331
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,900
and  also

332
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,510
security checks in the

333
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,880
infrastructure process as code so

334
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,670
I'm already downgrading  a lot a lot let's say

335
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:11,160
the risks that we tell myself the

336
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,860
software products have problems and

337
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,020
can only be identified in the

338
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,840
last stages ok

339
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,080
then

340
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,810
what happens if i am improving this

341
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:26,670
which is a bit the idea the same

342
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:31,740
methodology of drops that is yes  in

343
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,380
seven parts the continuous deployment

344
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,870
of epsa cox what he tries to implement

345
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,270
is

346
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,010
let's say security reviews also

347
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:43,920
continuous then if I

348
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,410
implemented that book in

349
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:50,070
him and in him and on the day that it is infrastructure

350
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,390
as of the infrastructure writes

351
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:55,100
as  code I can implement let's say

352
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,350
processes an agreement that help me to

353
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,770
verify these problems so I can

354
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:04,860
this let's say reduce a lot the

355
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,440
security gap in my continuous development in

356
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,120
my products that farc at the end in

357
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,730
which it is required ok then we

358
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:14,790
talk again do not automate let's say review

359
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,470
of  source code check

360
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:20,160
target dependencies this

361
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,730
check and I feel like then

362
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,340
that's where we can take  r these issues

363
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,449
but

364
00:16:28,449 --> 00:16:31,209
now essentially based on this without

365
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:32,889
introducing ourselves to a system of

366
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:36,309
tools that is that pop is, let's say,

367
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:38,350
the effort in the fight to remedy the

368
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,910
default security and between quotes,

369
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,139
security by default because

370
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:44,230
obviously we all think about

371
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,029
security from the beginning  But the issue is

372
00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:48,220
that if we are implementing it well, I

373
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,999
cannot now the idea is to integrate

374
00:16:51,999 --> 00:16:53,889
security through tools and here

375
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:56,589
I put an asterisk because in reality and

376
00:16:56,589 --> 00:16:59,199
this is a bit the reason for the talk

377
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,629
according to there that we are going to see

378
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:02,730
Later on,

379
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,949
many tools to put,

380
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:08,138
let's say, within our flow of

381
00:17:08,138 --> 00:17:10,990
our methodology or within our

382
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,789
ideology of the box, many

383
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:15,490
security tools but the issue is how

384
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:17,888
we are handling it because those who

385
00:17:17,888 --> 00:17:19,980
are implementing them, who are

386
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,849
making them, those who review those reports

387
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:26,240


388
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,850
then  develops a culture of safety

389
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,890
as a code of agreement we no longer expect

390
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,370
us to say in sayamo  s that

391
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,710
the application is deployed so that it is

392
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:39,170
just to be able to review, let's say the

393
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,210
application, but we go from the

394
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:45,059
code to be able to correct it, it

395
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:48,110
promotes cross-ability because

396
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,269
there are various competencies

397
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:53,429
working together and this is very much the problem

398
00:17:53,429 --> 00:17:56,580
of this, let's say to implement this type of

399
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,460
ideology  I agree that

400
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,350
there are many competencies that we are going to

401
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,450
talk about later then in essence they

402
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:07,169
allow should should ok facilitate the

403
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,059
management in the rapid development on a large

404
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:10,830
scale because I already have that through the

405
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:13,649
cecop my flow is my product that

406
00:18:13,649 --> 00:18:16,259
lends more in quotes  I'm sure I

407
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:18,899
'm going safe implementations ok that

408
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:21,659
should allow scaling of

409
00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:24,269
processes much more fluid an agreement is

410
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,970
let's say what is expected and they helped with

411
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,909
a secure environment by default that is to

412
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:33,480
say if we say make sure

413
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,570
that once the software product is

414
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:39,419
this  it is as it is called of tested it

415
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,190
is already in production this strap has passed

416
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,360
corr  ectly all the

417
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,419
security tests because then but always

418
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:47,429
but from that quad or simply a

419
00:18:47,429 --> 00:18:50,450
threat model according to the

420
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:52,640
continuous integration let's say that I can

421
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,620
verify that errors of

422
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,720
sensitive information such as database users

423
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,480
two passwords is let's say

424
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,380
plain text  ok in the continuous delivery

425
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:07,150
through the tests I can

426
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,320
detect through the code review to be able to

427
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,020
detect sql injection the pse with

428
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,780
xs address s

429
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,010
vulnerable dependency that is a lot

430
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:19,730
let's say ignore it is an agreement

431
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,560
and do not perform scans decade after

432
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,620
each  stages we do not win and now but

433
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,450
also I can not neglect the

434
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,640
vulnerabilities in the insecure itself

435
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,890
as code in containers for example

436
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:33,050
there are a lot of vectors let's say towards

437
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:36,020
let's say things like two that werner

438
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,750
ok and check if they meet a minimum

439
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,570
configuration standard obviously ok

440
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:45,350
but  it will be known once everything let's say that

441
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,910
I have gone through all these

442
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:49,670
reviews its say me  If it would be necessary to

443
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:53,000


444
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,010
permanently supervise and monitor the applications against

445
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:57,410
attack, that is to say that it has in some

446
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,950
way is in some way

447
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,920
proactive defense or you monitor

448
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,720
proactive monitoring according to

449
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:12,020
now the idea would be how to implement it to

450
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,570
that let's say we have a lot

451
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:17,580
of terminology in agreement

452
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,470
The terminology that I

453
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,150
share is the one that you personally saw

454
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,670
my experience because working on it

455
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:26,400
I know that there are other terminology

456
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,990
that suddenly out there they will sit and we

457
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:32,310
will talk in the chat ok but this is the

458
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,410
good essence and the same agrees and  That

459
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,450
is a bit what I would like to

460
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:39,560
say to share that is to say between comics

461
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,650
determination of version control ok

462
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,110
and before configuring the

463
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,060
repository check vulnerabilities

464
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,100
ok

465
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,130
in the management of the secrets

466
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:55,879
agree what

467
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,379
if I am correctly managed

468
00:20:57,379 --> 00:21:00,469
the passwords  key the tokens of

469
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:03,679
atis in agreement and this, let's say, if the

470
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,899
services that are available today  We even generate

471
00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:08,719
towards this towards the repositories or

472
00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:12,199
do deployment ok this is important

473
00:21:12,199 --> 00:21:13,819
is practical application security testing

474
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:17,659
ok what you want here is that

475
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:20,839
if we say make tests of

476
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:23,629
the code review ok let's say from the code

477
00:21:23,629 --> 00:21:26,659
verify if my code is say no

478
00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:30,019
it has some problem at the development level

479
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:32,440


480
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,340
then we talk about building a little

481
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:37,160
more with more let's say I don't know if complex

482
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,840
but more laborious software with two

483
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,410
said analyzes to identify

484
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,450
let's say

485
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:47,300
vulnerabilities in dependencies

486
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,740
according to which is also very important

487
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,300
because sometimes our code is fine, it

488
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,240
's fine  In fact, but the

489
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,080
software dependency that we use this, let's say,

490
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,210
are not well maintained by the

491
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,520
developers who have made them

492
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,740
great dependencies many times and then

493
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,870
forget about their maintenance, and

494
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,700
that is where the problems come, on the

495
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,100
other hand, there are also many

496
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,170
dependencies that apparently are

497
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:15,290
vulnerable but their areas of

498
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:18,310
exploitation  They are very complex, so

499
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,330
let's say the probability of being

500
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,130
exploited by a dependency that

501
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,960
apparently because of the tool tells me

502
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,810
that it is exploitable is minimal, then

503
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:28,790
also those considerations are what

504
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,500
we have why

505
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,080
dynamic application security testing or you

506
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,680
give that it is not more than what  What

507
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,590
we would do is what counts is what we

508
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:42,470
do let's say in testing it is nothing more than a

509
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:47,390
review of the front end of

510
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:48,920
the applications to verify

511
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,920
vulnerabilities already in the part let's say

512
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,410
in the dynamic part of the body now

513
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,570
take into account that you are from here

514
00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:00,010
from  yes, that's it, and we're

515
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:02,450
talking about that all of these are

516
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,790
automated processes, okay, so my

517
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,770
question would be all those tools

518
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,990
that make these automated processes

519
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,360
do them well,

520
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,429
the other round would be all these

521
00:23:13,429 --> 00:23:14,510
tools that make all those

522
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:17,360
processes who review them and who

523
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,820
apply  the corrections of that is a

524
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,000
bit let's say that I would have to go

525
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,780
wondering what with coexistence  gums code

526
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,990
what compliance is and this will also

527
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,700
differ a lot from each company if it is

528
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,980
implementing if I am going to comply with

529
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:37,580
pci dss or if I am going to comply, let's say the

530
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,600
pm standards or then

531
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,250
let's say that it will depend a lot on what

532
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,780
is aligned for example

533
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,370
banks that need their

534
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:50,040
developments to be aligned at prices ok

535
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,909
and finally

536
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,850
let's say to be their mind with the

537
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,919
skills that is to say analysis of

538
00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:00,100
known vulnerabilities ok that in

539
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,230
theory all this should have been reduced

540
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:07,120
let's say until we got here because

541
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,500
and last and not least

542
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,290
contains the scanner that verifies the

543
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:13,690
vulnerabilities in the containers

544
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:14,800
then after all this

545
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,260
terminology the idea would be like an

546
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,900
implement and in what part then for

547
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,970
that this is mandatory this

548
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,830
let's just say that as I say is part let's say

549
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:26,950
of one's experience is that this for

550
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,870
example  we can implement certain

551
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:32,890
certain statements certain parts in the

552
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:34,990
continuous integration in the continuous

553
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:37,809
delivery in infrastructure as code

554
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,300
for example in the continuum there comes

555
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:44,050
to be say yes or yes evaluation of

556
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:46,809
the source code ok and evaluation of the

557
00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:49,090
dynamic part of the application and in the

558
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:51,370
infrastructure as code perform the

559
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:54,880
vulnerability analysis part ok

560
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,990
and so on

561
00:24:59,149 --> 00:25:02,299
successively we can also see it in this way and

562
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:04,999
a little more entering and as

563
00:25:04,999 --> 00:25:06,710
regional it is mandatory because it will

564
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,809
depend on how it is that within my

565
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:12,229
opzz process I included these as

566
00:25:12,229 --> 00:25:16,330
these stages are called

567
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,960
now this would be a graph already at the level

568
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,140
of  tools ok

569
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,640
there are many other alternatives that I have

570
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,980
done is but let's say because they are 12

571
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:30,850
minutes in agreement and this

572
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:34,450
to be able to apply in each of these

573
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,720
let's say stages in my flow of the box

574
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,590
include tools that generate this

575
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:43,990
s security statement ok

576
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:45,460
as I say let's say  The tools

577
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,040
are not mandatory but let's say the idea is to

578
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,950
have in, let's say, at each stage some

579
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:55,230
part of reviews, ok

580
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,780
then this you already know  And let's say much

581
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,090
much better in agreement with developers

582
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,740
things like talisman that we have a

583
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:06,100
delay visit of that in s is to arrive

584
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,310
let's say dependency verification that

585
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,630
we say a software and we go

586
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:13,840
before good blood for sas for that

587
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,240
vast proxy that is the best of  agreement

588
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,820
for the management part of vulnerable

589
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:22,240
non-scans regularities architecs that

590
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,060
are two things

591
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,850
and restructuring let's say scanning in

592
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,500
open badass trinity infrastructure and

593
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,620
so we could talk a lot more about

594
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:35,670
them according to monitoring and managing

595
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,180
secrets

596
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,280
now the challenges of that thing is

597
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,420
let's say is

598
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:48,300
security automation ok yes and to verify security

599
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,430
in a traditional way for pen

600
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,950
testers is complex and you have to have

601
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,540
a certain skin

602
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,730
and almost all of them are already specializing

603
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:58,770
they are not specialists in web applications

604
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:00,180
you are competitors others

605
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,890
find in other governors and then

606
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:05,040
care and  other things then that implies

607
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,950
let's say a much more complex environment ok

608
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,930
integra  ar security tools in the

609
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,810
flow of water also the people who

610
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:16,470
implement, let's say the correct one, the

611
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,210
correct plugin of each time one of

612
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,740
those tools and that everyone can

613
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:23,160
be in the same flow of the pops ok

614
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,890
and most importantly cultural changes

615
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:27,720
because it may involve  that both

616
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,510
development people and people from let's say

617
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,760
operations and now the people of their

618
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,400
day can work

619
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,840
so we are talking that there

620
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,679
are many challenges out there so

621
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,850
we are going to see specific two points

622
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,309
quickly

623
00:27:43,309 --> 00:27:47,820
three comics ok that is what

624
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:51,330
wants programmatic to attack this

625
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:54,919
all that is this access focus on let's say

626
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:57,870
plain text information ok as

627
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:01,230
you see keys and other things casey ok

628
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,690
then this helps developers to

629
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:06,120
let's say avoiding incorrect publication

630
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,629
of this

631
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,070
as we attack it or how or what

632
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,750
we can use  well this is an

633
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,820
alternative time and your job is to

634
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,559
ensure that potential secrets

635
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,559
don't leave the workstation.  developer garlic

636
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:22,158


637
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,650
then what do we need for

638
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:27,020
that configure jit repositories installed

639
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,580
in the development machine and then

640
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,320
integrate it into these continuous

641
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,870
intervention ok let's quickly see

642
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,809
this

643
00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:38,559
for this I have here a little wine

644
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,190
ok

645
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:45,120
then here we have a this a

646
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,390
repository of  agreement and then what we are

647
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:51,810
going to do is make, for example, a

648
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:54,840
clone of a well-known project

649
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,760
called / blear that surely many

650
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,860
know because the application hamburger

651
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,260


652
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:03,390
then we make a little one ok

653
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:06,180
let's say a

654
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:10,650
local repository of hits we define the variables ok

655
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:13,410
to be able  connect us for this you already saw

656
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:17,250
previously what I did was this include

657
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,710
my key the key that was generated from the

658
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:22,050
development machine to my

659
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:24,600
git repository here so let's say

660
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,690
special navigation what then added my

661
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:30,930
remote repository according to and then

662
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,870
I make yours and  it asks me for my key what

663
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,860
the public key

664
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:39,200
is and what it does is let's say make the

665
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,559
di bus  Let's go from what I have to

666
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,720
my repository, the genre, we already had it,

667
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,640
this branch more ok then until

668
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,190
there I have it, it removes me now what I am going to

669
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,659
do is install talisman for that it

670
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:56,690
needs this dependency according to the

671
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:59,260
dependency

672
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,620
then I download talisman

673
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:08,350
is  only one is let's say that an h

674
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,570
let's say an installation script I give it

675
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,780
execution permission then install

676
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,480
talisman ok it tells me let's say where

677
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,820
the environment variables will be where it

678
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,880
will position where the

679
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,380
exception files will be because it

680
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:26,350
also handles exceptions issues  where it

681
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:29,620
goes is where the jobs are, I am no longer

682
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,420
a little auxiliary but it is also

683
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:34,059
important but above all where is my

684
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:36,340
directory, let's say where is my

685
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,690
rest directory or my

686
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:40,150
repository with which he is going to scan

687
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:43,210
before launching it to the central repository

688
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:45,280
then  I define in this case roe from

689
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,580
vw to where I am working

690
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,890
then we are going to create

691
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,950
a file that is for example

692
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:56,460
called

693
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:01,289
that s  and call secrets okay

694
00:31:01,289 --> 00:31:04,259
then I put my secrets there which

695
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:08,410
are keys for example of this

696
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,230
[Music]

697
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,090


698
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:14,070
flames suddenly I am working with mistresses

699
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:17,600
because then

700
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,960
and added to my re possible let's say let's say

701
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,750
short lady adds secrets and then tries to make a committee to a

702
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,820
committee

703
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,350
committee then he

704
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:31,010
detects the secret files of agreement

705
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:33,620
and what he tells me is that in the secret file he

706
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,780
is adding these things that

707
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:38,840
are potentially vulnerable because

708
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,570
they do not have to be uploaded because they are

709
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,430
excess center files and that someone else is going to

710
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,840
upload the repository

711
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,520
Obviously, he knows our

712
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,190
fair repository, you can add in

713
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:52,130
agreement then he performs

714
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:55,640
that type of scan on me ok before that is

715
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,740
now if I want in any way due

716
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:01,730
to operation issues or exceptions, what do I know,

717
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:03,470
there are many variants in this type of

718
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:05,930
thing then I  I want to make an

719
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,850
exception so the tool

720
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:10,280
allows me to grab grab the fingerprint

721
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,710
of that create a file that is  call

722
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:15,120
talisman point of rc

723
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,600
then I can

724
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,170
add it so that he ignores the ok

725
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:24,750
yet it is not linear obviously but there are

726
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,910
many there are many conjectures behind

727
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,860
that there are things that obviously

728
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,470
cannot be avoided but I have to say

729
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:34,500
what we say in this case this way

730
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,390
to work because there are other

731
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:38,070
tools for that is precisely to

732
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:40,800
protect the developer from making us

733
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,380
puig in the repository this kind

734
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:46,350
of thing okay so that's a

735
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,660
bit this part

736
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,830
ok

737
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:53,830
then alternatives we have these

738
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,269
let's say other software as I say the

739
00:32:55,269 --> 00:32:56,950
idea is not  to stay with tools

740
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:00,100
but to stay with the idea and I still do not know

741
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,630
what we can do

742
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:04,559
preventively because

743
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,980
now if we talk about

744
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,659
static analysis security casting things

745
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:13,440
in agreement that is to say analysis of the code

746
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,899
ok then what is the scope

747
00:33:15,899 --> 00:33:18,240
of security tests to speak something

748
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,129
automated tools look for

749
00:33:20,129 --> 00:33:22,710
vulnerabilities in the code ok that is and

750
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:25,230
try to identify that with injection

751
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:27,899
xs s insecure libraries etc.

752
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:31,049
etc. from the code ok which I

753
00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:33,600
would tell you and it is complex because for that

754
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,629
we have to go there I want to highlight this

755
00:33:36,629 --> 00:33:38,159
is tools configured by default

756
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,549
of generic revision configuration ok

757
00:33:41,549 --> 00:33:44,279
manual revision is necessary that is to say

758
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:45,659
I cannot stay with it  The report is

759
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:47,519
only that someone obviously has to

760
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,529
review that and verify

761
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:51,259
the levels of exploitation and lida

762
00:33:51,259 --> 00:33:54,570
accordingly, so for that we can

763
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:56,460
use an alternative like sónarclub

764
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:00,169
that allows a static analysis

765
00:34:00,169 --> 00:34:02,880


766
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,540
of the code, ok, then identify all

767
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,850
these sad things that are not being

768
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,500
reached  But before only three

769
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,780
minutes and we are going to see a little

770
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:17,429
demo of that quickly okay

771
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:19,290
ok we can bring your excellent food

772
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:22,080
then let me not lose already seen

773
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,050
gentlemen so here

774
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:25,580
we have

775
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:28,739
let's say a file called

776
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:32,370
docker compost ok haylock docampo ok now

777
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:35,370
what it is and horns have these

778
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:37,659
things changed i

779
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,549
what in what i have here  it is my

780
00:34:39,549 --> 00:34:43,500
writing that what builds is

781
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,150
my

782
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,679
container and james that makes an

783
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,719
implementation of yanqing if then I have

784
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:53,500
my implementation of sonarkids ok and the

785
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,880
password each known as super

786
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,989
secure because it is a security event ok

787
00:34:55,989 --> 00:34:59,609
then

788
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:03,310
then after that

789
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,870
excellent already  I have seven minutes

790
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:07,720
so after that what I can

791
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:12,670
do is to do a lift let's

792
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:15,340
say from the middle with you lift these

793
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:19,780
containers ok once they

794
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:22,930
tell me that it is let's say it is

795
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:25,440
correctly we have raised

796
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,359
income

797
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:31,650
but I am in

798
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,600
kings ok here depending  Let's say

799
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,600
that obviously the power and there is

800
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:43,690
another factor, let's say the power of me

801
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:45,970
from the machine where I am supporting,

802
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:48,190
then it will depend how fast

803
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,440
when all of the then here I have

804
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,020
let's say who is my continuous

805
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,630
does what we say the continuous part

806
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:58,930
be released ok eye that is an example of

807
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,849
agreement then a tool as

808
00:36:00,849 --> 00:36:01,869
I say do not stay with the

809
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:04,329
rub tool  I know that you stick with what you are doing,

810
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,190
then what I have to

811
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:08,650
tell someone 15 is where my

812
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:09,660


813
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:13,420
sonarclub server is, ok where is it being

814
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:16,750
configured, then what I have to

815
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:19,680
tell you is

816
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,329
what

817
00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:23,839
but below

818
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:27,239
for this in this case there is a  15 are the

819
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:28,739
most popular because it has a series of

820
00:36:28,739 --> 00:36:31,619
plugins, let's say that allow you, let's say,

821
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:33,599
very simple integration with many

822
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,479
tools that is my peru 136 in

823
00:36:36,479 --> 00:36:40,079
port 9000 where it moves, it

824
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:44,279
moves, or is listening, they are nerves,

825
00:36:44,279 --> 00:36:46,279
the container they remember what  Let's create

826
00:36:46,279 --> 00:36:49,460
let's say from the local compost

827
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:52,640
so now what I'm going to do is

828
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,520
create a new chat ok or a new task

829
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,150
ok then because yankee already know where they

830
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,369
are listening they are nerves so they

831
00:37:01,369 --> 00:37:04,250
grabbed create a new task I tell them that

832
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:07,210
the task is going to be called

833
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:10,420
from copsa proyde w

834
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:14,589
chiquita create a freestyle project

835
00:37:14,589 --> 00:37:18,609
ok and then

836
00:37:18,609 --> 00:37:21,970
let's say configure the source of the

837
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:23,589
code where is it going to get the code

838
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:25,660
is this going to get it out of  we are going to

839
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,299
analyze vw as we did

840
00:37:28,299 --> 00:37:31,119
in the other example and this takes us out of

841
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,680
the public repository also

842
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,970
obviously I have a choice if it is an

843
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:38,349
authenticated repository because you see

844
00:37:38,349 --> 00:37:40,599
press and password that is let's say that

845
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:42,160
it is also feasible obviously this

846
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,900
is a  puig directory a

847
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,119
public repository then we give it to execute and we

848
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:48,519
tell it that to execute what it is going to do

849
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:52,089
is to execute a scanner file

850
00:37:52,089 --> 00:37:54,099
why why because it already has

851
00:37:54,099 --> 00:37:56,470
previously let's say the club and let's say

852
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:59,920
installed and the address

853
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,720
the ip address I mean  and also the

854
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:07,550
port that then and here is a bit

855
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:10,310
of the parameterization part ok here where

856
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:13,910
I tell it let's say where it is let's say

857
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,710
what the project is going to be and the

858
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,010
project that it versioned handle where

859
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:21,310
the project is going to host locally

860
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:25,700
workspace the language la  coding the

861
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,480
user knows

862
00:38:28,549 --> 00:38:31,620
then once I have all that

863
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,309
then save

864
00:38:34,309 --> 00:38:38,359
and he this then I tell him that he

865
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:41,449
builds now ok it is in that now

866
00:38:41,449 --> 00:38:44,170
I tell him to build a beat,

867
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:47,359
let's say if they see at the bottom,

868
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,789
okay and he's starting to

869
00:38:49,789 --> 00:38:52,939
do the task, let's say to perform the task, I give him a

870
00:38:52,939 --> 00:38:56,539
console view because, not to mention, stop

871
00:38:56,539 --> 00:38:57,400
being

872
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:02,299
consul friendly, because not so much web,

873
00:39:02,299 --> 00:39:06,380
ok, so here he tells me that it starts.  to

874
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,949
do the whole

875
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,240
process, it connects, let's say with are

876
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:19,279
active, and begins to generate, let's say the

877
00:39:19,279 --> 00:39:20,799
entire language analyst

878
00:39:20,799 --> 00:39:25,190
begins to analyze all the code,

879
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:27,920
according to that it works, and at the end it tells me

880
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,110
that

881
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:31,300
the report can review the report

882
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,870
here, the execution is over.  to the

883
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:37,120
consumer so much

884
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,360
memory ok and I can click here to

885
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,270
see the job is not a bug it took a

886
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:45,820
little time to agree to do enter several times

887
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,470


888
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:50,590
because let's say you still

889
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:52,820
need to build the project and there it

890
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:56,420
is ok then apparently let's say it

891
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:59,330
has happened  That, but I still have six

892
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,670
vulnerabilities to review, okay,

893
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:04,730
so let's say from there I

894
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:07,369
have some vulnerabilities, for

895
00:40:07,369 --> 00:40:10,220
example, and that's  a very specific example

896
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,980
in the first one that happened that it was an http

897
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,650
in glee ok that is a flaw in

898
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:17,810
the parametrization issue at the

899
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:20,360
web server level ok now to

900
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,550
consider the vulnerability if by

901
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:25,369
standard ok but i have to

902
00:40:25,369 --> 00:40:27,650
say check it already how  relevant is

903
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:31,040
because I also have others so the

904
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,980
work just comes here, it is not to

905
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,380
say I have to start or the

906
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,360
developer has to start

907
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,500
reviewing each one of those

908
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,020
vulnerabilities and begin to determine

909
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:45,350
the levels of exploitation ok and if it

910
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:47,030
is not the developer, people  In charge

911
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:49,730
of reviewing this because if it is not of any

912
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:51,619
use in reality if I can not correct at

913
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:53,170
these levels

914
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:54,950
then and

915
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:56,130
[Music]

916
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:58,180
ready then we return to the

917
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,820
presentation

918
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:02,820
and alternatives for this there are

919
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,860
actually several although they already have let's say a

920
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:07,980
small table let's say marc and

921
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,410
some appear  free software others no other

922
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:12,600
make important how many languages

923
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,120
I can say to verify in the case of they

924
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,790
are

925
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:19,710
obviously yes  Well, let's say it meets

926
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:24,000
most of the revision of the

927
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,270
languages

928
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:31,940
so to go to the conclusions ok

929
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:34,520
the development area does not need to think

930
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,520
beyond continuous development but

931
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,290
it is useless to have many tools

932
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:42,320
within the pack line of agreement if they cannot

933
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,940
be  interpreting and correcting the

934
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:46,300
vulnerabilities found

935
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:49,090
then based on that we need

936
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,950
developers with knowledge of,

937
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,830
say,

938
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:55,670
vulnerabilities to

939
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:58,670
directly correct these, a redundancy

940
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:01,970
then or otherwise

941
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:03,860
a

942
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,780
specialist remediation team is assigned to the vulnerability review is the great

943
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:08,660
dilemma those who review the reports

944
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:11,030
who writes the knowledge to

945
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:13,670
correct those vulnerabilities ok, nice

946
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:15,740
from sarkozy, lots of very

947
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:18,080
interesting tools but they have the network, they

948
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,000
correct the vulnerabilities and make

949
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,910
sure that since this that that

950
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,280
product the software is

951
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,620
completely sanitized well my time

952
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,950
is up that is a  little what  I wanted to share a

953
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:31,700
lot with you, thank you for your attention,

954
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,730
sorry for the speed, I am not

955
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:37,060
attentive to the questions and doubts, but

956
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:39,480
there is

957
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:43,369
thanks for your participation, Juan, this

958
00:42:43,369 --> 00:42:46,160
is a very interesting talk and

959
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,760
there are definitely no major challenges

960
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,010
for the development teams in

961
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:55,670
regards to  cybersecurity issues

962
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:57,650
well now we have to go to the round of

963
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:59,900
questions we have the first question

964
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:04,339
that comes from jason james and more questions will

965
00:43:04,339 --> 00:43:08,770
talisman work in nature the box

966
00:43:09,249 --> 00:43:12,440
what happens is that it only depends on him

967
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:15,049
specifically on talisman ok

968
00:43:15,049 --> 00:43:18,019
that does not depend on him  In other words, from the

969
00:43:18,019 --> 00:43:21,019
repository where you push ok, it

970
00:43:21,019 --> 00:43:23,420
actually depends on the

971
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:26,119
developer's machine because where the

972
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:28,219
environments where I study,

973
00:43:28,219 --> 00:43:29,920
the developments work, do not work for me with Linux,

974
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,720
so let's say that

975
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,990
if the platform is

976
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,770
developers they will not have problems

977
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:41,740
because if  It is windows and if it really

978
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:44,410
does not hurt me to say it no no I do not know

979
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:46,180
if it works, say  s about windows it

980
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:50,609
would not be necessary to check the

981
00:43:50,609 --> 00:43:53,170
correct compatibility with here I have other questions

982
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:57,250
the intern ask me what advice would

983
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:59,470
you give to the developers to increase

984
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:03,118
their knowledge of cybersecurity

985
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,520
good question agreement actually in the

986
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,400
background comes from the pops and from the cecop

987
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,010
although this  for ten or

988
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:14,589
fifteen years the 20 years from which we are

989
00:44:14,589 --> 00:44:16,539
already talking about security issues

990
00:44:16,539 --> 00:44:18,369
since the internet was invented

991
00:44:18,369 --> 00:44:20,920
practically in agreement then in

992
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,260
reality and it is the same tonic it is not and it

993
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,569
is also rescued a little what what

994
00:44:25,569 --> 00:44:28,480
came  In this one,

995
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,780
those who had been speaking in my

996
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:35,810
previous ones, let's say colleagues,

997
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:39,020
I cannot defend but attack the

998
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:41,230
agreement, that is, I cannot correct

999
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:44,840
vulnerabilities if I do not know how they work

1000
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,240


1001
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,390
, you agree, that is, depending on the

1002
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:53,070
development teams and this, let's say.

1003
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:57,820
know how it is that an x css is

1004
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,250
exploited according to know common sql injection

1005
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:02,830
a session hijacking is

1006
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:05,390
exploited according to

1007
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:07,880
in the friend with developer know

1008
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,730
that then when you see that in a

1009
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:13,250
report of these tools that are

1010
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:16,310
increasingly being sent faster and more

1011
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:19,490
powerful they will be able to know let's say and

1012
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:21,470
realize the levels of exploiting it

1013
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:24,610
ok and be able to correct them

1014
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:29,390
then but if not me  They talk about an x ss

1015
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:32,150
and let's say I don't know the flat and only

1016
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:33,950
doctor let's say I know the code and

1017
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:36,620
suddenly I correct it there but at the time that

1018
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:38,900
it passes through you it comes out again

1019
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,730
because I did not correct well then there

1020
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:42,590
where the problems are generated that

1021
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:45,220
then  Yes, but from the

1022
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:48,110
developer errors and so on, but let's say

1023
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:49,880
that I learned I develop my development roles

1024
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,200
because now I have to have

1025
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,260
security, okay, so yes, but

1026
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:56,000
actually before there was development of

1027
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,650
developers and infrastructure

1028
00:45:57,650 --> 00:46:00,290
and now there are an agreement for apps then.

1029
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:02,330
this is migrating and it is going to continue

1030
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:05,540
looking in agreement then this one as this one is

1031
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:08,560
called

1032
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:11,670
and it is going to continue migrating and it is and that is the

1033
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:13,859
high competition that  e today

1034
00:46:13,859 --> 00:46:15,210
developers and everything we

1035
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:18,359
need to these

1036
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:21,450
application development issues we faced not a long time ago we

1037
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:23,010
did not talk about doca nico

1038
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:25,349
really I am we already talked about turbines and

1039
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:27,450
I have to learn a lot with the agreement

1040
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:29,730
so that is part of natural evolution

1041
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:32,030


1042
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:33,460
Yes, definitely

1043
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:36,190
security and safety issues have

1044
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:39,200
to be transversal to all the

1045
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,060
implementations that will be made in what

1046
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:44,600
this system is, they will not reach

1047
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:48,620
the next question and it is from fp fred

1048
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:50,270
asks some developers

1049
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:52,210
use the geo tool and for there

1050
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:55,000
talisman applies

1051
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,910
of  Today

1052
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:59,610
yes, but it would be more a second layer of

1053
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:02,310
agreement, that is to say in the end according to what

1054
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:04,590
I have seen of geo and it is with me, that is, they do

1055
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:06,750
not see me, I am not going so much the tool

1056
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:11,400
but to what it does ok then this

1057
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,800
could apply could get into the  of the

1058
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,050
flow I perceived as a second layer of

1059
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:18,780
agreement, we would have to say it would have

1060
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,550
to be seen well in mind that if my

1061
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:23,010
tool let's say it meets the objective

1062
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:25,260
from pre comics so I don't need,

1063
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,960
let's say a second layer, let's say a

1064
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,030
review of the tool that it

1065
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:32,040
uses, ok, because it was said, we don't

1066
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,530
stay in the tool.

1067
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:36,960


1068
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,210


1069
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:41,670
from pre comics that is

1070
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:44,430
what talisman covers and so there may

1071
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:46,200
be a lot of other tools what

1072
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,750
it does is verify that we say the

1073
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:51,960
keys and the and everything that is

1074
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,900
credential keys etc. etc. they do not pass

1075
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:57,900
in plain text to my

1076
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,850
central repository if I have  Another tool that

1077
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:01,230
does the same then I am already

1078
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:03,440
complying and alfre comics

1079
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,630
then it is going to happen there

1080
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:10,220
that is when I have the next

1081
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:13,190
question that Rodham

1082
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,140
asks us what tools for

1083
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:18,200
vulnerability testing or paragliding team do you

1084
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,290
recommend

1085
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:23,710
because there are many to roll up, so

1086
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:26,470
there are  many, for example, and today

1087
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,810


1088
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:31,510
those with flat integration are taking advantage of,

1089
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:33,750
for example,

1090
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:36,630
compared  I would not like products

1091
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:38,790
but let's say that compared for example

1092
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:41,910
open vázquez that nobody liked at the beginning

1093
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:45,600
I remember today it is not

1094
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,370
the best tool but it does have

1095
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:49,140
many edges that are integrated for

1096
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:50,730
example with james kingston with another

1097
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:53,160
tool of de  continue

1098
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:56,220
placement ok then just for that

1099
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,270
fact

1100
00:48:57,270 --> 00:49:00,090
let's say it gives an added plus

1101
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:02,250
ok i dont know if it is the best ok

1102
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:04,260
later i could talk about it say

1103
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:08,340
qualys nexus and other things ok but

1104
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:11,910
i repeat that it can't be

1105
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:14,010
done when it was done  A bridge is

1106
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:15,660
that beyond the issue from

1107
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:16,800
rolling up a single

1108
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,440
tool was used several are used ok because you

1109
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,480
need to see the different

1110
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:25,500
perspectives of let's say the objective is

1111
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,300
that you are evaluating because one can

1112
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,580
remove one thing and another can remove another

1113
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:32,250
vulnerability x which one do you stay  you

1114
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:35,490
stay with only one you do not have to see

1115
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:37,500
that report and the

1116
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:40,620
concise universe analysis reports agree they

1117
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:43,140
are all concise nobody  It tells you ok ready this

1118
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:45,360
vulnerable xs existence how to

1119
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,719
exploit it no

1120
00:49:47,719 --> 00:49:50,579
and true we do not owe each other as they say

1121
00:49:50,579 --> 00:49:52,380
marry a certain tool

1122
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:54,809
number is no longer correct it will not be

1123
00:49:54,809 --> 00:49:57,900
limited and many times it will be very it

1124
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,329
will be given our results and what

1125
00:50:00,329 --> 00:50:02,339
I do  I can obtain from the reports that

1126
00:50:02,339 --> 00:50:05,369
you are providing us with not many

1127
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:07,200
free code tools also

1128
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,779
this one precisely by its nature this

1129
00:50:09,779 --> 00:50:12,180
does not publish the source code and I think that

1130
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:13,219
programming skills

1131
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:15,359
are definitely very necessary to

1132
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:17,279
make these small adjustments many times

1133
00:50:17,279 --> 00:50:19,170
not to limit ourselves precisely  To the

1134
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:20,729
capabilities at that time have the

1135
00:50:20,729 --> 00:50:22,829
tool yes and if that is very

1136
00:50:22,829 --> 00:50:24,749
important and there is a key point let's say

1137
00:50:24,749 --> 00:50:27,180
no what we review to security and what they

1138
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:29,849
handle from that reprogramming that they

1139
00:50:29,849 --> 00:50:31,499
see or that we come what we have learned

1140
00:50:31,499 --> 00:50:34,440
let's say there is a lot of advantage with respect to  to

1141
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,499
that put the other the other visibility and

1142
00:50:37,499 --> 00:50:39,809
not so much of the closed box let's say to

1143
00:50:39,809 --> 00:50:41,999
make them a seer that evaluates  úan or if not

1144
00:50:41,999 --> 00:50:43,440
we can also have the ability to

1145
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,869
review code to be able to do it today for as

1146
00:50:45,869 --> 00:50:47,549
it was said today that has changed a

1147
00:50:47,549 --> 00:50:51,079
lot and not only ok I have a plan

1148
00:50:51,079 --> 00:50:53,130
let's say a lot of tools that

1149
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:55,190
make security religion

1150
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:58,880
to the perfect but you know how to say  from

1151
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,790
reviewing that are those vulnerabilities or

1152
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:03,440
that it is already telling me that

1153
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,240
the life of that already has time but of the 10

1154
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,880
all are correct are the

1155
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,089
portability levels are say they are correct or it

1156
00:51:11,089 --> 00:51:12,980
is vulnerable or they are simply false

1157
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:16,190
positives or suddenly it does not exist

1158
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:18,589
Suddenly the scenario exploded as I tell you

1159
00:51:18,589 --> 00:51:22,310
many times today they require a

1160
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:25,010
too specific scenario to be exploited

1161
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:27,589
so the risk levels are very

1162
00:51:27,589 --> 00:51:30,079
low then but nevertheless many

1163
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,780
times ok they do not pass in

1164
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:35,750
vulnerability analysis like this one as

1165
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:37,700
vulnerabilities let's say very high

1166
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:40,099
when  actually the

1167
00:51:40,099 --> 00:51:41,839
personal evaluation and the evaluation of the

1168
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:45,120
specialist have to go beyond

1169
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,050
definitely and  the very important human factor

1170
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:51,780
of the analysis in the

1171
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:54,770
end

1172
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:57,020
well we have the following question which

1173
00:51:57,020 --> 00:52:00,020
is from rafael woman he asks us the

1174
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:02,270
teaching of basic programming in

1175
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:04,280
institutes and universities are factors

1176
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,900
responsible for the conare skills

1177
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:09,320
in web applications how can it improve

1178
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,580
how can it be improved  This well,

1179
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:15,370
in reality I did not say the fault of

1180
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:17,670
agreement that is, it would not be very

1181
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:20,800
irresponsible but no no no no I could not

1182
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,990
abide by that let's say actually even

1183
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:24,730
the development framework has

1184
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:28,240
vulnerabilities that is, they are not donuts

1185
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,670
as programs to send obviously not

1186
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:33,220
a  Obviously, not a factor but in

1187
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:35,200
reality it is this and even the

1188
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,290
development brakes, that is, I will not be

1189
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:41,160
able to talk about names but in reality

1190
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:44,200
to go to the improvement obviously it is what

1191
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:47,410
we started is what we started to

1192
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:50,140
talk from the beginning that is already  The

1193
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:52,720
migrated competencies are already more

1194
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,130
complex, it is not enough for me to just

1195
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:56,710
develop to know how to develop in the will

1196
00:52:56,710 --> 00:53:00,370
see in calling and ter  oo in spring

1197
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:03,010
okay I don't also have to know is

1198
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:05,590
that I knew more than vulnerabilities

1199
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:08,710
let's say I could find in my development

1200
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:11,020
because then and apply best

1201
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:13,840
development practices so as not to fall into

1202
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,940
those vulnerabilities so easily

1203
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:18,220
now the resources do a

1204
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:21,580
quite commendable job today for example for  the

1205
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:24,850
revolution of that before let's say that

1206
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:25,800
like

1207
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:29,260
78 years ago suddenly it was very easy to

1208
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:32,230
find problems in the boeing of the

1209
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:34,360
fingers applications in the

1210
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:37,660
user fumet password agreed they were super

1211
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:39,520
easy and we are going to find problems

1212
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,220
there because nobody put the focus there  or it

1213
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:45,400
was not known that they stopped it

1214
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,200
when they were so developed that we

1215
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,450
would pay to develop functions

1216
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:52,510
that allow let's say that is safe

1217
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:54,810
today jac

1218
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:57,510
almost let's say it would be quite

1219
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:59,790
irresponsible to find a problem

1220
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:02,220
in the access report of an

1221
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:05,850
application is almost this almost already  It is not

1222
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:07,770
found of that

1223
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:09,930
because obviously they have already known each other more than  and

1224
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:11,970
more documentation of that, there are

1225
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:14,520
frameworks that help a lot so it is

1226
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,190
an evolution of them today more

1227
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:18,540
things are found inside the

1228
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,220
application than outside the application

1229
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:22,280
is not what is always recommended let's say

1230
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:26,070
analysis let's say this analysis of

1231
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:28,440
web applications with credentials and  There,

1232
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,290
how does the eps jacobs issue intervene?

1233
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:33,540


1234
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:35,700


1235
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,380


1236
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:39,200


1237
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,670


1238
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:44,970


1239
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:47,910
It is important as I said

1240
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:50,610
in the conclusions to decide ok

1241
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:53,280
trained my development team or destination a

1242
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,670
team of specialists to see that ok

1243
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:59,580
and the month and entered it within my

1244
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:02,540
work team either directly or

1245
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:04,860
commercialized it is already the model let's say

1246
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,180
defined the  let's say a model of

1247
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:08,430
integration but today developers need to

1248
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:11,010
work

1249
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:13,890
operations people and people and let's say  and the

1250
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:15,990
security people all three have to

1251
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:18,450
work according to a set it is

1252
00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:21,810
difficult if in fact there are two people

1253
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:23,100
to agree on it is complicated

1254
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:25,170
imagine let's say the whole team because

1255
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:28,050
then it is difficult and it is a change in the

1256
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:31,320
way of thinking then but today  For

1257
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,240
today, if we are adopting these types, which

1258
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,160
is the reason behind the talk, this

1259
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:38,580
type of, let's say, ideology, ok

1260
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:39,960
methodology, if you want to call it,

1261
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,730
then I already have to know that we have

1262
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:44,220
to erase those aspects

1263
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:46,510
definitely.

1264
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,700


1265
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:51,370
each one with a

1266
00:55:51,370 --> 00:55:54,040
certain level of specialization in your

1267
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,990
experience, Juan could you tell us

1268
00:55:55,990 --> 00:55:58,480
what are the main problems that

1269
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,180
you have encountered

1270
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:03,830
when these teams work together

1271
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:06,770
because they are not real technicians, they are not

1272
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:08,750
technical

1273
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:11,240
because let's say that each one knows our

1274
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:14,680
user specialist, let's say and

1275
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:18,620
obviously they are more problems  Let's say

1276
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:20,320


1277
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:23,030
training of each, let's say of each

1278
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:26,900
person ok and there I could c  To address the issue

1279
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:27,670
of

1280
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:30,080
universities institutes of agreements, that

1281
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:33,200
is, if this commercial is always appreciated, this one

1282
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,240
and how it is affecting even

1283
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,730
the pandemic as a result of this agreement.

1284
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:41,390


1285
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:45,110


1286
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:48,350
fostered

1287
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:51,890
in teamwork according

1288
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:55,269
to her in environments with more

1289
00:56:55,269 --> 00:56:58,700
professional thoughts where stress stress

1290
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:00,980
and jump because I need to get

1291
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:02,750
the application right now and well the

1292
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:04,160
security agent tells me she is

1293
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,170
not vulnerable she cannot go into production OK

1294
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:08,930
then there  There is more a topic, let's say

1295
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:11,569
at a level, let's say the training of each

1296
00:57:11,569 --> 00:57:14,240
person and people, let's say the biggest

1297
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,809
problem is one, let's say that I have

1298
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:20,960
to say my part of the backroom

1299
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,990
that we say to ourselves below, or that is this

1300
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:26,450
and know that it is not because the  of security

1301
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:28,579
I put on the watch is a t

1302
00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:32,119
-shirt of the security area and this is that it is

1303
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:34,010
stopping the work it is not because in

1304
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:35,329
reality it is not complying with  If she

1305
00:57:35,329 --> 00:57:37,430
presents then I have to say to

1306
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:39,529
have levels of communication and that is

1307
00:57:39,529 --> 00:57:41,960
another thing soft skills in agreement

1308
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,569
to be able to dialogue in some way and to

1309
00:57:44,569 --> 00:57:46,250
sit next to the security is

1310
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:47,750
what I already ready but I have to

1311
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:49,069
improve to this line of code

1312
00:57:49,069 --> 00:57:51,410
promptly already ready  because because this

1313
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:53,539
variable our winding does not have a

1314
00:57:53,539 --> 00:57:55,130
validation function to the list

1315
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:57,740
then I can do it for me as it is

1316
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:58,789
called administration

1317
00:57:58,789 --> 00:58:01,369
I will have a security function

1318
00:58:01,369 --> 00:58:03,979
such simple things but sometimes or it is personal egos

1319
00:58:03,979 --> 00:58:06,109
that is the biggest problem

1320
00:58:06,109 --> 00:58:08,089
and that is  a cultural issue more than anything

1321
00:58:08,089 --> 00:58:11,179
, according to raw no and when in reality

1322
00:58:11,179 --> 00:58:13,279
it is not a personal issue it is an issue of the

1323
00:58:13,279 --> 00:58:15,619
benefit of the company it is also a

1324
00:58:15,619 --> 00:58:17,390
new program for me but rather a program

1325
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:19,959
for the company

1326
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:26,660
and it delves deeper with this type of

1327
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:29,640
change not  From methodology to agreement

1328
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,140
because they require much more coordination

1329
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:33,290
than before.

1330
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:36,560
Right done. Thank you Juan for your

1331
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,840
answers. The interaction has been interesting

1332
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:41,300
