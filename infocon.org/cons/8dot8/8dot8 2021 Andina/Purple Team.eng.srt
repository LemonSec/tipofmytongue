[Music]

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,700
perfect community again we are

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,190
here on the air this time continuing with

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,920
the verses to speak the presentation and

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,890
now we have to introduce antonio

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,500
clares rodríguez that although the

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,330
Venezuelan has been living

8
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,970
in Spain for a long time and which I think is

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,130
due to why we have  So many people from

10
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,670
Spain and Venezuela right so I

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,980
imagine that Antonio is the culprits

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,780
since we have several

13
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,850
followers also from there after this

14
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,370
comment number about Antonio

15
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,920
beyond his nationality because he is

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,780
a cybersecurity architect of the club

17
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,770
for

18
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,710
tokyo for antonio clara from managers

19
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,540
and security and an official computer expert

20
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,870
in computer engineering master's degree

21
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:52,940
in telecommunications law

22
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,739
masters and face-to-face and mother

23

passionate about the world of

25
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,710
cybersecurity and faithfully convinced

26
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,090
that the first  main tool

27
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,069
to strengthen the security of

28
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:06,420
organizations

29
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,520
in  the awareness of the information of the

30
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,549
person so the presentation of

31
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:13,320
today by antonio is given precisely

32
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,649
with the dépor with team security uniting

33
00:01:16,649 --> 00:01:18,840
the reptile and the blooming in an

34
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,360
envelope so antonio left you with the

35
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,460
whole community 8.8 and sportivo the father of the

36
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,170
Another,

37
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,159
thank you very much for the presentation and

38
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,830
thank you very much for the

39
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,150
invitation sometimes when there was already in the

40
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:38,160
presentation that she

41
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,000
is phenomenal and well, nothing

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,409
name me so much about Rodríguez that they won

43
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:46,210
presented and well today I'm going to talk a

44
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:50,250
little about this for you.

45
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,590
I skip the agenda because of the little time

46
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,240
I have but hey, we are not going to

47
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,500
stay in that to understand a little

48
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,540
the concept of for you we need to

49
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,570
know the rating and erectile gluten we are

50
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,920
going to see it as the entertaining

51
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,140
part the cool part the beautiful part  Of

52
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,840
offensive security as such in this case

53
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,369
the rating is those who are responsible for

54
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:10,280
ethical hacking by more than industry or

55
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,930
programs in exploitation campaigns and

56
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,270
well, a lot  or more in the part that

57
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,730
we all like, then we have the blood in

58
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,440
the Latino is the fun part but

59
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,970
the necessary part of the companies

60
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,860
because because they are the ones who are in charge of

61
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,010
everything that is the defense part they

62
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:28,710
are that barrier of  protection that

63
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,360
companies have before any type of

64
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,850
attack, then both teams must

65
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,680
be married, both the rating must be aligned with

66
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,830
each other to define and attack

67
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,660
the company and be able to identify those

68
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,730
security holes as the blue team

69
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,000
hears to be able to stop these all this type

70
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,740
of  attacks and have an adequate response

71
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,940


72
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,610
then well the concept of by cultivation

73
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,310
many people do not see it and many people see

74
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,770
it as well as the box of the city

75
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,570
security the full stack of

76
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,250
cybersecurity and we should not see it that way

77
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,810
we should not see how  a totally

78
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,600
separate team the sting itself is more than all

79
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,270
a transfer of knowledge what

80
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,820
should exist is that fusion of

81
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,310
knowledge between both teams both

82
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,410
teams always d  They must exist,

83
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,210
we are going to make it unclear that he does not come

84
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,920
and they do not want to sell us, hey look,

85
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,600
a person who knows blue team sells you and

86
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,880
knows reptiles bird all this we do not want

87
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,350
a single state of security gentlemen

88
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,480
we want one person we want those two

89
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,270
teams but there is one

90
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,920
fairly fluid communication so that

91
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,810
we can improve communications so

92
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,130
that we can improve but now

93
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,770
detection and defense because because

94
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,330
to know it towards the

95
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,850
previous violence to know a good to a

96
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,560
good defense to be able to protect

97
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,270
the company well without knowing the attack as

98
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:46,020
such  So he himself

99
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,630
wants this fusion of knowledge in

100
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:52,110
terms of I know how you defend yourself

101
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,450
as we love you but I am going to attack

102
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,850
a company and as a reagent, it is already with

103
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,020
the company to have to go hand in hand

104
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,090
with bluetooth  to tell you hey let's go

105
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,370
I'm going to use this new

106
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,650
exploit you just have a vulnerability

107
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,750
the windows investment nightmare

108
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,459
this way it is  As I exploit it, we are

109
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:11,799
going to see it a little later on

110
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:13,569
how this is exploited, it already has it, it

111
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:15,010
always has to be aware of the

112
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,738
sky.If I like your technique, we are going to

113
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:20,978
see how I can stop that is

114
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:23,010
exploit of  What form do I have and what to

115
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,270
stop it then once the blue

116
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,330
team knows that technique and there I gave the

117
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,370
Houthi hey look at the rating hey look

118
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,400
I already know how to stop it is the exploit

119
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,320
I already know how to stop the service so that

120
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,600
no one can access now  Let's

121
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,610
see how you can overcome those

122
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,800
barriers that I am putting for you at that

123
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,600
time there when we want that

124
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,520
communication to be so fluid I have been

125
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,070
on both sides and reptilian

126
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,449
never spoke with bluetooth but

127
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:51,340
has simply reached the

128
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,900
work site exploded the company the most

129
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,240
fun here paka paka paka explore

130
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,830
I'm inside he raised privileges and all

131
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,350
this is already home but what about the

132
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,880
blue team the loot arrives and starts like this

133
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,770
today wait they entered through  here is all

134
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,770
post morten as such

135
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,050
learning but once the

136
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,879
techniques have already been used then what

137
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:11,400
we want is hey you already know these

138
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,560
cutting edge techniques for the

139
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,539
offensive security part

140
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:17,970
cutting edge techniques to stop the defensive part

141
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,440
later we will go  showing

142
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,289
some more than everything I am not going to base the

143
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:24,509
presentation on cyber kilstein which are

144
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:26,970
the phases of how an

145
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,729
attacker would do it in terms of the recognition of

146
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,590
a company because he is not going to attack something

147
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,360
without knowing it we are going to first make

148
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,400
a good recognition and power  exploit

149
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,009
that is that vulnerability that finds

150
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:40,710
that weakness as such I also said it

151
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,569
in handling the previous ones that I was

152
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:44,340
seeing is what is the entry point they

153
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,409
hear many times we say I have a

154
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:48,659
zero day and we sell it to a company like

155
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:50,460
me, you are not going to martín  like a day zero

156
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,440
means zeros you want your employee

157
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,810
because because through that fishing is the one

158
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,250
with which I am going to enter the

159
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,349
company, it is simply going to  Being able to give

160
00:05:58,349 --> 00:06:00,750
an email or falsify a web page

161
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,849
for it to be inside has shown

162
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:05,069
lately that all the attacks and

163
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:06,719
all the attacks that have been that have

164
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:09,030
had enough force, for example

165
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:12,309
the oil pipeline is low and all this has not

166
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:13,869
been through a  Day zero has been

167
00:06:13,869 --> 00:06:15,399
through phishing attacks that this

168
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:18,839
person has downloaded a file that is not

169
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:21,629
malicious as such and good to the

170
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:24,729
house then I am going to share the

171
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:27,759
presentation with you, it will be the rise of

172
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,319
melinka and beni, who is antonio claret

173
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:32,229
rodríguez, so that  You have it because

174
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:33,459
because it is the presentation of put

175
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,569
because there will not be time to explain

176
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:36,460
each

177
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,530
of the tools and there are many

178
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,090
who already want to show them and that

179
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,819
so that we can see them in what way I as an

180
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,460
attacker I can just attack

181
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,220
the company  in an ethical way it should be noted

182
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,349
then the first step is the

183
00:06:50,349 --> 00:06:52,060
recognition in the recognition I am going

184
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,050
to do

185
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,300
that would be tools to use

186
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,979
google hacking the hack  ing and we are going to

187
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:59,050
see that it has a home vaccine, it

188
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,509
sounds a lot in terms of looking for something some

189
00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:04,180
little things that can help me in looking for

190
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,669
a free port not in looking for something in

191
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:09,580
something additional the room we are going to go

192
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,210
into why

193
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,360
if today a little quick forgive  but

194
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,310
here it is we are going to bring first steps

195
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,490
and here we have I put it for example

196
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,950
I now what I want to look for the 435

197
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,660
because because I know a vulnerability

198
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,180
is left by room 135 which is the

199
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,670
vulnerability known as a nightmare

200
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,080
impression so here it is going to show me

201
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,360
that they exist  two million 447 thousand

202
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,040
results means that these two

203
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,380
million

204
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,720
machines have that port 30 135

205
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,470
open to the

206
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,660
quite handsome one another of the

207
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,940
things that I want to serve me

208
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,780
is

209
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,790
to find servers to find all

210
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,670
kinds of ports to find services

211
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,650
for  see this type of thing here I can

212
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,740
choose and measure through port 5

213
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,270
554 show me all the cameras in the

214
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,040
country of Spain these are cameras  s that

215
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,780
are currently live at 6:28 in

216
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,370
the afternoon are cameras that do not have

217
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,800
any type of

218
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,780
password or anything and well those are the

219
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,510
type of things like that starts well

220
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,800
here I am as straight I can already say

221
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,130
that the current dam enters  There I am

222
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,770
seeing what you can do because it is not

223
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,330
so easy but hey, let's keep in mind

224
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:28,240
that although we have already seen that part, the

225
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,650
other thing that we do as a

226
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,799
requiem that makes the rating as such is to

227
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,130
identify the relationship of trust that

228
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,380
exists between various services in  In this

229
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,640
case we have these

230
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,770
I am going to place my company this

231
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,059
tool that is quite beautiful because

232
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:45,470
because this tool you place the

233
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,570
domain and it will tell us all the

234
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,810
trust relationships that exist for

235
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,420
this domain with what sense with the

236
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,920
sense that I work in Tokyo  It is there

237
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,630
and nobody enters here because because

238
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,850
I have a hell of a security but what

239
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:03,190
happens that I can have a subdomain

240
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:06,710
without seeing an old subdomain that today they

241
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,050
are or we do not create them p  or a

242
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,880
football game that we did

243
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,040
not believe in his domain, Tokyo cult football,

244
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,380
and we left it abandoned, that is

245
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,940
a security breach, it is one of the

246
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,650
layers through which an attacker could

247
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,770
enter us or

248
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:23,650
identify each of these

249
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,880
of this  another and all these

250
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,740
services shame to know who of them has

251
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,940
any vulnerability to do so,

252
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,920
take advantage of it and take advantage of

253
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,930
that relationship of trust that exists

254
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,720
to

255
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,180
make my domain

256
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,560
good, we have others, we also have

257
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,500
the part of xaki that was the part

258
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,509
here that is  just what I was

259
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:46,689
saying has quite a few commands,

260
00:09:46,689 --> 00:09:49,349
quite alone

261
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,660
among them, we have here I am going to look for a

262
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,370
command that I no longer had I had seen

263
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:57,290
that it seemed quite interesting to

264
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,890
me because it does not want to show it to me well for a

265
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,110
moment we do not like the shipment but hey

266
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,560
we want  here with him and I'm going to leave here for

267
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,640
a moment because I want to show you

268
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,610
to work as I commented in leaving the

269
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,100
links and here so that you can try what  e look for

270
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,740
their companies and they can do it,

271
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,870
they can change here the type of things

272
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,790
they want to consult and that here what we

273
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,100
have is in this case I want to find

274
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,890
that google filters me everything

275
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:32,190
through

276
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,200
I explained everything that I say restrictive

277
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,690
and  Let it be of pages that are documents

278
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,640
that are government pages, well it has

279
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,310
shown me here 49 results, I will not

280
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,870
enter because its rigid art has

281
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,089
to be for something, but well, as I already told you,

282
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:47,950
I have left here quite a lot of

283
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:51,550
console to be able to play with  it and to

284
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,490
be able to see it

285
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,339
because then the recognition we already see

286
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,380
we are able to identify the

287
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,490
open ports we are able to identify

288
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,890
which applications and with whom they have a

289
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,630
trust relationship additionally

290
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,330
also give me shows the

291
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,850
services of the servers in the name

292
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,410
what it is for us  using a psp 7

293
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,230
using an apache but now it shows

294
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,480
me as blood in what do I have to

295
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,790
do to prevent that today is the main

296
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,980
thing  just create the navigation letter and

297
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,810
who is entering who is

298
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,160
looking for the sawyer member all the

299
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,500
second reduce the

300
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,730
visible information the visible information when I say

301
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:30,060
reduce it is simply to stop or change

302
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,820
that in the headers of our

303
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,470
browsers in the header of our

304
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,720
servers but  we do not send that it does not send

305
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,370
the name of the server or simply

306
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,660
change the name of the server to be

307
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,500
able to put it says hide to make it a little

308
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,640
more difficult

309
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,350
the attacker today exists a lot to Crist

310
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,000
killing and we will see that with

311
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,070
just seven clicks I can be second

312
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:53,940
in  a victim computer does not need to

313
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,640
be a nasa hackers, followed by a

314
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,110
hundred, only know the

315
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,120
precise commands and the specific tool that

316
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,040
already do everything for me to access the

317
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,900
company that is why one of the things

318
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,460
that today we see that has been

319
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,620
multiplied in an exponential way

320
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,500
the attacks is by this type of

321
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,490
tool that is on par with everything and

322
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:14,220
that does not have the secu  The

323
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,930
other thing would be to delete directories and their

324
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,640
obsolete domains, we have already seen it because

325
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,340
this page is also not going to tell us the

326
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,560
internet until now because you register

327
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,600
the domain and it will tell you from the

328
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,070
moment the domain was created all

329
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,690
the updates it has had

330
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,430
That is why I play that at some point some

331
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,500
security breach the 4 and see if it is

332
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,560


333
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,500
possibly exploitable at the moment and the others

334
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,790
of course close the

335
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,260
administration doors if I place

336
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,230
port 22 port 3 089 arrive they will be surprised

337
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,930
but now millions is like the previous

338
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,130
millions  of ports 39 open and

339
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,270
possibly with the default key

340
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,520
now well once we

341
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,940
have all the recognition part

342
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,730
and I am seeing the time that I had left

343
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,910
now what we have to do is choose that weapon to

344
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,320
disarm it as such then in that

345
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,260
we have here to  the rating team

346
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,120
we have to create the country I am going to set it

347
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,040
up being manuel serrat software believes

348
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,140
infecting a boy a clone file  r

349
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,730
site whatever you decide from the

350
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,560
way as input in the deficit people such

351
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,110
as the blocks we have simply

352
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,390
tree the first defense of my company

353
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,279
has to be that firewall so that it

354
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:23,690
blocks all kinds of

355
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,730
incorrect requests then if I have the web page

356
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:28,490
a web server have  always a web uav

357
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,320
available so that it is able to

358
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,450
identify all that type of

359
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,400
injection and fast command and it will do it for me time

360
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,560
and that one that detects me and an ips so that

361
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,910
it stops me everything that it measures to escape

362
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,000
always having a good

363
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
like

364
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,580
an antivirus with steroids and this is good

365
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,700
this comes and malware and processes are

366
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,340
alone because there is a process that they do not

367
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,740
know will identify this process

368
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,380
I do not know it we are going to skip it I am

369
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,360
doing the demo with windows 100 is to

370
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,040
present at all times the defense of the

371
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,200
axis of advance that does not happen that does not happen is

372
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,610
that it does not happen that does not happen if in the end I had

373
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:08,730
to pull windows 7 because no it did

374
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,700
not allow me then we have update

375
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,620
of course  Or we have to update everything

376
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,390
in the garden and walks because

377
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,580
because currently we have a

378
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,350
house like hares

379
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,510
that we are running as who

380
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,120
says

381
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,820
as soon as the vulnerability comes out

382
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,560
that we have to have the

383
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,440
good patch we are going with that race in

384
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,650
2017 left us a good learning with

385
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,300
good cry when they told us in

386
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,390
microsoft please update that there is

387
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,190
a serious vulnerability of

388
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:44,640
remote code execution of 445 the play already exists

389
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,260
the explorer is in meta explore is already

390
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,540
in empire please update your

391
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,700
colista list  many people said ok did not

392
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,730
update wanna cry made disasters in

393
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,170
all in all places on the planet

394
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,750
why because simply people did not

395
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:01,650
update good here to choose the weapon

396
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,400
here I am going to do a little demo so

397
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,440
the monkey effect does not fail and I am going to go  a

398
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,050
bit running so

399
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:13,140
here what this tool was saying here

400
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,499
is

401
00:15:14,499 --> 00:15:17,199
until we have here what

402
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,169
social gender tools means what it gives us are

403
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,699
going  There are several options, the first option is

404
00:15:21,699 --> 00:15:23,139
because you want to do I want to do a

405
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:25,869
social engineering attack. It is the most

406
00:15:25,869 --> 00:15:27,989
seen today that I want to make you

407
00:15:27,989 --> 00:15:29,859
want to be what is here in

408
00:15:29,859 --> 00:15:31,389
social energy.

409
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:32,739
Attack is going to

410
00:15:32,739 --> 00:15:34,719
be a web page number two that

411
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:36,399
you want to do with that web page well

412
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,619
I want to make a web here the same, you are active

413
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:40,680
more than cloning a web

414
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,800
and of course here I have to clone a web this

415
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,970
intention

416
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:48,810
in my ip address tell me which is which

417
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:52,379
is the  ip the person

418
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:54,819
who is the one who wants to explore well I

419
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:58,378
want to clone

420
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,000
this page of this logic page and it is sent

421
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,250
through physics to

422
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:11,110
someone we are going to paste it here

423
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,839
then ok I have cloned the page

424
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,730
send it to the person now it remains

425
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,920
The skill of the attacker as such in

426
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,709
creating is in creating that church of having

427
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:22,899
that Machiavellian mind and saying

428
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,250
how I am going to get this

429
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,649
person so that the person clicks

430
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:28,300
but comes up with a lot of  click on the

431
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,120
page but simply place in the

432
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,890
real evans download or you can just

433
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,959
use a shortener can use some

434
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,360
page some other web page that directs me to

435
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,220
a

436
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:44,010
real page that has a

437
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,140
click here which is like who says we

438
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,800
have a click on top of the

439
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,510
transparent framework  of the page has not

440
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,420
caused enough but it is what it does as such

441
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,450
to create this physical nothing I here

442
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,540
see here leaves by point loy and lies

443
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,310
this is my web page that has been created here

444
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,750
the user is going to say good since he

445
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,660
placed me and  My password of which it

446
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,829
is

447
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:10,949
I connect I do not connect or half an error

448
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:12,659
but we see that it sends me

449
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:14,760
to the page instead of the legal page when seeing this

450
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,500
good and the system and the person as

451
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,230
well would place it is but and again it

452
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,849
is difficult I have here  your

453
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:24,319
admin and pasqual credentials to the page that

454
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,569
you have already put then we see the simplicity

455
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:30,240
with which a physical is created today

456
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,779
I did not take 30 seconds we see it

457
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:36,059
quite clear I can also create a

458
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:37,740
stable not having more to see what it does

459
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,350
is poison these types of files for

460
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,730
this create now I treat me with some

461
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,830
kind of exploit that once the person

462
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:47,340
executes it say hello it is already

463
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,320
inside d

464
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,480
it is already inside the machine as  I said

465
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,799
before it is in the attacker's expertise

466
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,880
when the expertise arrived is the

467
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,370
yamaha matrix nothing more than everything to say

468
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,480
hey this time I am going to create an

469
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,159
infected file for you or I am going to create something for you I

470
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,730
am going to create here in this bale cow  paca

471
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:14,200
if it looks

472
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,699
good sometimes

473
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,430
a moment of silence

474
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:29,110
good I want you to stay with the

475
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,510
command of the platform what I want

476
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,550
is to enter a country take an interpreter with

477
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,320
a type of kilo jazz that has several

478
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,240
things inside I want you to want me

479
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,520
a reverse communication towards  My children,

480
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,510
what is it, is not the ip of me from my candida,

481
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,650
this street that I am using through

482
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:47,680
port 4 848 and that this is called point

483
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,610
I did not kill it point to run it

484
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:55,750
on the impact of that and okay here I

485
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,350
have it I'm going  to the sea is how

486
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,210
I was saying how I do now so that the person

487
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,490
falls well and that I leave it to your

488
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,740
imagination I simply show you

489
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,010
here how it is easy to create

490
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:11,340
success this one

491
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:24,310
how this easy to create it and how it is

492
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,980
easy to access the

493
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,340
service then of course I here you  I

494
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,070
send through an email, hey

495
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,380
, I have not downloaded this

496
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,270
application that is brutal to mine

497
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:40,270
currency to mine bitcoin it will generate

498
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,070
a hash with the leave then you go into

499
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,550
finance and it will give you

500
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:48,180
the money as for example the person  he is going

501
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,600
to say hey at least the sending is not

502
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,760
to several people a thousand people some

503
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,970
race

504
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,580
with him

505
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,680
we are going to see what

506
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,610
carvalho

507
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,910
believe me that once he has that

508
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,020
file I can do it but

509
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:18,210
because I do not know why not some kind of

510
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,760
error

511
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,030
he

512
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:24,050
[Music]

513
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,110
every

514
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:29,020
so often I'm going to pass it on later with another

515
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,630
example so what he wanted to

516
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,120
do here was inject some kind of

517
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,130
malicious file and once the person

518
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,929
executes it I just put  My

519
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:40,770
cali machine listens and people

520
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:43,299
executed it, it did nothing to it, what I

521
00:20:43,299 --> 00:20:45,670
promised about it, the discs know, but I

522
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:48,070
'm inside it, it's a machine,

523
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,330
so this is how it says this is the

524
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,429
part, one of the most important parts

525
00:20:51,429 --> 00:20:54,370
in the phases the attack phases because

526
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,620
because it is when I have to think

527
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,740
about how I am going to enter

528
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:02,029
that machine

529
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:04,820
then we have the delivery I have already thought about

530
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,469
all this we say today is now in

531
00:21:06,469 --> 00:21:08,929
what form I am going to send it today

532
00:21:08,929 --> 00:21:10,190
You can see it through an email

533
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,960
attached to an infected site but I

534
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,279
do not know the users with I went to if I

535
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:18,440
know it I do not know the users the

536
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,969
company go look we have here two

537
00:21:19,969 --> 00:21:21,889
tools enough water to adjust

538
00:21:21,889 --> 00:21:23,869
how much it has gone that hunter point I

539
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:28,350
simply put  here the domain

540
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:31,070
we are going to place the coca-cola

541
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:34,070
exit

542
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,380
we achieved the domain sex.com and it will

543
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,810
tell us hey you have here

544
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:43,879
123 possible results of

545
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:53,770
course sorry is that I had already

546
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,820
done the test I was already achieved

547
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,350
Of course because that is one of the things that they

548
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,700
throw away, you are logged in and it is totally

549
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:06,350
free so I can only imagine you

550
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,970
for statistics and for stealing our

551
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:10,340
data but here we want to put

552
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,250
the domain and here it will tell us

553
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:15,380
that the 93 emails we have of  This

554
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,300
pepsico domain what we do with this of

555
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,000
course to whom is going to tell it where

556
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,460
this domain has found so that

557
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:26,360
for that attacker can what displays he

558
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,370
looks at here I am not saying it

559
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,960
characterizes you to attack to defend eye

560
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,630
but for more than everything that  If we are and

561
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,850
we have some type of company, let's put

562
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,679
our prey here and if we discover that

563
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:39,679
these officers exist, we eliminate them

564
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,570
quickly, but well here, what we

565
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:45,110
do is I already have the domain, I can

566
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,520
create, hey, look, you have entered this

567
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,350
page, write to the person for  Please

568
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:51,050
to unsubscribe click here

569
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,270
the other one we have is to leave this one they

570
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:56,000
did not like now we will have

571
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
sounded a lot of harvester it is a

572
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,670
tool also for  search emails

573
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,860
accounts of email accounts and that is

574
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,120
quite easy to use

575
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,030
we simply put let you see - h since it

576
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,740
will tell us hey what you want to do

577
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,050
the domain the limit of what you want to

578
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:14,030
search then what I did was

579
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:17,800
place  It will be

580
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,740
- t which is the domain minus l look

581
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,980
for me if one is searched in google and here what

582
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,840
you are going to do is look for the first

583
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,610
action searches that contain the

584
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:31,010
cocacola bolton domain in google and of

585
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,870
course thinking to perform the search

586
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,900
should go a little  a little faster we can

587
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,360
search in google the linkedin in bingen

588
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,800
whatever it is and well here it will tell us

589
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,160
that in google found these three

590
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,650
these scores are useless because

591
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:47,300
when we see it

592
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,520
from info contact contests but well

593
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,380
let's stay that for  Our company or

594
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,640
for the company that we want to

595
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,040
do is attractive, we can make use of

596
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,960
these and social engineering, gentlemen,

597
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:03,210
well,

598
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,190
the other thing we have in the exploitation is

599
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,080
the most fun part.  A is to exploit that

600
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,720
explorer to look for a vulnerability a

601
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,909
port

602
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:12,799
445 open

603
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,270
enough the coast today to exploit our

604
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,490
the

605
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:19,409
funniest part today and I skipped the defense part,

606
00:24:19,409 --> 00:24:21,929
person here in the defense part,

607
00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:24,570
the only thing that I would leave it would be

608
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:27,390
in training and awareness, gentlemen, no

609
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:31,110
open any strange mail as well as

610
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,399
we do not open the door of our house to

611
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:34,110
a stranger who touches us and I want to

612
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,419
pass it nothing for ducks you are the

613
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:38,130
football of your house we are going to think the

614
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,720
same as our computers and our

615
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,460
press we are going to do our  football and

616
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,470
any type of person who wants

617
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:46,409
to start here, not

618
00:24:46,409 --> 00:24:48,570
constant monitoring because because I do not want to

619
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,860
have that monitoring because there

620
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,270
is always someone who will let the

621
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,840
person pass and use flavor to

622
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,890
identify an anomaly in the network

623
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,529
and stop it  stop him in time we will continue

624
00:24:58,529 --> 00:25:01,950
with apart from him as he said explode

625
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,480
here we have these tools that are

626
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,669
quite pretty quite useful  which are

627
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:08,490
the player method in which it already has a

628
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:10,980
number of exploits generated so that we

629
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,990
do not have to invent the wheel to go

630
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,520
for it what we want to do on a

631
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,150
zero day or some kind of this to

632
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,400
prevent it, the exploits we are

633
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,200
famously required to say  before

634
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,300
antivirus with steroids that is going to

635
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,270
stop me that process that unknown

636
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,100
says hears that the micro a process and no

637
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,590
point was not no sir how to read is only

638
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,330
to know what it is going to say because you want to

639
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,640
achieve that you are doing there who

640
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,559
wants to execute a  dll and the one

641
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:42,090
that does not exist or I want to modify

642
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,190
some of the windows some of it

643
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,290
some application some library so

644
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:48,320
that it skips it and ends up

645
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,630
doing it sir that is not only with me it

646
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,850
is quite good it is something that has

647
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:56,100
tried it has done  enough with

648
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,410
different to see and it has not stopped us

649
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:00,090
enough that yes we have already achieved by

650
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:03,059
walking it is not clear that the

651
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:04,860
law was created, the cover is created but it helps us a

652
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:10,639
lot to stick to the protection layer

653
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,490
and well nothing that the exploitation part

654
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:16,340
wanted to lower yes

655
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:20,080
if we let me be here quickly

656
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,940
well a esplai does not go this is quite

657
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,710
basic this as it says 2 of primary

658
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:27,110
but here what we want what I want to

659
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:30,080
be is that I with only six commands

660
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,090
there are  command gentlemen that the expert feve

661
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,370
I do not choose the windows platform to put on

662
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:35,919


663
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,179
this girl is like who says puts

664
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,890
some type of variants there the code

665
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,990
so that well it does not detect it exists and it

666
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:46,130
detects it and the wii had to download

667
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:49,039
a file mind because  if not,

668
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,690
what am I going to do?

669
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:53,390


670
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:56,840


671
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,429


672
00:26:58,429 --> 00:27:01,460


673
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:04,490
the

674
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,440
point on my computer I am simply going

675
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,909
to poison it I am going to become a

676
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:11,480
weak useful as it shows, I am already

677
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,190
directly here generating the in the bar

678
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,260
this

679
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,750
html in the address that I have put to be

680
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:20,390
able to enter d  Directly on my ip and be

681
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,610
able to see that I can access

682
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:26,030
the system and it gives me an error that states

683
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,679
that I did all the tests like other

684
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,240
days doing the tests but hey the

685
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,320
effect of emotion

686
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:36,310
always occurs because nothing here I go to

687
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:38,380
windows 7 windows 7 because  Because

688
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,450
windows days I was hitting him a lot

689
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:43,430
with him and in the end he told me nothing

690
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:46,280
I am not going to let you do things that

691
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,620
all things with me but I leave myself that

692
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:51,830
simple well I can also

693
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,930
have read repeat enabled and I

694
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:57,220
have this enabled there and how

695
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:01,260
He told me no no no no in

696
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,809
the end in the end what for windows

697
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:06,690
7 to deactivate it of active roles,

698
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:09,360
let windows defender and well here

699
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,430
we have the goal is play for what you do

700
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:14,059
not know them, he presented them, he has

701
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:18,090
2,147 point which is quite a lot  Like to

702
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:21,090
attack a company or risk anything

703
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:24,120
here, what we choose places it, it

704
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,710
will only happen to us

705
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:28,050
that the company that has apache

706
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,610
wordpress open since it will tell us if

707
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:32,280
there was an e  xploit for that company

708
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,450
here what I am doing caused it

709
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,280
is for today that it is by leaving the multi

710
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,679
people it means that today it allows

711
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,690
multiple connections of different types

712
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:42,420
and the hair the hair is that it generates

713
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,760
a meter for windows that I know

714
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,770
previously that it is  A keylogger

715
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,900
in reverse, that is, the machine

716
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,910
attacks the victim machine connects to

717
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:53,540
me since I am going to let him

718
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:56,190
listen here I am going to configure him with

719
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,020
a

720
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:00,220
local set

721
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:04,630
me ps for the delivery because I want him to

722
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:08,140
listen to a small room and here  He is

723
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,840
running if this person who must

724
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,740
execute

725
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,810
the putter automatically today I

726
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:20,860
unloaded the putt and that was not

727
00:29:21,549 --> 00:29:25,350
waiting for actions to chivas

728
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,130
automatically I should connect

729
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:35,450
good perfect I did something wrong here in him

730
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:37,990
as today

731
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:51,020
I will take the option yes yes

732
00:29:52,429 --> 00:29:57,549
the air for me  friend had it is fine

733
00:29:57,549 --> 00:29:59,740
he

734
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:03,720
the command is all correct

735
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:10,330
what he does not like

736
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,570
but well nothing I want to show you

737
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:18,570
just how

738
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:22,419
easy it is but here I am

739
00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:25,260
liking it

740
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,890
let's go av  er if it was generated again without

741
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:39,550
any type of error equal

742
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:43,020
to listening

743
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,180
once it is generated it gave me an

744
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,010
error again the platform has not been

745
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:49,170
selected the formula windows platform

746
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:51,620


747
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,850
the red ones

748
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:57,590
because they are things that happen

749
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:02,140
until you have tried source version

750
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:10,559
because  Nothing to see if it

751
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,830
has something in there

752
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,350
17 Aug I

753
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,000
update

754
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,860
location there are five minutes to name

755
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,490
time

756
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:29,529
to see

757
00:31:29,529 --> 00:31:32,899
good no he did not like it let's stay with that

758
00:31:32,899 --> 00:31:35,599
when sending that malicious file one that I

759
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:38,299
say of course this precisely we

760
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:40,009
can not connect remotely to the

761
00:31:40,009 --> 00:31:42,229
machine and  leave it also the links

762
00:31:42,229 --> 00:31:43,429
here below leave the commands

763
00:31:43,429 --> 00:31:45,799
simply six commands that, as we

764
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:47,899
can see, this hand is something on my machine due to

765
00:31:47,899 --> 00:31:52,479
the effect of what wants to fail uy

766
00:31:52,479 --> 00:31:55,909
and then comes the installation part

767
00:31:55,909 --> 00:31:57,349
that exactly what I wanted to show as

768
00:31:57,349 --> 00:32:00,369
soon as it is executed is  that country what it will

769
00:32:00,369 --> 00:32:02,330
interpret in that kilo and that is that it is going

770
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:04,879
to get inside the machine and we

771
00:32:04,879 --> 00:32:07,609
will be able to, we will be able to carry out

772
00:32:07,609 --> 00:32:09,830
actions remotely a more  Quina question

773
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:12,349
of having that as great control of

774
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:15,379
this communication or that persistence

775
00:32:15,379 --> 00:32:17,420


776
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,430
within that objective

777
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:21,560
in what way can we avoid this

778
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,200
today again ldr

779
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,000
constant monitoring of some kind of crazy some

780
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,420
kind of something that sounds blind to us then

781
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,880
Sometimes it will not take us

782
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,870
absolutely everything, but well let's

783
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:35,090
see what we remember that we need to

784
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:36,830
know the tactics to be able to

785
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:40,250
defend ourselves in this type of thing and

786
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,350
finally well the action I have three minutes left I

787
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:44,360
wanted to do one

788
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,600
again less is going to  fail

789
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,330
surely but hey the printer

790
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,460
is despite the fact that people who simply

791
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,559
to elevate privileges is to simply

792
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,280
copy a file when mixing it to the powers he

793
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,860
to see the game

794
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:05,870
in three minutes if I do it,

795
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,410
simply copy this file that this

796
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:13,890
guy has put it here later in  Another

797
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:16,460
site would be that explains what the

798
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:19,040
law is about,

799
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,640
we want to follow

800
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,980
the exploit as such, but hey,

801
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,840
let's stay with you simple  Mind you,

802
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:30,470
I'm going to copy it, I paste it on

803
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:33,260
the desktop where I want to

804
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:36,770
paste the downloads, for example, I

805
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:39,710
ran it and I can elevate privileges to the

806
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,870
machine,

807
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:44,440
I'm going here, I think nothing

808
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,450
is going slower,

809
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,250
see that the tests decide

810
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,130
that they were being carried out.

811
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:58,240
work

812
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,660
here we add any point

813
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:10,250
for 11

814
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:21,679
and we paste here

815
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:27,668
what we open what we copy

816
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:33,920
oysters

817
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,949
I do not want to wait for it well I have two minutes left,

818
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:42,189


819
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:57,650
do not make me forgive because

820
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:59,480
I want to show the defense part here

821
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,980
what we do  to know it as we

822
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,170
paste a txt we execute it in the

823
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:05,720
herschel and ready to create a

824
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,400
user with privileges it is that

825
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,250
simple we do not have anything here we have

826
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,770
I am going to leave a link where we

827
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:14,510
press it and it will show us a million

828
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:17,030
of  tools to use with many

829
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:19,520
advanced techniques to use them in

830
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,620
terms of reagents and well here we have

831
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,330
a little of what

832
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,880
reptilian defends that would be parts of the d system  and

833
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,310
you are always there

834
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:30,740
or putting a tax in our status

835
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,740
that has defined 174 techniques does not serve

836
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,140
dentists and tactics and all this but

837
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,000
what has left us quite cool is

838
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,490
this matrix

839
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:42,620
so income

840
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:45,020
because because with this matrix what we

841
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,670
can see are the tactics

842
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:50,150
more advanced techniques that have as a platform

843
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,610
or however we want to see it then here

844
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:54,350
we have the matrix hey here I want to

845
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:56,810
see you persistence precisely what I eat

846
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:58,160
what I was doing

847
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,110
I want to see something

848
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:02,420
specific I right click it and tell it to see

849
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,550
technique and here I am going to  show that

850
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:06,560
technique that is used and in the way to

851
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,190
mitigate it

852
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,570
and if I right-click it and the

853
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,520
critical freedom will show us all the

854
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:18,330
tactics how it executes that

855
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:19,830
technique as much then it is

856
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:23,010
quite good to know that

857
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:25,250
this matrix

858
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,050
because because we have there  Everything if we

859
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,870
can choose it by

860
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:32,210
platform we also have another one that is

861
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:34,190
this and I am going to finish and I am going to

862
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,599
cut it,

863
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,549
which is simply based for

864
00:36:37,549 --> 00:36:39,170
defense everything  what would be garden and

865
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:41,380
detection

866
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:44,239
and isolation and good in the same

867
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:47,180
way if we click it if we

868
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,569
right click we can see directly

869
00:36:49,569 --> 00:36:52,430
what each technique is, as it is defined,

870
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:53,989
this helps us a lot to

871
00:36:53,989 --> 00:36:56,480
define it in terms of 100

872
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,720
and well  a little more let's stay with that

873
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,970
these two tools are going to help us a

874
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,890
lot in terms of the typical

875
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,930
defenses and well, finally, nothing was what I

876
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:09,890
wanted to leave for you, it is not a

877
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:12,230
voice or a single cybersecurity state

878
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,730
but it is that transfer of

879
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:15,950
knowledge  From all this that we have

880
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,930
on the left side a

881
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:20,270
fluid communication facilitating improvements in attention

882
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:23,750
and defense in avant-garde techniques

883
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,760
as you did attack-defense the guard like

884
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,350
these two matrices that are quite

885
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:30,530
alone for the entire defense part of

886
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:33,950
the organization and well nothing

887
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:37,149
Thank you very much I think that I ran

888
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,349
during the 35 minutes, sorry for the

889
00:37:40,349 --> 00:37:41,670
accident but hey I wanted to show that

890
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,140
of all the things that seem

891
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,869
quite enough to me  and interesting so that they have

892
00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:49,020
that spark of curiosity here and want to

893
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,170
continue learning,

894
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:53,089
well, Antonio I tell you that this

895
00:37:53,089 --> 00:37:55,190
spark is curiosity, it is setting fire to

896
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,710
the networks right now everyone is

897
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,770
asking us for the links

898
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:02,480
that I can leave them so I already committed myself to

899
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,400
it.  that you are going

900
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,270
to enter the community again and be able to

901
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:10,490
share with them from the last

902
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:13,849
table that people have shown they do not want to

903
00:38:13,849 --> 00:38:16,760
know they do not want to have and others also

904
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,339
that they have been showing

905
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:21,829
throughout their presentation do not

906
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:24,470
worry about the subject  On the subject

907
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:27,290
of things that sometimes do not go live and

908
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:29,270
are totally live, the test they

909
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:30,920
are doing is also totally

910
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,770
up, so this type of thing usually

911
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,809
happens, this type of thing happens so

912
00:38:35,809 --> 00:38:38,030
all calm, do not worry about that

913
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:41,660
If it is not good, there are a couple of questions

914
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,910
that I have to share with this dear

915
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:46,609
Antonio and one of them is

916
00:38:46,609 --> 00:38:47,930
related

917
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:50,330
to the position that you have. He has not seen

918
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:51,640
the topic of

919
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:56,030
The cloud is something that in a couple of years

920
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:59,020
will practically be my grade

921
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:05,770
and the last question was in the

922
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,310
profile of

923
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:16,190
curiosity simply curiosity I

924
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,980
would say that beyond all curiosity

925
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,900
because what takes us to where we are

926
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,630
is to say hey I'm going  to migrate this and

927
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,610
you are always curious what could happen if

928
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:27,980
I do this what could happen if I leave something

929
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:31,660
free if I go to for example I will

930
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,070
save you some through a forest

931
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:36,080
decided to connect to camps if this is

932
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,640
confidential what happens if I leave it public

933
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,280
what happens if they do not leave https always

934
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,070
that interests me that curiosity

935
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:45,650
ahead and well nothing like always

936
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:47,840
know the attack know you

937
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,820
always be in the forefront of reading and saying

938
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,490
hey look these are the last attacks

939
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:54,530
the impression is the nightmare of

940
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:56,810
windows last attack how  I can stop it

941
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:59,840
with a defense because afterwards

942
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,570
where not the only way as who says

943
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:05,750
that the profile is when it comes to that they are

944
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:06,860
going to hire you because we

945
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,690
hire us with  mo architects in security

946
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:11,870
for defense of the perimeter and to know the

947
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:14,540
components you want to be a

948
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,340
key security architect the main thing is to

949
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,250
know all the type of

950
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:21,020
mechanism of those resources that have

951
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,970
so much to the south so much w can be heard so that

952
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,260
the wafd can serve me  The

953
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,590
hardware is good for what use is a TV that

954
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,840
1.1 no longer serves me 1.3 it has to be and

955
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,330
see in what way I can break it and in

956
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:33,950
what way I can guarantee it that

957
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:35,540
it can

958
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:39,190
not, it does not break so easy

959
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:41,050
perfect and right now  that we have

960
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:42,750
worked a lot of tools

961
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:46,859
and everything else of

962
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:48,780
artificial intelligence

963
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,609
threatens how to automate a series

964
00:40:51,609 --> 00:40:56,260
of work professions you think you think

965
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:59,440
that in the case of the profession of a

966
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,079
cybersecurity architect this

967
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:05,829
may be a threat precisely

968
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:08,650
this or it goes  Well, you think that it will be the

969
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:11,200
option of the human for the machine, what

970
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,140
this 5 is going to do to us is the

971
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:17,369
most powerful in the

972
00:41:17,369 --> 00:41:20,770
medium or long term. I would like to say

973
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,270
that it would be a  fusion gave a command and

974
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:23,680
machine this but from what we are

975
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,650
seeing previously in the shows the

976
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,790
touches the cybersecurity person center

977
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:30,069
existed or n1 and n2 that

978
00:41:30,069 --> 00:41:31,780
the intelligent people came said we are going to

979
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,480
put artificial intelligence to 100 which

980
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,829
at the same time we are going to  apply this is a

981
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:37,810
solar that will be because they

982
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:39,160
are saying that level 1 is

983
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,239
charged to me by

984
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:41,949
that intelligence that I put into a

985
00:41:41,949 --> 00:41:43,749
person to identify if it is

986
00:41:43,749 --> 00:41:46,419
a false positive or not of the

987
00:41:46,419 --> 00:41:49,079
intelligence that is going to hasten

988
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:51,489
this  He guarantees us bad times in

989
00:41:51,489 --> 00:41:53,409
terms of the answer and all this but

990
00:41:53,409 --> 00:41:56,109
the match and he encouraged him one day this is going to

991
00:41:56,109 --> 00:41:58,949
leave us in our house

992
00:41:59,069 --> 00:42:01,929
I tell you with thick knowledge

993
00:42:01,929 --> 00:42:04,769
because once we

994
00:42:04,769 --> 00:42:07,959
say it we are going to decrease we are going to move on

995
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:11,469
to the boys  of neuro holes so that

996
00:42:11,469 --> 00:42:12,939
they take care of the more advanced things

997
00:42:12,939 --> 00:42:14,379
but to what extent until the point

998
00:42:14,379 --> 00:42:15,879
of machi learning has this learning

999
00:42:15,879 --> 00:42:18,549
league I already know this advanced that I did

1000
00:42:18,549 --> 00:42:20,379
was to rotate the person  I know I

1001
00:42:20,379 --> 00:42:22,239
'm going now I'm going to do this

1002
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:23,589
and it's going to be there or we already have here the

1003
00:42:23,589 --> 00:42:25,599
tool such as the security center that

1004
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,599
asu's security center is quite

1005
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:30,339
powerful because because it tells you that it is

1006
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,529
wrong in all and in all these

1007
00:42:32,529 --> 00:42:34,479
subscription and additionally it tells me if

1008
00:42:34,479 --> 00:42:37,059
Do you want to fix it, click here, so

1009
00:42:37,059 --> 00:42:38,439
you don't have to do anything and it tells you and

1010
00:42:38,439 --> 00:42:40,059
I'm going to fix them by following these steps,

1011
00:42:40,059 --> 00:42:42,159
being that safety brakes and

1012
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:44,499
saw to scrub pc security and the

1013
00:42:44,499 --> 00:42:45,999
safety brake that you tell me but

1014
00:42:45,999 --> 00:42:48,760
I will get here

1015
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,710
but well, yes,

1016
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:54,920
well that only tells us one thing

1017
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,440
that we must learn machine language

1018
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,589


1019
00:42:59,589 --> 00:43:02,530
because if or if we have to speak or

1020
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:04,970
have the next architects of

1021
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:08,649
artificial intelligence creation

1022
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:19,930
and

1023
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,440
the public

1024
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,260
of course is not all that would be an

1025
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:35,180
incentive and more  that everything so that for

1026
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:36,680
me to be able to identify that communication

1027
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,140
between that exists once I am

1028
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:40,750
within the company or for example

1029
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:43,550
studying the company or I managed to sneak the

1030
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:45,560
wifi  of guests or already enabled it and I see

1031
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,500
everything that happens

1032
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,880
I create those pages as well as the ones that we

1033
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,770
cloned previously with http so

1034
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:52,030
that people believe that they are in the

1035
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:55,750
correct one and see the traffic try

1036
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:58,210
where you want to go where that where they

1037
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:00,750
tried to go

1038
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:04,559
everything  Rafael huamán asks

1039
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:06,359
and what is a point of view when

1040
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:08,400
an advanced attack took place that

1041
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,279
was not stuck peter like football

1042
00:44:11,279 --> 00:44:13,680
how football can act in front of that

1043
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,119
scenario

1044
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,950
when I entered the function of that

1045
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:18,569
knowledge because because

1046
00:44:18,569 --> 00:44:20,999
unknown attacks is when he says  The part of

1047
00:44:20,999 --> 00:44:22,980
the first thing they do is detected is

1048
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:25,140
the blood team and the loot is the first

1049
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,759
to see the eye at work they

1050
00:44:26,759 --> 00:44:28,589
entered and I have no idea who

1051
00:44:28,589 --> 00:44:31,079
my income rating tell me how you could

1052
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:33,329
have entered this in this machine

1053
00:44:33,329 --> 00:44:35,999
is  when the 25 points are going to have that

1054
00:44:35,999 --> 00:44:37,920
boy's work bar to

1055
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,119
work together as who says

1056
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,400
to see how someone

1057
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,400
entered and went to work the bookstore v  Let's

1058
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,079
see it, type of process that was

1059
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,210
what makes this windows necessary,

1060
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:50,279
which is quite fashionable, this is the last thing,

1061
00:44:50,279 --> 00:44:51,839
I simply was a library

1062
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:56,430
that is allowed and when creating css

1063
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:59,249
drivers they managed to identify, hey, look if

1064
00:44:59,249 --> 00:45:01,289
this driver was installed, it's fine  This is it,

1065
00:45:01,289 --> 00:45:03,390
we are going to modify a library

1066
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:05,190
and we put a remote execution on it and

1067
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:06,960
we are inside the machine and

1068
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,240
privilege it but all that comes with the

1069
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,430
result that you hear from that

1070
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:13,160
knowledge as to

1071
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:16,079
how the post morten governs it

1072
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,910
as how  I would say the part of florence

1073
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:22,170
dear antonio I think that all the

1074
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:24,029
questions are for today the other thing that

1075
00:45:24,029 --> 00:45:26,849
you stay inviting you to join our

1076
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:29,819
chat health that is still presented to us

1077
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:32,940
and we are going to pass the books so there

1078
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,579
is a lot of commotion in that sense  And the

1079
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:38,460
last thing he asks us I repeat is if your

1080
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:41,369
mask on the back is not a

1081
00:45:41,369 --> 00:45:43,579
martini but

1082
00:45:43,579 --> 00:45:47,329
this only recognizes

1083
00:45:48,469 --> 00:45:51,930
how beautiful it is, dear owners, the truth is

1084
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:54,479
