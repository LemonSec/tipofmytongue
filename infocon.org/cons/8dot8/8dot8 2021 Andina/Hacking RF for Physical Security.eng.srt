00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:09,570
community good afternoon man at 28.8

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,059
I see that everything is still very attentive to

4
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:14,190
social networks there I see a lot of

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,379
interaction also in our chat on

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,500
the platform and

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,910
point more of a friend is in our

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,449
penultimate talk of the day this time the

9
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:26,430
turn of Argentina  and we will be with

10
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,849
francisco poster francisco character and he

11
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:31,679
will not be talking about his

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,050
garden issues and rf for physics when feeling

13
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,329
milestone let me tell you about

14
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:40,410
francisco love to be an engineer

15
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,440
happ metrix is francisco is an

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,300
independent security and informatics researcher

17
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,450
has  taught workshop courses and

18
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,190
security talks from different conference institutions, he

19
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,500
has also attended and

20
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,690
actively participates in conferences

21
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,980
such as tesco

22
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,060
ekoparty de tierra among others and

23
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,459
is currently the organizer of 404 are

24
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:07,010
a system community whose objective

25
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,540
is to connect people with the

26
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,370
same interests  so they can

27
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,340
share their knowledge and francisco

28
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,260
where we welcome that  We would

29
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:19,190
like to thank you for contributing with Andean 8.8

30
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,070
that you can comment from our

31
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:26,120
main interest in this

32
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,280
non-profit community that is definitely those

33
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,650
of the south of knowledge and the subject of

34
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,540
democratizing knowledge so I

35
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,970
am sure that with a spoon to

36
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,010
contribute a little with what  we

37
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,600
pretend precisely that it is

38
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,910
knowledge knowledge and more

39
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:45,110
knowledge may be of francisco

40
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,600
the public is all yours

41
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,030
francisco if you can remove please

42
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,800
henri good afternoon thank you very much the

43
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,240
truth that nothing i am very happy to be

44
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,610
here in 8.8 andean trying always

45
00:01:58,610 --> 00:01:59,780
like that voice sharing  the

46
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,800
knowledge for all

47
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,900
dear francisco this one follows us

48
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,060
around more than 1000 people and

49
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,979
we have practically managed to beat the

50
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,290
record of last year this is our

51
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:14,920
second version 38 points of the mine

52
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,050
so i am sure that little by little

53
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,910
we are managing to improve the previous

54
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,890
version  to which I welcome

55
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,230
the one who devoured a select public  That they are

56
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,300
looking at us from more than 18 countries at this

57
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,380


58
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,030
perfect moment

59
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,210
give me a second there I will start to

60
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,750
share

61
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,090
well

62
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,569
now there

63
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,280
I already know about your presentation screen

64
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,130
well well

65
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,060
welcome to this talk of hakim

66
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,330
around for physics and curití

67
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,060
as henry recently commented my name  it is

68
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,860
francisco candel and I am currently

69
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,170
apse kim jong-il in hi metrix I have

70
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,430
some cybersecurity certifications such

71
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,550
as the ch or the jpt and

72
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,660
now being junk of the

73
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,250
certifications as they can be heroes

74
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,019
esp I like my free time

75
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:15,390
participating in the ctf is to be around

76
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,150
Example with a hacker box and as I

77
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,470
also mentioned at the beginning the

78
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,560
organizer of a community called 404

79
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,980
are

80
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,690
well let's see a little about what we are going

81
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,250
to talk about in today's talk,

82
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,269
first we are going to give a brief

83
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:30,909
introduction ok this talk the idea  of

84
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:32,319
this talk itself will be a little bit the

85
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,519
different technologies that are used

86
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,530
for radio frequency inks that are

87
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,640
used in access control systems

88
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,640
is  see them a little above and

89
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,440
see what type of common attacks or what

90
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,910
type of access is there and then

91
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,799
taking a monkey contains a conclusion

92
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,780
a final conclusion then we would have

93
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,150
a good introduction at the beginning

94
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,019
then we are going to give these these

95
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:52,209
frequencies used we are going to the

96
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:54,549
technologies  nfc and rafael and we are going to

97
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:56,860
talk about devices in 433 more at

98
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,900
hertz we are going to give good what types of

99
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,480
attacks can be carried out and we are going to

100
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,849
close with some final conclusions

101
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:06,069
well to start an

102
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:07,599
access control system basically its

103
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,510
electronic system that allows or restricts  the

104
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,030
access to a user a specific area

105
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,200
validating the identification through

106
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,579
different types of readings such as entering

107
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:17,918
a key by keyboard a tag or

108
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,779
biometric method and at the same time controlling a

109
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,339
compound resource, for example opening the

110
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:23,440
door and by means of an

111
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,750
electrical device such as  an electromagnet

112
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,990
or a motor allows access

113
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,850
within the radio frequencies in

114
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,260
the control system of  e accesses we can

115
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,430
find the following we are going to

116
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:37,630
find efe of nfc systems in 433

117
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,080
megahertz and then we have watch efe rf and

118
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,940
today we are now going to give more in

119
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,850
detail for example this watch efe rifai

120
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,140
falls within the category I referred but

121
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,300
I put it separated by a  A separate question

122
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,510
for the girl, now well note that

123
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,580
each of these systems

124
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,550
uses this radio frequency network in one in

125
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,080
different systems as it can be, for

126
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,250
example, in the first image we can see

127
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,190
that for the referral access control

128
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:06,610
we see a simple numerical pan and with

129
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,040
Well, a referral reader that would be a

130
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,870
frequency reader, now we are going to

131
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,310
open it, which is a simple access control

132
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,600
such as a gym, for example,

133
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,430
then we have a system or we

134
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,130
need more complexity in it,

135
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,020
we have readers, for example, nfc there for

136
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,160
example  What we are seeing is the door

137
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,080
of a hotel now we have a

138
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,000
hotel they give us a card to

139
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,740
access rooms it would be a  nfc system

140
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,480


141
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,710
later we have on the other hand if there are

142
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,470
devices that work in 433 36 my

143
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,630
heart 'here we go there we go

144
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:39,020
to the point to the point of the devices in

145
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,570
436 my heart we put a lot of

146
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,770
devices between them well how

147
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,270
you will see a gate when we

148
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,890
enter the important  Drive from

149
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,990
America, we need to activate, for example,

150
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,950
alarms, vehicle alarms, weather stations,

151
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,600
we have a lot of

152
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,190
devices that work on this

153
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,410
frequency and, well, these watch efe

154
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,980
rf that are used, for example, if it is one

155
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,990
of the categories of the referee,

156
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,600
for example, tele tolls are used.  or hotels, have a

157
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,960
good time, let's

158
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,510
start with the referee ok that is r

159
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,510
freddy no good is to refer basically it

160
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,740
is a wired identification system

161
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,530
which consists of labels

162
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,810
that store information and voters

163
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,520
who can read these labels at

164
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,250
distances ok what components have a

165
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,200
good referral system  has the

166
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,090
labels or tags referred to these are

167
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,800
the best known are as  As you can

168
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,260
see the classics such that we have all

169
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,180
seen at some point and there are two types of

170
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,090
stacks: active and passive ok the

171
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,250
active ones are those that have a

172
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,070
battery that already have a source

173
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,380
ok and the passive ones are those that do not have

174
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,820
a power source  Inside in this

175
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,440
case for example these we all

176
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,480
know that we never have to change the

177
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,280
battery nothing in this case for example it

178
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,770
would be such a vacuum an example of an

179
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,380
active tag would be for example in

180
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,030
ancient times they were used in the three

181
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,400
tolls they needed to be a small

182
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,260
pyrite that  It would be an example of a is

183
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,540
active then well we have the reader

184
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,000
or the interrogator and finally

185
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,569
forward,

186
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:11,610
how does a refining system

187
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:12,710


188
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,849
work? It basically works in a

189
00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:17,580
simple way with these three simple steps. The

190
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,169
first step is for the reader that

191
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:20,819
we have to believe.  an

192
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:22,139
electromagnetic field that what it does is

193
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:24,209
allow to feed the tav, that is, how

194
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:26,399
does it energize it?

195
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:28,289
to the reader this

196
00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:30,209
reader emits an electromagnetic field

197
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:32,189
now we are going to see it well in a graph

198
00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:35,039
is a little of that energy escapes energy

199
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,229
jumps to ok as you can see in step 2

200
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:39,179
the 'tax energizes and the

201
00:07:39,179 --> 00:07:40,740
information contained within the

202
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,539
memory such and good the reader obviously

203
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:44,369
receives the information contains altabix

204
00:07:44,369 --> 00:07:47,550
it is processed for the action that you want to

205
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,740
perform well here we can see the case

206
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,909
in the graph that we have good the

207
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:53,879
reader here look at how good we have

208
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:56,659
the antenna that emits the magnetic field

209
00:07:56,659 --> 00:08:01,589
ok energize  the world gold answer ok and

210
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:03,649
sen there energizers

211
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,639
once it has energy it can

212
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:08,550
transmit the required data to

213
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,009
the reader

214
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:14,520
well now what frequencies what types of

215
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,169
frequencies are used to refer well

216
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:17,759
we have three types of healthy categories

217
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,099
refer already one we commented that the uach

218
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,039
efe ok ultra high frequency that is around in

219
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,460
the range of 860

220
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:29,069
1928 to handle approximately ok and this

221
00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:30,839
is most commonly used for

222
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:34,049
telepeaj  e is three passes etc then

223
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:37,289
we have the frequency light which is the

224
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:38,760
first we saw the one we saw from the

225
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,380
controls is the same as it could be something

226
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,919
simple buy a gym etc.

227
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,290
which is for example standard in faith the

228
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,360
frequency range of 125 kilos hearts

229
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,300
to  134 kilos and we can find

230
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,130
technologies such as a laxe and

231
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,930
proximity to the flex m400 cx etc.

232
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,160
what this frequency has is that it is

233
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,810
a section will be the

234
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,339
oldest and most insecure technologies since they

235
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:04,130
do not support screaming and cryptography and

236
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:06,079
then we have the  high frequency that

237
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,399
later and now a little while we are going to see

238
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:10,070
is where the nfc is located in the

239
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,829
good one is 13.56 megahertz and

240
00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:14,110
we already have

241
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,250
technologies such as the che declares there are

242
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,260
classes the my fire now we are going to the greatest

243
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,850
classic etcetera

244
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,740
that we can find inside  from a

245
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,860
freddy workshop ok let's look at a

246
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,300
low frequency the most common is that it only

247
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,410
contains help from dirty dikes

248
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,329
only as an identifier as

249
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:33,250
I mentioned is for al  go simpler as it

250
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,019
may be you need to identify

251
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:37,930
something a person is already a

252
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,759
simple system that does not have a

253
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:42,579
greater complexity as you can see there it only

254
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:44,560
has a yo eddie that is written by the

255
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,470
4-byte manufacturer in that case

256
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,389
obviously all this depends  Notice that

257
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,339
in parentheses it is clarified that the so-called does

258
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:53,379
not depend on the tag, it depends on the

259
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:56,470
manufacturer, they owe a lot of things, which

260
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,759
is the structure of the so-called, but hey in

261
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,069
this case the turn one of the two would yield

262
00:10:00,069 --> 00:10:01,389
the two most common than in the or cousins

263
00:10:01,389 --> 00:10:04,689
so it would be  the mm 4,100 in hf would be the

264
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:07,139
greatest classic

265
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,999
good then as we take into account in the

266
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:11,790
frequency we are going to find the solo and in

267
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,189
the high frequency for example a spot

268
00:10:14,189 --> 00:10:15,420
nearby if we are going to find that we have

269
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,949
the aedile and it is we are going to find that

270
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:20,489
we have that they are 1024  bits that is an

271
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:22,619
area that one can write at ease ok

272
00:10:22,619 --> 00:10:24,839
this for example the hf we

273
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:26,730
can see that it is used and now we

274
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,619
will see it well in detail with nfc good

275
00:10:28,619 --> 00:10:29,699
as I mentioned not t  and you are

276
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:32,479
universities etc.

277
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,980
what attacks could be carried out

278
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,889
in a network and low frequency ok deleu

279
00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:39,949
frequency good basically two

280
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:43,560
cloning or emulation ok for

281
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,790
cloning special hostels are needed

282
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,589
if I wanted to rewrite

283
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:49,380
this this could not because it is not a

284
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,360
tag that  Let me write, that's why it is

285
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,800
another very important piece of information that I forgot to

286
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,329
mention that as the manufacturer writes it

287
00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:57,329
theoretically theoretically I

288
00:10:57,329 --> 00:10:59,430
cannot write it simply I could not

289
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,649
write that sector I could not write

290
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:05,279
the wide and ok both good in the low

291
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,110
frequency and the high frequency now

292
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,820
Let's see what it is for a while and as

293
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,410
I told you here in low frequency we have

294
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,760
such specials that if they allow us to

295
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,829
rewrite what the manufacturer wrote

296
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:16,589
and as you can see it can also be

297
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:18,389
emulated we here put them a for

298
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:19,800
example devices that one could

299
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,110
use  to do this for example there is

300
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,510
a famous Chinese renfe program that

301
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,570
now this is cheap but it may fail

302
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,220
m  hereafter we have higher-end devices

303
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,860
such as the case and that this allows you to

304
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,079
clone and emulate, look, that is, one can

305
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,610
use that positive 6 as if it were

306
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,529
a car alarm with a button, you

307
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:40,950
can press and record saving the

308
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,800
content of a stick and with  The other

309
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,690
can write it on a special tag that

310
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,810
are those that are there and then we have

311
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:50,760
the prox brand and well, it is also a

312
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,590
device, it is ideal if you

313
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,000
want to enter the world of

314
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,850
what everything is,

315
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,840
including nfc,

316
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:03,380
well, already passing a little  more to nfc ene

317
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,370
efe this means neither free

318
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,050
communications is basically a

319
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,180
wireless communication technology

320
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,399
that was derived from high

321
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,860
frequency technology be it from hf of referendum and opera

322
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,209
as we already mentioned a frequency of

323
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:16,850
13.56 mahuts ok the curious thing is an

324
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,769
nfc device is  that it is capable of both

325
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:22,899
acting as a reader or as a label.

326
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:25,329


327
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:27,069


328
00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:29,920


329
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,050
let's talk about myfair cards

330
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,509
ok mainfer is basically a

331
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:36,610
brand that is, it is a registered trademark

332
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:39,879
owned by xp semiconductors ok of

333
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:41,259
a series of chips used in

334
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:43,269
contactless smart cards and

335
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:45,189
proximity cards of this type of

336
00:12:45,189 --> 00:12:48,279
cards which are the

337
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:49,809
Mayfair nfs cards we are going to find it in

338
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:51,819
controls access are hotels

339
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:53,889
public transport for example that is me here in

340
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:56,379
Argentina at one time and now they

341
00:12:56,379 --> 00:13:00,339
used us mind fest classic it is never

342
00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:01,929
very controlled very how to find it

343
00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:04,390
in several different places

344
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:07,750
let's see a touch like  that is made up of the

345
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,000
structure of a classic major,

346
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,990
let's look at the flames carefully, well

347
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,070
basically, the memory of a

348
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,350
classic major is divided into 16 sectors,

349
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,910
look here, we can the

350
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,650
sectors, look, we have sector 15,

351
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,350
sector 14, so until we reach sector 0

352
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:26,560
that we have 16  sectors each of

353
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,510
these sectors contains three blocks

354
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,980
notice each of these sectors

355
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,250
contains three blocks ok  In the last

356
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,290
block, that is, in block 3 of each

357
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,570
sector, look at the last block of each

358
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:41,380
sector, ok, it is stored, it has the

359
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,510
access bits and the secret keys, which is

360
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,150
the secret and luck, and now, here, see and

361
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,100
depending on how these are configured

362
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,480
access bits that are

363
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,120
always in the last block,

364
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,770
the reader will have to use

365
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:56,560
the kia hello khyber to authenticate, that is,

366
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,810
here we indicate that here you

367
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,130
will have to authenticate to perform

368
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,340
what action and well get to each of

369
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,270
the sides  Within the last block

370
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,430
we can find them

371
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,980
ok and then another very important thing to

372
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,250
clarify is that within sector 0

373
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,720
when we reach sector 0

374
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,200
in block 0 there is this

375
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,580
information from the manufacturer and this website and

376
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,800
that theoretically cannot be modified,

377
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,000
it is unchangeable

378
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,710
well

379
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,960
What known attacks do we have? Which are

380
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,540
the most common in nfc? Well, the first one

381
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,760
exists for an attack ok that basically

382
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,130
allows you to find if you have

383
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,960
default keys and go  extracting other keys

384
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,090
knowing the value of a single key

385
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,460
one of the tur that can be used by smf or and

386
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,620
then we have the arcade one that this

387
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,940
attack basically takes advantage of the little

388
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,680
entropy that is used in

389
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,320
crypto 1 encryption to obtain by

390
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,110
brute force the key of a  sector a very important thing to

391
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,490
clarify this and as

392
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,980
I mentioned before theoretically it could not be

393
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,810
rewritten and theoretically we could not

394
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:00,300
modify but what happens there are the

395
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,270
famous chinese magic cards that one

396
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,790
can buy quite

397
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:09,150
cheaply and can grab and modify the

398
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,430
book from 10 to card then  with this

399
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:14,040
one can achieve an exact clone an exact clone

400
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,990
of an nfc card

401
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,940
devices that we can use well

402
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,640
I only just the next one this

403
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,950
even if one does not have a budget

404
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,600
to do it with a low budget

405
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,430
can make an arduino even with

406
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,170
readers for example here we have the

407
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:33,649
nfc reader just do 22 u these

408
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:35,990
are very very good readers to

409
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,360
start  to be able to experiment with these

410
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,630
technologies well here what we are going to

411
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,750
do is we are going to give a demo that I

412
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,899
am going to explain in which what we are going to

413
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:50,320
do in using the mf attack ok now

414
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,490
we are going to see

415
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:57,910
if they put the quality up if it is  They saw

416
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:02,530
and we what we are going to do efe

417
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:05,800
doom where there when the keys are obtained

418
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,690
what to do is going to dump in

419
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,510
a file that you can see now and there you

420
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,040
can see well in the command that is

421
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,080
executed note that they are here

422
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,820
for  default ok it is found that all

423
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,490
the corners are ff and well with the

424
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:21,040
here there is only one here at ff and

425
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,610
then it starts to go trying to get

426
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,010
the other keys it is not done it

427
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,230
is taking it takes a while but with

428
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,420
getting a key  As I explained to you in

429
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,910
the attack, in this attack the cold, look at

430
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,590
how it is taking out starting to

431
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:38,430
take out all the keys,

432
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:41,950
well there it is finished there and it has finished

433
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,690
removing all the keys what we are going to

434
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,570
use to do is a tool

435
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:50,770
called them mf from Madrid ok  with the  Which one are we going

436
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:53,860
to grab and we're going to read this one that

437
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,320
we made of all the content and it

438
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,780
includes the ones here and look there there you

439
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,790
can see the different sectors in this

440
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,620
case look well the sector 0 blocks

441
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,030
but look at this theoretically it would be the

442
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:06,220
sector 0 blocks 0  that contains free and

443
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,800
modifiable note that later it contains

444
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,020
data, note here are the

445
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,730
access bits, then we have the

446
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,069
different kits, look good, the quique

447
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:18,640
that are all ff the free one and then

448
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,630
you can also see which blocks were

449
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,130
written.

450
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,720
They leave zero they are left

451
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,810
by corfo in this case it is a hotel card

452
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,790


453
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,040
which I cannot mention names but

454
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,730
that is a case with no longer it is not that it was

455
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,740
a card armed during a

456
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,810
card used in an access control

457
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,480
note

458
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,140
well

459
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,420
let's move on  a little now to devices

460
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,850
in 433 more serious than these for me are

461
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:46,930
the most fun and the most

462
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,660
interesting because because I eat

463
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,460
only a lot of  things work

464
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,410
on this frequency

465
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,470
panic buttons wireless doorbells

466
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,940
wireless alarms or even

467
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,640
wired alarms not many times the alarms

468
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,320
that one will have will be in their house no matter

469
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,790
how hard it is wired they have devices

470
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:06,640
like these so that one can deactivate it

471
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,390
before it arrives

472
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:11,290
and this processes on that frequency

473
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,100
Obviously many of these devices,

474
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,260
for example, the sensors in the

475
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,700
wireless alarms also transmit

476
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,270
this frequency, but even if,

477
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,770
as I just mentioned, the alarm is

478
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,630
wired, many times you have these

479
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:26,180
of these devices, then we have

480
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,160
good weather stations or

481
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,470
even with any one hundred gates.  and

482
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:33,929
even good vehicle alarms

483
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:35,909
well how can we hear this

484
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:38,190
frequency good to start

485
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:38,909
experimenting this frequency we would

486
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,220
need a cdr in this case it

487
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,419
is an rtl cdr is a speech of saleh

488
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:46,619
15 20 hours a fairly

489
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:49,499
inexpensive device to start and we have

490
00:18:49,499 --> 00:18:51,929
tools like the  g  q rx usually happens

491
00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:54,029
to richard because now what we are

492
00:18:54,029 --> 00:18:56,309
going to do that interests us

493
00:18:56,309 --> 00:19:02,340
happens to them the srx sdr is that of rehab

494
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:06,590
and we are going to try to see

495
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:10,389
a frequency of this alarm that we are going

496
00:19:10,389 --> 00:19:14,559
to see the waterfall not now many are going to

497
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,169
now we are going to  go see a little how it

498
00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:19,419
is that we are going to obtain

499
00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:23,980
useful information from this waterfall, not there,

500
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,139
I recommend you, I will give if you lowered

501
00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:28,330
the volume a little because it makes a noise

502
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:30,730
and surely you heard a noise that is of

503
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,250
medium static because it makes the

504
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,980
annoying better  He lowered the volume a little,

505
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,519
look there when he pressed, listen,

506
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:41,340
I am transmitting,

507
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,640
ok now,

508
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,650
with this device we can listen to

509
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:49,590
this, but from here, how do we get

510
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:52,140
to clone or see what this contains?

511
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,260
Well, the point is what

512
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,560
we do is let's record  the audio and

513
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,960
if we record the audio, look,

514
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,240
we are going to

515
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,510
record the audio for about 34 keystrokes,

516
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:15,070
we are going to stop the program and one is a

517
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,870
very common program called audacity

518
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:19,870
ok we are going to analyze the audio the recorded audio

519
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,180


520
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,070
and what we are going to notice, notice how there are

521
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,920
certain patterns here in the audacity that

522
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,090
although it is repeated in, look at the

523
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,170
beats when we say four

524
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,390
beats, look at the four

525
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,370
beats that are repeated, those are

526
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:33,810
evident that they were made  four

527
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:36,600
beats now let's look at each of

528
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,950
these pulses there are some like

529
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,540
different pulses notice there are some smaller

530
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:43,260
ones others bigger ok

531
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,830
now well let's see it in a file

532
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,150
that can be seen a little better

533
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,460
sometimes the recordings come out well

534
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,740
but we can't  distinguish we are going to give

535
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,080
a sentence you can see much

536
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,420
clearer look here how you can

537
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,490
distinguish when there is or is within a

538
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:02,250
pulse that was in this case it says reading here

539
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:06,060
would be a pulse notice how here we have

540
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,180
for example different points that are one

541
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,740
more  long and a shorter one now well

542
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,440
how can we interpret this that and that

543
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,880
is where we return we return to the

544
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,400
presentation

545
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,350
how we can int  To interpret this

546
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:21,080
well, basically we can interpret it

547
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,270
as binary code as a 1 or as a

548
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,820
zero, so well, in this way

549
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,610
we are managing to interpret because

550
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:32,090
we can see that the code is putting

551
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,790
this with the 0 0 1 0 1 and we can get to

552
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,190
see this now well  All this I

553
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,470
imagine is a very tedious job and one of

554
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:42,380
the disadvantages that this sdr has is

555
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,879
that

556
00:21:43,879 --> 00:21:46,249
as it tells you, it is a being who is for

557
00:21:46,249 --> 00:21:47,989
you is very good to begin with, it does not

558
00:21:47,989 --> 00:21:49,729
allow us to transmit that we

559
00:21:49,729 --> 00:21:52,129
can only receive then what we

560
00:21:52,129 --> 00:21:54,789
can get  to do is

561
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:57,229
automate this with an arduino ok

562
00:21:57,229 --> 00:21:59,659
automate the reception and emission

563
00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:03,079
with an arduino ok even if you

564
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:05,359
want you can use a device like

565
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:09,170
this a hacker efe one

566
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:12,200
which is one of the most common but if

567
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,480
before I will do much much more lacked

568
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,550
takes us  I can automate with a low

569
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,380
budget using

570
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,900
Arduino, here we have the Arduino and

571
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:24,169
433 megahertz modules,

572
00:22:24,169 --> 00:22:26,149
how are they connected?

573
00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:28,489
ones are totally simple that

574
00:22:28,489 --> 00:22:30,019
is, it is the positive with positive or

575
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:31,789
negative with negative and one that goes to the

576
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:35,859
port that is used for which data

577
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,509
is quite simple there is

578
00:22:38,509 --> 00:22:40,489
the link to find out do not worry at the

579
00:22:40,489 --> 00:22:43,279
end of the presentation it will be a

580
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:45,619
lot  From links the

581
00:22:45,619 --> 00:22:47,929
slides to a medium post that I have

582
00:22:47,929 --> 00:22:49,879
written with this will be ready so there are no

583
00:22:49,879 --> 00:22:51,379
problems to be all the links have at the

584
00:22:51,379 --> 00:22:53,940
end of the presentation

585
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,740
well

586
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:00,450
let's go now with another demo ok where

587
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:03,420
we use an arduino ok with

588
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:06,240
low budget in a homemade way

589
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,040
to ring a doorbell a wireless doorbell

590
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,580


591
00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:15,460
well now what we are going to see

592
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:19,600
well now what we are going to see is the demo

593
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,070
with a first area

594
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:29,750
yes yes yes the program give me a second

595
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:32,150
although go

596
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,330
ok let's

597
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:37,330
give a second  That got into

598
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:41,440
the computer a bit and well, the demo may fail,

599
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,019
guys, it has, it is a

600
00:23:44,019 --> 00:23:45,580
conference, that a great conference, that I

601
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:49,030
do not fail, I want to feel from mine,

602
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,630
so they

603
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:57,320
ask to talk about what was heard.  oh it looks

604
00:23:59,929 --> 00:24:02,860
perfect to bar

605
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:05,980
we give a milestone

606
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,630
well

607
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,060
well now what we are going to see is the demo

608
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,850
with a first hambrick or how we are going to

609
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:23,700
emulate the signal in 433 hearts of this

610
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,200
hambrick single or the first thing we are going to

611
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,850
do is test it we are going to use  the

612
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:29,310
normal button where we see how it

613
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:32,250
works correctly here is the

614
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,560
arduino with the receiver module and the

615
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,660
transmitter already in this case the

616
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:39,270
reception was used, well the

617
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,760
code emitted by the button was intercepted and what we are going to

618
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,990
do is transmit it to this module that

619
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,150
is  Here you can see the home antenna

620
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,860
and now we see them,

621
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:55,010
notice that now it will be in a loop and it

622
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,630
does not stop ringing

623
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,910
obviously this can be done with other

624
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:02,330
types of devices as well and well that

625
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:03,740
is the idea now if we

626
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,200
disconnect software as already

627
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,960
stop transmitting and obviously stop sounding

628
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,480
good

629
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,830
there we could see it

630
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,900
you

631
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:41,550
[Music]

632
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:44,550
and

633
00:25:47,960 --> 00:26:30,380
[Music]

634
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,030
perfect good we have lost

635
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:35,130
communication with Francisco as you

636
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,929
know dear community this is  It is

637
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:40,350
broadcasting live and here the

638
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:43,080
technical team is trying to solve the

639
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,990
problem with Francisco but

640
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,309
we can try a little while

641
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:48,900
interacting with you too.

642
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,789


643
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:53,070


644
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,320


645
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,120
Part of the

646
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,820
security is logical, no, but the

647
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,980
physical security, honestly, I have visited

648
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,960
industrial plants,

649
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,750
hydroelectric plants and a lot of

650
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,179
infrastructure that is called critical

651
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:12,240
and if something has been noticed is that the entire

652
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,159
system of access controls on

653
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,679
twitter on the cards that was

654
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:19,409
showing for example francisco

655
00:27:19,409 --> 00:27:21,360
most of the times 20 inclusive

656
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,130


657
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:26,940
airport access controls are cards are

658
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,880
mainfer cards are cards that are first or

659
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,670
second generation that the truth is that they are

660
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:35,370
too single easy to explore and

661
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:38,700
there are even some

662
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,520
programs in which to download the  cell phone

663
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,010
like now for example what I

664
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:48,600
asked you  It allows you to read precisely the csn that the

665
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,660
poster would be the mind and when you

666
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,180
buy a blank card you can

667
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,370
transfer the serial number of that

668
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:59,070
card to the cloned card and you did it,

669
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:01,410
you want to give all the privileges

670
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:05,010
and the card that you are going to get to the explorer

671
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:07,410
to have all the accesses here I have

672
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:08,880
in my hand if you can see I am going

673
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,340
to bring it a little closer this is one is the

674
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,650
X-ray of a fourth generation card

675
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,270


676
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:17,490
and as you can see you bring

677
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:21,990
efficient to extract the internal antenna

678
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:25,920
for high and low frequency  He already brings a

679
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,500
magnetic stripe reader and he brings a chip

680
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,300
that's what we normally get

681
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,240
on a credit card but

682
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,550
notice what is different about these

683
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:38,670
cards, there are classes of the generation, the

684
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:40,530
different ones are these other two chips that

685
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:42,870
bring one of these  chips that you

686
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:45,210
see are used to encrypt absolutely

687
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:48,480
all the information on the card and this

688
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,790
other chip is a hotel a one time

689
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:53,010
password precisely what we do

690
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,740
You can be changing the

691
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,470
serial number of the card so that it is

692
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,600
already inviolable because to express

693
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,510
the information it is encrypted and to

694
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:06,210
continue we have a glove the password

695
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:08,429
that can be random and ccoo every 15

696
00:29:08,429 --> 00:29:11,580
seconds that is to configure that the good thing

697
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,040
from this  type of fourth

698
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,280
generation card that as you saw this

699
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,670
brings software giving therefore it can

700
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:22,320
be it can calmly

701
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,820
virtualize it and carry it

702
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,880
I had they could open cards

703
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,490
safely interacting with

704
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:33,149
a slightly more robust access control

705
00:29:33,149 --> 00:29:35,370
so

706
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:37,350
another thing that is important  and

707
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:41,250
Francisco also showed the issue

708
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:45,770
of the cards, the accountants already exist,

709
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:48,110
although I do not add you,

710
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:51,720
there are some devices that are

711
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,140
sold to hack cards, tell them, they

712
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,930
already work exactly the same

713
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,730
way as it was, they will have mentioned the

714
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:02,670
issue of frequency by  example there is

715
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:06,650
the chameleon and that a device that is

716
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:09,540
worth a little more than 3  00 dollars

717
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:13,500
and what it allows is to put it in a

718
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,020
backpack you can get on a

719
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,330
motorcycle 2 and what it is going to do that the equipment

720
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:20,460
once turned on will start looking for

721
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,559
the frequency of all the

722
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,130
contactless cards that is light and once  the

723
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:28,200
village the next step to start to lower

724
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,450
precisely all the field that is going to

725
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:32,010
catch in that from there and then

726
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:34,740
transport it a card to a

727
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:40,350
program so that the truth is very complicated

728
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,600
when we talk about access controls,

729
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,990
no because as I was saying,

730
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:50,940
I do not know

731
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,649
from the test go and you will see by types

732
00:30:55,649 --> 00:30:58,529
of cards that you are using

733
00:30:58,529 --> 00:31:01,889
yourselves analyze in your work the type of

734
00:31:01,889 --> 00:31:05,220
card and that said the first second

735
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,529
generation and as we have to work five

736
00:31:07,529 --> 00:31:09,749
are very easy to hack the seattle and not

737
00:31:09,749 --> 00:31:12,360
and what else can we talk about  of

738
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,720
what is the contactless issue

739
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,960
that is the csn is the serial number as

740
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,549
I told you that it brings all the cards

741
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:23,399
up to the fourth generation the issue is to

742
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:28,200
have a 1 tp not to avoid being

743
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,619
cloned n  Normally this card has

744
00:31:31,619 --> 00:31:35,159
a must be managed by

745
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:38,369
open standards such as on the floor 14 43 in

746
00:31:38,369 --> 00:31:42,509
berisso 15 693 since what it does

747
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:44,279
precisely in providing us with information

748
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:46,200
about eta for which it is information

749
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,530
available that can be more used

750
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:52,260
what else  I can tell guys about this from

751
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,690
here while it arrives while we see from

752
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:57,600
restoring with francisco about what

753
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,120
they are all that is the part

754
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,989
of access controls

755
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,110
perfect perfect key confirms to me

756
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,940
that again we have him live to

757
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:12,800
francisco francisco poster

758
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,060
when or when  be

759
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:18,169
available let me know

760
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,930
perfect now yes gentlemen I will

761
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:23,230
leave you with him again I hope everything in this matter

762
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,620
forward dear francisco

763
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,900
if no good

764
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,059
I have the other machine that I am still

765
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:33,630
starting up so in the dark it may fail it

766
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,960
may fail

767
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,430
what they say that it was going to  demo that

768
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:41,510
does not fail is a lie

769
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:44,940
I tell you so it may fail I do not know if he got to

770
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,340
see it we must go to it we will have to see it

771
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,939
again just in case geni

772
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,250


773
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:56,610
I'm not sharing give us a

774
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:59,030


775
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:05,100
perfect second

776
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:21,529
[Music]

777
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,920
time

778
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,000
we will give

779
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:33,900
if now we can see in the video

780
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:45,220
although I am not basically explaining what

781
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,750
we are going to do now with this bell and

782
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,919
the brico that we can see

783
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,830
we can see there

784
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:52,299
with this that  We can here we

785
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:54,250
have the two buttons and what we are

786
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,730
going to do is using an arduino and

787
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:00,640
the 433 megahertz modules,

788
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,640
we are going to emulate that we are one of the

789
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,930
jones buttons that starts

790
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:07,820
transmitting in a loop,

791
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,270
basically, look at

792
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:13,050


793
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:25,290
how the button is used there  and

794
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:27,629
the light comes on

795
00:34:27,629 --> 00:34:29,849
well there, look at the transmitter, it has the

796
00:34:29,849 --> 00:34:33,389
antenna, it was almost there, this is the

797
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:35,929
yellow cable

798
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,168
and

799
00:34:39,168 --> 00:34:40,699
look now, what we are going to do is

800
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:44,839
connect the power bank ok and as soon as

801
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:46,668
the light turns on and it does not begin to

802
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:49,909
transmit the  code that has the

803
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:52,750
transmitter

804
00:34:57,869 --> 00:34:59,180
well

805
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,099
then this is how it would be it would be as good

806
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:03,749
in this case I did it with a

807
00:35:03,749 --> 00:35:06,480
wired doorbell it can also be done as it

808
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,220
can be for example with alarms  with

809
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:13,829
gates to open gates etc. in

810
00:35:13,829 --> 00:35:15,059
fact one of the things that I want to

811
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:16,559
comment on in

812
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:19,980
the world is the famous rolling coach

813
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:24,269
that happens when one grabs more

814
00:35:24,269 --> 00:35:26,069
current cars on examples today there is the

815
00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:28,170
same demo with a car in model 95 and it did not

816
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:30,720
have a rannikko but if one  He used a

817
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,700
vehicle, I use such a device that is already

818
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,920
a little more protected, not how

819
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,599
a device is protected against this type of attack, it

820
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:38,130
is the replay attacks that we

821
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,289
capture the code, we repeat it because

822
00:35:40,289 --> 00:35:42,809
well there the rolling outs were created, ok,

823
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:44,390
basically

824
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:47,220
what we do is  a

825
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,619
random number generator is used they are

826
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:51,900
placed both in the receiver and in the

827
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,460
transmission in the transmitter with the same

828
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,460
seed the transmitter sends the next

829
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,829
code in the sequence the receiver

830
00:35:58,829 --> 00:36:00,599
compares the received code with the

831
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:03,210
expected code and if they are the same it is

832
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:05,250
execute the action in this case I am going

833
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,500
to open a car now well how

834
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,020
could we attack a device with

835
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,580
rolling code than if we  We had

836
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:14,010
a car for example that has this

837
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:16,230
protection not how we could attack the

838
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:18,270
good thing basically we would have

839
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,010
the victim who presses the button that

840
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:22,590
issues the first email ok the attacker what

841
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,200
I can do is use a call

842
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,330
to interfere and prevent the receiver from

843
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:30,720
receiving  said first code ok and in turn

844
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,330
intercepts the code issued and I save it

845
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,490
ok that is to say the one who receives the code is

846
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:38,730
the attacker and the car never gets to

847
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,040
hear it after the

848
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,530
good device has not been activated the victim

849
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:45,000
that it is good to try to press  the

850
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,980
button issuing a second code to

851
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,320
be done attacker intercepts that

852
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,780
second code and sends the first so

853
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,610
that the action device, that is,

854
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,380
so that in this case the car

855
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,810
opens and finally, well, the attacker

856
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:00,120
keeps this second code

857
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,650
available which you will be able to use to

858
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:03,360
activate the device when you

859
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,710
want it in this case it would be with this

860
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,510
second code you could grab acciona

861
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:10,270
Send it and open it to a hundred

862
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:12,100
well and she as if to finish

863
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,800
I want to show this that it is a

864
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,410
very very interesting project, it

865
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:20,110
is in topic 8 and for hackers that it

866
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:22,570
is basic in a device that allows

867
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:25,740
reading network cards  and they are going to create

868
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,330
functionality nfc allows us to work

869
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:31,330
with devices of your trip arts of

870
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:34,000
this that tells you 420 megahertz that

871
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,350
has

872
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:38,160
reception for

873
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,820
infrared transmission for example to be able to

874
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:42,280
change television channels or to be

875
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,090
able to activate an air conditioning

876
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:45,640
activates 203 devices  Let them work by

877
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,310
infrared, the truth is that I thought it was

878
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:50,680
a very, very cool project, I wanted to

879
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,290
share it for now, this is great and it

880
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:54,580
is also a way in which one

881
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,440
could

882
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,010
automate a device that

883
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:58,600
automates quite a lot these various

884
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,890
devices that you demonstrate, such as,

885
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:01,990
for example, it can be him  the case and for

886
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:04,510
example we could have it here

887
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,910
so what the manufacturers are putting

888
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,320
it will put

889
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,060
functionali  dades with nfc so that one

890
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:12,610
can also do tests of lfc badoo

891
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:14,860
functions yesui that acts as

892
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,540
one the truth that for example now is

893
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,820
very very interesting so that you want to

894
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,260
follow the project I recommend it

895
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,960
totally well some references

896
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,370
are all I leave them also for

897
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:26,080
do it later if you want to

898
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,200
go deeper into this topic

899
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,030
here you can find a lot of

900
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,130
information

901
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:34,960
and well finally I wanted to thank

902
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,000
all of you for swallowing they wanted to

903
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
make it evident to the Andean 8.8 to be

904
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,980
good to my colleagues also from de gea

905
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:44,650
of 404 greetings and for a friend of

906
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:46,930
mine who is sure I'm

907
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:49,270
holding on and well I want to leave you

908
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:52,690
there last of the medium that there you will

909
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:54,430
find a post with all this

910
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:58,359
information about this

911
00:38:58,359 --> 00:38:59,920
presentation to tell a post or

912
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,140
exclusively hacking in the boss and you

913
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,340
will find the likes well there I

914
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,560
also left the memory so

915
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,210
good that and many thanks to  all

916
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:09,190
calculations already we go to the question phase

917
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:11,230


918
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:14,440
also armed francisco from here I am going

919
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,800
to you some auto with questions that you

920
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,780
can use the frequency in

921
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:22,590
the network traffic without analyzing the data

922
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:26,050
and based on a quantity a

923
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:27,730
database with different signals

924
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:30,040
data transfer to analyze

925
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,550
the same

926
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,220
carmen could repeat the question if it

927
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,319
seems that it shares the two parts the

928
00:39:37,319 --> 00:39:39,420
first one can analyze the frequency

929
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:43,349
and network traffic without analyzing the

930
00:39:43,349 --> 00:39:45,529


931
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,500
data can analyze the frequency depends

932
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,690
on any frequency I imagine that it

933
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:52,790
is not  saying a specific frequency so

934
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:56,480
you can analyze the frequencies if the

935
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,220
question what you are doing is and one

936
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,320
can determine how that frequency is modulated

937
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,750
without analyzing the data the

938
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:05,720
answer is yes in fact that is what he

939
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,480
commented there is a page called rtl cdr

940
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,270
where they will see that  you can hear

941
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:13,220
some such just by listening to the

942
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,530
frequencies you can go to this is using

943
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,660
the technology is the code of  such a

944
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:21,140
way, for example, talk is not enough,

945
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,270
but for example

946
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,950
there are many radio systems that, for example, the

947
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:26,300
communication that I from the health

948
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,820
or police system use quietly then

949
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,520
one afternoon you listen to a club like this I am a

950
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,260
specialist in imitating radio noise

951
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:36,110
but  You are going to see that this is different from what

952
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:38,779
we hear today that that

953
00:40:38,779 --> 00:40:41,029
tremendous radio limitation

954
00:40:41,029 --> 00:40:45,759
after this clearly and

955
00:40:45,909 --> 00:40:50,030
so it is fully set

956
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,490
then you cannot identify them and

957
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:54,500
you can come to realize if this is

958
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,020
a motorola tram kings for example if

959
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,940
you can tell if the question goes on that

960
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:01,280
side, the answer is yes, if you can

961
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,260
identify

962
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:05,640
that kind of thing.

963
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:09,210


964
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:11,010


965
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:15,239


966
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:18,039


967
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:20,650
as I have seen that

968
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:22,930
normally when I configure this here

969
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:26,440
that it goes to certain ports if I am not

970
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:30,449
mistaken, one of them

971
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:36,670
can be the rs 485

972
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:40,380
pu  It may be

973
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,150
the port, you told me the

974
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:47,830
wigan, the truth is, I am not sure, I did not try it,

975
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:50,960
I would have to try it as an organ,

976
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,320
I did not put myself fully with

977
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,150
all the latest generation cards, it

978
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:58,880
supports me, they take care of it and I have seen that one

979
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,160
of them has silences and that.  ported

980
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,400
william if not because they can

981
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,920
attack at a lower level also today and

982
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,590
when they are taking 01 the frequency

983
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:13,520
that becomes data and begins

984
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:18,590
precisely to analyze this then he

985
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:21,500
voted that cloning first

986
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,900
or second generation cards is too easy

987
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,280
no  Then exactly

988
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:30,090
and see who depends on whom because it

989
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:32,790
is that person who has permission to

990
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:34,980
enter and open all the doors, they are

991
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,350
inheriting all the same permissions as

992
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:40,610
the card to be explored,

993
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:44,980
exactly if or thanks to notifying

994
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,270
the ballast of the first

995
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:48,359
generation cards as is.  Guys are

996
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:50,230
present more these of these

997
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:52,270
vulnerabilities but the funny thing is that

998
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:54,010
good or at least good here in

999
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:55,569
Argentina many of these  cards

1000
00:42:55,569 --> 00:42:57,910
continue to circulate they are still in

1001
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:00,040
common use it is no more in fact good this

1002
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,190
card that we made three of the hotel is

1003
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,660
not no I can not say there is no action

1004
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:07,680
next a hotel in las vegas

1005
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:10,960
is common it is common that is it is a

1006
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,609
dvds hotel with is  more I can show you that

1007
00:43:12,609 --> 00:43:16,540
after showing you do not know what I have

1008
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:18,490
when I fall into the mess I have with all this

1009
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:21,130
from the computer and I want to show you

1010
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:24,130
so that you can see that it is true it is

1011
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:27,700
true look and there you can give the

1012
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:30,020
other side no

1013
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,240
but  no matter what happens, a lot of

1014
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,700
these cards remained that they remained that way they

1015
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:37,220
continue to circulate and well nothing

1016
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,560
is still being used it has to be

1017
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,300
backward compatibility and well they are still

1018
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,810


1019
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:47,460
accurate in fact more than 85 percent of

1020
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,230
all access controls that I have

1021
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:51,000
Being able to see and visit me, I tell you about

1022
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,750
critical infrastructure such as an airport,

1023
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:56,790
not candy terminals, such

1024
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:59,990
as a bank, and

1025
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:02,730
even some hydroelectric plants that

1026
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:05,700
are using

1027
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,910
first and second card technologies.  The generation

1028
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:11,190
is never a lot of wheel in a lot of

1029
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:14,160
things and everything that is your income they

1030
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,100
have it that way

1031
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,890
2 so there are those who have to be a

1032
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:20,300
little aware in fact I

1033
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,620
showed them a little what the

1034
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:25,540
fourth cards are  generation that enters

1035
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:29,090
not if you look at this card I

1036
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:32,180
explained to the public that it brings in this

1037
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:34,850
chip that here the encryption of the entire

1038
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:37,040
card and in this other joke here the one

1039
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,880
time password so that it is inviolable

1040
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:43,040
tilting the card does not bring more  Viable

1041
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,610
that is, you would have also bring

1042
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:48,200
all the antennas both for

1043
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,840
more frequencies and for frequencies and not being able to

1044
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,390
not be able to go steele update and take

1045
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,450
the others

1046
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:57,040
sir

1047
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,100
is incredible and what is in fact I

1048
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,500
noticed a lot in what is physical access in

1049
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,090
In general, we have a little what

1050
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:06,580
nfc or type of systems referred to, so we

1051
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:08,320
use to control their trade is that

1052
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,240
many times they are more

1053
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,910
implemented on a base this I do not

1054
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:16,570
tell I always do not I

1055
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:18,400
I am also participated in the community of

1056
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,590
the chopping a community of picking

1057
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:23,140
from Argentina and I have organized several

1058
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:25,210
for years, the challenge of the ctf

1059
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:27,220
of the picarnos and one of the challenges

1060
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:29,470
many times but two or three

1061
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:32,170
times there was a safe one  I saw it

1062
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:34,800
was closed and it seemed impenetrable

1063
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,170
and nothing people tried there it was two

1064
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:40,150
days three days and could not open it

1065
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:42,520
could not open and the secret is that it was

1066
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,440
open they realized by accident

1067
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,810
because they moved it and it opened by itself and well

1068
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:50,020
that one  He says it is a road, it is

1069
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:52,600
a simple thing, it is something that happens a

1070
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,750
lot that maybe puts you in the

1071
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:58,570
nfc referee system and one of you starts a

1072
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:00,010
hygiene attack.

1073
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:02,710


1074
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:05,920
even the system

1075
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,900
where I may have that whole system

1076
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,150
and leave the door open, leave the door

1077
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:12,880
open, pass a lot or well,

1078
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,850
that's also there, there is a

1079
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:18,190
talk that you can't really see  wild

1080
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:21,340
west hacking with which they use that they explain

1081
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:23,860
how they enter different environments

1082
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:25,540
other than that they will already do so by saying

1083
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:27,280
access, such as the distance

1084
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,020
left between the latch and the door,

1085
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,460
then they can pass a kind of

1086
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:33,100
card between them so that it is

1087
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,590
pressed and that  It is a crazy thing it

1088
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:37,780
is crazy that it is with something so simple

1089
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:39,730
when they put a lot of money so that

1090
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:41,860
good during the technology is made

1091
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:45,550
sure so that as a moral they invest a

1092
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:47,290
little more in access control that is

1093
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:50,170
definitely not being done

1094
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:53,170
today  The technology advanced so much that the

1095
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:56,200
door can control that with an

1096
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,000
access only between one person

1097
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,010
because doing another authentic problem and a

1098
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:02,650
half to all my friends then there

1099
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:05,530
are already technologies such as breaching

1100
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:08,440
allows you that a single person with a

1101
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,350
single authentication is not the famous  and

1102
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:14,800
for 42 and like those from there the same

1103
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,020
doors can be integrated by

1104
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:19,660
access controls the same doors can

1105
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:21,760
weigh entry  and exit to

1106
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,280
avoid complaining about pockets and a lot

1107
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,260
of other things that is technology in the

1108
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,210
access control part has advanced a lot

1109
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:31,120
so for the whole community

1110
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,670
advice is always made or take a

1111
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:36,670
little more attention in what  It is

1112
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:39,910
something that is too important than the

1113
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:41,920
physical income to your company because

1114
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,960
everyone earns a lot of money from the

1115
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,390
payless firewall and everything for the

1116
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:48,280
logical income but we are

1117
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,260
forgetting about the physical income and

1118
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:52,120
most of the attacks are also happening

1119
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,090
out there

1120
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:57,060
totally totally good dear

1121
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,550
francisco I think there are no more questions

1122
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:01,570
for now

1123
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:03,370
I want to thank you once again

1124
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:05,110

1125
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:07,960

1126
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:11,800
so good thanks for all the support

1127
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,440
for all for all the support and good

1128
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,050
only as I said these objectives

1129
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:19,210
fully live and there we have tried

1130
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:21,220
to do our best to talk a little

1131
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:22,870
about access control because

1132
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:25,120
electronic security is also part  From the

1133
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:28,630
conversation about cybersecurity touch

1134
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:30,670
so thanks for contributing more cisco I will

1135
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:33,040
leave you there with the public so that you

1136
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,870
can say goodbye to them and of course

1137
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,580
I will invite you, you can

1138
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,520
also enter to fight and that way they can

1139
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,410
find out in public  What have

1140
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:44,020
been given? There is a question that I am

1141
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:46,000
actually also talking to each other

1142
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,790
that I can now that we cannot be

1143
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:50,320
physically at least virtually

1144
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,780
we are going to make contacts and be there with

1145
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:54,820
the community so francisco without more

1146
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:57,880

totally at 8.8 Andean time  It

1158
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:24,250
is my first time here I am happy

1159
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:26,200
to stand out and good to the agenda and also

1160
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,060
the truth that a

1161
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:30,490
spectacular decision and I passed it from the phase of 10
