1
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,610
good morning again to the entire

2
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,799
8.2 fandila community we are going to

3
00:00:10,799 --> 00:00:14,219
continue with the second speaker at

4
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,260
this time it is my turn to be the

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,779
precisely good presenter of

6
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:21,300
youtube specialist and credit but

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,789
save the cybersecurity issue not

8
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:26,699
with Mr. Fernando Cornish

9
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,980
since  Tell him a little about

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,220
Fernando Energetica, the people

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,470
ibersecurities coach, but he wants

12
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,239
many years of experience

13
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,949
in the cybersecurity service for

14
00:00:37,949 --> 00:00:39,110
government entities,

15
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,120
banks, means of payment, etc., is a

16
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,380
woman's exhibitors at international events such

17
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,690
as Alberto Paris and

18
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,020
Saiz La Paz el dolor con el Dragón.

19
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,940
8.8 the center and more so that an

20
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,399
acquaintance arrived in Spain, he also led the

21
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,590
official instructor of certifications in

22
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,180


23
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,530
cybersecurity management and direction of

24
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,890
cybersecurity and has a series of

25
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:07,020
certifications also in the area

26
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,660
so Fernando at this time is going to

27
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,540
give us what  is the conference quite on

28
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,910
the mobile in real life goes so

29
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,910
e  Dear Fernando, feel at home and I

30
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,550
leave you with the entire 8.2 Andean community

31
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,650
so that they can illustrate us convert

32
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,360
your presentation

33
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,400
great great thank you very much for the

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,070
presentation and also for the invitation

35
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,320
to this event I hope it is being seen

36
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,760
correctly on the screen I would

37
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,990
appreciate your confirmation

38
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:42,390
great then first of all I

39
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,310
must thank you for the invitation

40
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,960
today we are going to talk about what is the

41
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,720
supply feet mobile this

42
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,270
specific publication of waters aimed at

43
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,710
applying the risks of mobile applications

44
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,440
and why to real life because

45
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,930
I am going to do  reference to cases cases that

46
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,820
will occur in the world news of

47
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,950
an international nature and I will also

48
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,830
be presenting to the groups of two of

49
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,420
the scenarios by which I have

50
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,280
come across when auditing the

51
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,960
applications of some of my clients

52
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,490
obviously all completely  It is

53
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,490
explored with the due authorization and

54
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,160
in cases in which it is not possible to

55
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,560
censor these sufficient  Without losing the

56
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,410
evidence, new files are rebuilt

57
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,870
to a new reference, that is, they

58
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,520
are files made to measure for the

59
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,590
example,

60
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,709
so with that preamble that is what

61
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:32,330
we expected from today's talk

62
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,510
and also mentioning you, they already introduced me to

63
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,040
my name is Fernando Conil  You have already

64
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,989
mentioned several of the things that I have

65
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:40,670
done on this side of the

66
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,590
technology in cybersecurity but

67
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,810
above all I like I would like to be

68
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,510
remembered for being a person who loves to

69
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,900
take technology, breaking it in

70
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,510
half or the end with the purpose

71
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,640
Obviously that improvement is established

72
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,280
so that it is safer for the

73
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,900
next security test

74
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,379
and before and a little more preamble for

75
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:06,540
what has just suddenly been given

76
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,780
but steps that is cybersecurity

77
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,239
penetration tests the ethics of

78
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,849
hacking this  then play and make

79
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:16,709
the man new year no time this logo is

80
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:18,329
completely known or we are

81
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:21,689
talking about the waters logo waters is a

82
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:24,269
covers is an organ  ization made

83
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:28,140
up of enthusiastic experts and

84
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,599
cybersecurity professionals who are constantly

85
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:34,319
creating reference publications

86
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,079
in reference to application security,

87
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,700


88
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,010
so speaking of

89
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,870
application security and some publication that is

90
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,980
the top 10 water or it does not exist top 10

91
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,140
is focused on talking  of the

92
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,569
main risks for the security

93
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:53,640
of podcast applications now we have

94
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,420
a broad panorama of what this top is,

95
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,790
we are going to go through each of these

96
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,400
sections throughout the talk in the

97
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,650
limited

98
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,480
time so let's start in section number

99
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,690
one, wrong platform  used that

100
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,450
happens developers are development teams

101
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,529
who tend to ignore the

102
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:18,839
use of security mechanisms that already

103
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,089
come and are available within the

104
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:22,889
operating system or within the

105
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:24,630


106
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,030
mobile application development platform, which means the

107
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,010
security mechanisms exist but not  are

108
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,040
used perhaps due to ignorance

109
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,169
by  implementation difficulties and

110
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:35,490
because so that the application does not

111
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,889
work it is necessary we simply

112
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:40,290
save ourselves the effort of applying them to

113
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,690
investigate more to use these

114
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,639
mechanisms which is usually a

115
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,950
security problem because we are left without

116
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:51,090
defenses that we should have down

117
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,510
this category of

118
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:58,980
Security risks also encompass the Portuguese

119
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,500
lack of use of good programming practices,

120
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,910
speaking at a more

121
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,910
general level with things are the good

122
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,669
practices of the mobile environment and another thing

123
00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:10,440
is the programming practices

124
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,830
throughout the environment, according to that.

125
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,340
We have examples here

126
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,500
such as the inappropriate use of tows

127
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,530
there is from El Quiché and this is precisely

128
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,450
what we are going to talk about the following

129
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,340
sites Pérez I have

130
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,300
interesting news and it is that a method was discovered,

131
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,790
this is no longer a problem of the

132
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,700
development of  applications but it is

133
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,979
a problem that was a problem at the

134
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:41,210
time of the same ios platform

135
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,729
which allowed  unlocking the phone

136
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:48,840
without having the power to step eyes in this

137
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,980
case

138
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,260
the security problem that equates

139
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,120
both of the shelves both on the side of

140
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,010
the winders but that it was on the side

141
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,410
of the provider of the platform in that

142
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,060
sense we also take into account that

143
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,090
the platforms  The same mobile phones can

144
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,100
have security problems and when it is

145
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,170
discovered at this level its impact is

146
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,450
much greater

147
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,610
since it affects a huge number of

148
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,250
devices that have the

149
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,040
affected operating system version

150
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,140
now let's move on to a scenario this

151
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,450
example is very interesting already

152
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,090
happening  next to android and hopefully

153
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,040
it looks good but if we do not apply it in

154
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,550
a simple way this file

155
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,710
is the android manifest the android

156
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:34,100
manifes is responsible for

157
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,870
enabling configurations when

158
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,570
compiling an application for if it is

159
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,670
within those configurations we have

160
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,310
the  attempts and above all the

161
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:47,130
permissions the permissions that the

162
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:47,870
application

163
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,210
will have what happens in this case  or it tends to

164
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,070
put at risk the security of the

165
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:56,040
applications and of those and of the clients

166
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,980
that at the end of these applications is

167
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,640
that permissions are usually requested

168
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,710
beyond those necessary for example that

169
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,900
we have a mobile application that has an

170
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,720
internet connection, it seems valid but

171
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,160
You also have permission to write

172
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,290
outside the assigned workspace,

173
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,510
which is a little dangerous, has

174
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,580
permission to send you sms,

175
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,890
which is why it is a malicious intention. Someone

176
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,200
could subscribe the owner of the phone to

177
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,500
a payment service and steal from him.

178
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,670


179
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,620
credentials to the accounts to read the

180
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,260
profiles to read the contacts and all

181
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,900
this could be valid depending on the

182
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,540
nature of the application in this

183
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,100
case these permissions are too

184
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,830
excessive it also has permission to

185
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,750
read it submitted not only for writing but

186
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,930
to read the external zone  from assigned to

187
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,120
its operation also for the leb the

188
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,740
call history all have a

189
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,410
series  of permissions that from afar look

190
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:55,290
excessive and that could be

191
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,000
used inappropriately by a malicious application,

192
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,210
so be careful although

193
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,100
the permissions team accept when installing

194
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,540
an application

195
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,120
point number 2 insecure storage

196
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,780
that happens that happens in this case

197
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,570
that the computers of  development think

198
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,270
or believe that the space assigned the

199
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,760
workspace for each of the

200
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,150
applications is a completely

201
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:23,340
inaccessible place and a safe place and what it

202
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,740
does is store sensitive information

203
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,320
there with information that should not

204
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,060
be there or for example personal data first

205
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,729
name last name  DNI and in

206
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:36,539
many cases this is what is saved in

207
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,460
these places are touches of the

208
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,370
application which can be

209
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,220
accessed even while in

210
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,560
the application workspace by some or

211
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,060
another application that is also

212
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,880
installed on the device, also this

213
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,880
in probability  this happens or

214
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,120
are magnified when we have a

215
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,400
rooted phone or that has  passed through the break

216
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,760
then we should not during the

217
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,590
development process save

218
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,780
sensitive information in the workspace

219
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,360
assigned for the application is a

220
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,330
dangerous practice that can end in

221
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,220
data breaches

222
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,160
a clear example of this is that

223
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,170
according to this study by  I do not know

224
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,740
that a few years ago one in ten

225
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,810
applications had a

226
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:25,610


227
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,390
data security problem

228
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,330
but 10 percent if

229
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,100
there were 10 million applications in the place tower,

230
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,590
a billion applications

231
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,180
have this problem a

232
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,850
considerable amount of new extras in those

233
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,860
dimensions

234
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,890
that  more interesting news is that

235
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:47,040
in one of the first versions we are

236
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,800
talking about telegraaf years ago this

237
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,740
well-known messaging application is

238
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,310
saving all the information such as

239
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,530
conversations and agents videos that were

240
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,960
shared by this means of

241
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,600
plain text messaging on a base

242
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,700
sql light data

243
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,630
as

244
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:10,380
is which put it at risk of

245
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,990
this information being  It is stolen by some

246
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,550
malicious application that is also

247
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,109
sharing surveys and now

248
00:10:18,499 --> 00:10:20,389
here we also bring you a

249
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:22,609
referential example of the things that are usually

250
00:10:22,609 --> 00:10:25,369
found when we talk about this type

251
00:10:25,369 --> 00:10:27,799
of security risk and that is that

252
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:30,259
sensitive information is usually stored in the

253
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:32,389
work area  Because if it can be a

254
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:35,269
database, it is encrypted for example or

255
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:37,699
also in the preferred country chalet

256
00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:40,339
file, this file usually stores

257
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:43,690
information that will serve us so

258
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,520
that it will serve us to have the pre-

259
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,500
ordered at the time of starting the

260
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,080
application without  However, we should not

261
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,420
have preloaded the step here,

262
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,880
apparently encrypted, to do the screen

263
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,730
, however, it is that it is encrypted, it is in

264
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:01,450
base 64, I am going to analyze it with an

265
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,070
online site, we realize that in

266
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,900
reality it is not even a

267
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,150
decryption process  but it is an

268
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,310
encoding I do not need to

269
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,820
modify it and we arrive at the plate value

270
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,200
showing that the emptying is not a safe place

271
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,670
or

272
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:21,720
ready internal let's go to point number 3 that

273
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,840
we have this is a censored example of

274
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,240
one of a test that we can do with

275
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,480
a client and what we see is that the

276
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,920
touch here we have no w and it already gives us

277
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,740
foot that this is a broker jw you  They are

278
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,470
encoded based on that play 4 and it is

279
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,460
tempered

280
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,410
I am in plan in the char file in

281
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,090
references so that today it is ready for

282
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:47,010
a malicious application to take it and

283
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,020
take the identity of the user of three

284
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:52,279
applications is what you access several

285
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,740
then these were also findings

286
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:58,370
of them because they are saving this

287
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:01,370
here they are to the free access of the

288
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:04,569
malicious software ready point number 3

289
00:12:04,569 --> 00:12:07,249
insecure communication when we talk

290
00:12:07,249 --> 00:12:09,139
about insecure communication we refer to

291
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:11,120
the communication that exists between the

292
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,819
client application and its server the

293
00:12:13,819 --> 00:12:15,350
server that is behind or

294
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:18,439
responding to your requests  These

295
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:20,449
security problems have a wide

296
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:23,420
range of possibilities or, for example, the

297
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,399
same lack of channel encryption which

298
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:28,730
means that  e do not go http encryption

299
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:31,939
as is, then the absence of additional controls such

300
00:12:31,939 --> 00:12:33,850
as the use of

301
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:37,309
safe and accepted protocols is not that of

302
00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:41,300
tlc 1.1 but the modern versions ls

303
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,699
1.2 1.3 that ensure a

304
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:47,960
completely private communication

305
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,590
also the use during it during the

306
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:54,020
during  The creation of this secure channel

307
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,220
uses different

308
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,160
cryptographic algorithms and several of them could

309
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,240
be duties such as the md5 rc4 sound that

310
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,700
could be available in different

311
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,860
during the number 2 during the

312
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,900
publication I am quite recurrent

313
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,330
although it does not seem that more the absence

314
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,730
of that seal  certify and ping that

315
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,500
help us validate the authenticity of the

316
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,850
certificate through which we are

317
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,890
connecting and avoid that we now have

318
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:21,950
an intermediary half of them are

319
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,899
trying only for the oscar had

320
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:27,240
also the use of self-

321
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,249
signed certificates and several other things that could

322
00:13:29,249 --> 00:13:32,040
put at risk  communication in this

323
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,829
case as you face everything between our

324
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:36,990
application and your service  dor a news to

325
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,749
know that its output

326
00:13:38,749 --> 00:13:42,839
is icesave brand is are is a

327
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:45,809
kind of smart watch for children

328
00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:47,970
that allow parents to know at all

329
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:48,720
times

330
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,850
where their children are in what they

331
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,040
are doing

332
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,139
but no matter how good the

333
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:56,550
intention seemed  a security problem

334
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,429
and that is that it had

335
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:02,129
decryption problems during communication and

336
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:04,050
allowed anyone with

337
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,360
sufficient knowledge to expiate

338
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,029
all this traffic and access the

339
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:10,589
location of all these children who

340
00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:12,179
used this is to look totally

341
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:14,009
dangerous looking for security

342
00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:16,050
we would make it more insecure  of our

343
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,850
children,

344
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,310
let's see, let's give this example, here we have

345
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:23,730
a screenshot of saving this tool

346
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,190
to inspect the traffic and we see

347
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,050
how it is possible to capture a request from

348
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,509
a crystal application of the http protocol,

349
00:14:30,509 --> 00:14:33,509
totally the text plate does not have

350
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:36,060
any, nothing had to be done other

351
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,120
than  put the sniper in the network to be able to

352
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,769
obtain this information due to the

353
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:42,740
absence of ci  Frado de canal

354
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,370
This is a fairly

355
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:49,410
recurring problem and I dignify myself to

356
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,149
advance you respond on foot or one that

357
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:52,800
a person who is dedicated to this can

358
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,279
deferr and realize but in

359
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:59,160
which part and a mobile application is the

360
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,600
green padlock that tells me that  My

361
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,360
information is encrypted, it does not exist, I

362
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,620
do not have to simply trust

363
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,540
the provider of the

364
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,699
mobile application provider,

365
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:10,199
so that's why I told them no, an

366
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,089
ordinary person who makes us use

367
00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:14,310
these tools could never

368
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,630
tell if it is information in reality

369
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,579
It is encrypted or if they are sending it

370
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:19,200


371
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,010
ready plaintext point 4 of insecure authentication

372
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:25,410
that happens with authentication and sure

373
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,810
that is a security problem that

374
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,590
transverse to any type of

375
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,800
application also to a web

376
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,810
application a desktop application could be

377
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:36,709
affected by this but the applications

378
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:39,009
Mobile phones have their peculiarities

379
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:41,660
because due to the more usability report

380
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,670


381
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,920
, many authentication processes are  and they

382
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,379
do it locally without consulting the

383
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:51,199
server according to

384
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,019
local authentication for these cases I have seen them

385
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,970
when it exists implementing a

386
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,589
local database in which the principality is saved

387
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:00,860
and it is started locally

388
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,869
without interacting with the server

389
00:16:02,869 --> 00:16:04,160
also well we use

390
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,670
biometric factors the phone itself validates

391
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:10,779
biometric information and gives access to

392
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:14,449
this is an advantage in usability but

393
00:16:14,449 --> 00:16:16,959
a security problem because

394
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,519
all the validation is done on

395
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,439
the same phone and using

396
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:23,019
reverse engineering techniques or it could not

397
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:25,040
modify the behavior  and the

398
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,949
responses of the telephone and to achieve unauthorized access,

399
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:29,540


400
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,250
likewise mobile applications

401
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,050
are also affected by traditional attacks

402
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,180
on authentication such as

403
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,540
brute force the use of dictionaries

404
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,480
to gain access and that is

405
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,560
all that happened

406
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,980
in this news with this publication of

407
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,440
hacker one in which a

408
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,560
security researcher managed to bypass the

409
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,720
s  The second authentication factor is what we

410
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,970
consider to be safe at the moment

411
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,740
for most mobile applications and

412
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,360
for the main applications in

413
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,850
the banking sector, but what happened?

414
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,939
What happened is that at the beginning,

415
00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:07,640
this banking application

416
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,130
used a

417
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,459
weak authentication or 4 digits or many attempts

418
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:16,730
available then I update it to a

419
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:19,400
more robust one with limitations and

420
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,099
attempts but what did I find

421
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:24,589
this researcher that

422
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:26,990
the initial version had not been removed from production

423
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:29,270
to be practiced

424
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:32,340
then he pointed to that initial version

425
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,530
He managed to identify himself taking advantage of the

426
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,990
bugs that existed and he got a good

427
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,049
reward

428
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:41,679
from this company that is dedicated to uniting

429
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,940
security professionals

430
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,000
with companies that are services

431
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,190
and something very similar was what we could

432
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:52,840
find our clients,

433
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,179
we will show it if they are not seen  and

434
00:17:56,179 --> 00:17:59,650
I am explaining them the same

435
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,370
and it is that during the

436
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,710
authentication process this c  client uses a

437
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,860
pin access pin a pin enough or a

438
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,750
more or less correct complexity were

439
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,240
six numbers four numbers

440
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,570
but the problem was on the side that it did not

441
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,700
establish blocking mechanisms look at

442
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,020
the number of requests that are

443
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,030
made without any type of blocking in a

444
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,880
way  They will have to face multiple

445
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,950
requests due to the complexity of the

446
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:28,740
pin, it was not feasible to make a

447
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,230
brute force attack and finally not receive the

448
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,910
message that you see below and it is requested

449
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,770
incorrectly because it could not be

450
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:37,230
verified but after many

451
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:40,950
attempts we had a successful result

452
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,740
and access to the application and

453
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,360
internal functionalities that

454
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,400
allow us a wide range of new

455
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,580
security tests that we could do

456
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:53,640
ready section number 5 configuration and

457
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,460
insufficient typography after seeing what

458
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,070
happens cryptography has helped to

459
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,010
protect a lot at the security level

460
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:03,570
protect the data in  Rest

461
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:06,529
protect data in transit and avoid

462
00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:09,860
exposure to coherent people  It is or

463
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:13,490
authorized, however, there are two

464
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,289
relevant problems in this sense,

465
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:18,350
first the use of

466
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,149
cryptographic algorithm mechanisms with

467
00:19:20,149 --> 00:19:24,799
weaknesses or like jaume the five rc4 and

468
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,180
algorithms of this

469
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,000
and the other problem, the inadequate implementation,

470
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,520
even if the work we

471
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,010
choose is very robust if  We do not

472
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,080
use it correctly if it is not

473
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,300
used correctly we will

474
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,610
have security problems again, these

475
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,800
failures range from using encryption keys that are

476
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,830
too short to choosing

477
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,620
modes of operation, although that is not a

478
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,390
mechanism to establish the process has

479
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,020
decrypted with modes of  operation

480
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,960
interest and then it goes from both sides they

481
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,500
chose a

482
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,660
graphical or simple minute algorithm to carry out the

483
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,840
implementation so both points

484
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,730
must be checked correctly

485
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:11,620
we already have news pressure for

486
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:15,640
damage and it is that a

487
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,420
security researcher managed to understand the logo

488
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,250
mechanism at that time this

489
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,860
WhatsApp messaging application used  ada to

490
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,740
encrypt the database in drink that

491
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,300
comes inside the device that you have

492
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,670
inside the mobile application to be able to

493
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,650
decrypt it and access the internal information

494
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,020


495
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,610
then very interesting your

496
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,140
research cannot do this by

497
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,030
placing if you gave your mobile home you

498
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,550
could enter  to any of the

499
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,320
confidential files within this

500
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,510
messaging application

501
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:50,740
that more than one example of misuse of

502
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,030
and poor implementation of

503
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:55,990
cryptography let's say is such a

504
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:59,590
common practice seriously every because it is what

505
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,410
happens we are going to tell Christmas is the

506
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,490
first time  that he made a

507
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:05,400
mobile application that he usually finds with

508
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,660
information that has not been encrypted

509
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,640
together he finds blowing the

510
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,560
memories I tell them a video mica look at

511
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,130
that is in plaintext it must be encrypted

512
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,450
but it must be encrypted in the correct way

513
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,850
then they will grab and begin to be their

514
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,370
mechanisms are to implement create their

515
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:24,340
task and when well understood with me

516
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,720
I see that they have implemented effective

517
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,460
encryption  Actually the file the information

518
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,460
is encrypted but what do they do as an action

519
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,020
to encrypt and decrypt my information

520
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,550
so that it can be used by the

521
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:39,910
service because in pebble the

522
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,950
encryption keys within the source code

523
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,930
thinking that this is a safe place

524
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:46,900
to store this information when in

525
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,240
In reality, that is a space that is

526
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,790
accessible depending on whether we are

527
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,809
talking about android, we can decorate the one

528
00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:57,429
on the bed and access all the

529
00:21:57,429 --> 00:22:00,029
information it has in this case,

530
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:03,190
then the encryption keys should not be saved

531
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:06,590
within it

532
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:09,110
within the within the center of the code

533
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,760
source

534
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,529
and another problem that is not

535
00:22:12,529 --> 00:22:14,870
highlighted is the impulse of the vector

536
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,760
initialization we have that everything is

537
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,210
set to 0 because it is a

538
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,880
default way, however the

539
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,820
initialization vector and its complexity helps to

540
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,340
generate only during the

541
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:31,190
cryptography process  so there is also another

542
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,350
example of the misuse of cryptographic algorithms

543
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,678


544
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:38,710
and I have just given an example of precisely what  s

545
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,320
mentioned

546
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,799
this is a censored example of our

547
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:47,190
clients and it is that here it is

548
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,350
referring to the fact that

549
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:52,440
the cryptographic algorithm

550
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,340
is being used to encrypt the information that

551
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,679
this application is handling,

552
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:01,440
however down here we have the key it

553
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,759
costs the  The key is not because it is already beautiful,

554
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:04,740
it is not valid so there is no

555
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,870
problem but we see how that

556
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,870
materializes in a real way

557
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:11,669
seen point number 6 and

558
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:15,740
insecure authentication that we pass the

559
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,029
authorization but we already pass the

560
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:20,519
authentication we already identify ourselves between

561
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:22,830
the system is user  password pring

562
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:25,080
fingerprint whatever and now we

563
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,509
are inside is now the

564
00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:30,769
authorization refers to although

565
00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:33,090
functionalities within the system

566
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:35,850
I sometimes have which I can use with

567
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:38,550
the profile role that left 5

568
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:42,210
in many cases this

569
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,260
access limitation is not correctly

570
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:46,110
implemented and  a user can

571
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,510
access functionalities or expected although they

572
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,000
should not have available  putting

573
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
the security of the application at risk

574
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,320
an example of this is one that

575
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,880
we have on the screen of this well-known

576
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,550
provider of software for

577
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:05,370
remote control of cars and it is that this

578
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:07,410
software has a security problem

579
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:10,550
that allowed the owner of a car to

580
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,960
modify  the forecasts that were

581
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,780
made towards the server that,

582
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,000
since this was not the case, the server established the

583
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,210
control to be able to access the information

584
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,820
in real time of other

585
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,130
connected cars at that moment as putting

586
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:28,170
at risk and understanding putting

587
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:31,490
the privacy of the owners at risk text

588
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,480
interesting the truth appeared very

589
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,760
interesting when the news returns and here it

590
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,670
is in a

591
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,990
generally censored example of our

592
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:42,690
clients and what it does is

593
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,310
quite simple the subject may not

594
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,440
look good very explain it in the first

595
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,810
request we have only one in the first

596
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:51,570
image  is a request refers

597
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:54,630
to the aini of user 406

598
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:57,060
and in more than this request the information is returned

599
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:00,060
Personal and confidential information of the

600
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,220
user between his first name last name

601
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,440
address of birth that is his

602
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,040
registration information in the application

603
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,320
using the same session as the

604
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,130
same peak I say of consumption what

605
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:17,130
happened is that by simply modifying

606
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:19,170
the name of the user's lady

607
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:21,330
we could  access the information of

608
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:24,000
other clients in that way and we are

609
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,490
integrating change of lady on the day

610
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,530
indicated as an automated process

611
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,600
the information could be stolen from the entire

612
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,300
database of this company good to

613
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,760
its clients that is to say that this is an

614
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,410
organization program  as they should

615
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,820
have access to ceres

616
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,580
ready point number 7 low

617
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:45,430
quality code what happens this is a

618
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,500
transversal problem also any

619
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,380
development process and it is that many many

620
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,840
web stock factories do not put emphasis

621
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,600
on the quality of their code they find it

622
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,240
in security problems  due to this

623
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,460
lack due to not following good

624
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,470
programming practices in many

625
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,770
cases these resolved so  I regret based on,

626
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:07,930
that is, failures at the functionality level.

627
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,760


628
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,760


629
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,260


630
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:17,170


631
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:19,440


632
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,850


633
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,650
For example,

634
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:27,610
let's see this was interesting and

635
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:29,830
it is also a couple of areas ago,

636
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:32,140
just what happened is that

637
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,540
a security flaw was discovered in this

638
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,820
message application and in WhatsApp with which it

639
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:40,540
allowed to take control

640
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,250
by means of the overflow of steam,

641
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,410
precisely what  we finish before

642
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,660
remotely from any device

643
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,860
that print has installed this

644
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,820
application

645
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,940
only by making a call

646
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,280
take advantage then census images

647
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:58,210
you receive a call and another phone to

648
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:00,340
generate a reverse shell and the

649
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,200
control body of these and vertical

650
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,210
ready let's see a code example of

651
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:07,039
low quality here we have an application

652
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,970
or a login and the section

653
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:12,289
where it is already  we master within the

654
00:27:12,289 --> 00:27:14,510
publication when our

655
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,280
most successful login

656
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,480
is what happens

657
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:23,420
we are going to show the disney saints

658
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,820
then here we have the

659
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,340
login we put our

660
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,710
application access credentials and what

661
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,510
happens in these credentials are

662
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,220
loaded in the  device memory

663
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,640
agreed and once they were used

664
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,070
to validate us correctly that

665
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,200
we are already in the system these credentials

666
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,900
are no longer necessary due to good

667
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,910
programming practices the application

668
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:49,250
should delete this information is

669
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,680
sensitive and it is no longer necessary

670
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,540
should delete the information from  any

671
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,540
memory space but chivas is an access

672
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:59,330
in the development process so a

673
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:01,850
malicious application that connects to

674
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:04,430
the original manufacturing process could

675
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:07,490
be a memory campsite and access

676
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,920
this information that still remains in

677
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,560
memory clear text and steal the  use and

678
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,960
password of this app all

679
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,640
because best practices were not followed

680
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,340
development

681
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,950
point number 8 also in the code

682
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,380
my two favorite positions are actually close to

683
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,820
first, the brilliant

684
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,100
code is that by using

685
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,070
third-party tools what we can

686
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:33,500
do is cause modifications at the

687
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,120
level of the digital code of the

688
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,370
application and if we modify  the

689
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:39,170
original painting we are modifying its

690
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:41,690
final behavior

691
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:43,850
let's see an example of this

692
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:47,059
here is a very funny one and it is that a

693
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,919
few years ago a fever was not with this

694
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:50,179
well-known application called

695
00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:53,210
pokemon and what did people start to

696
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:55,700
do they began to look

697
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,350
for security flaws  In order to

698
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,630
benefit within the game system

699
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,010


700
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:04,310
and what they found is

701
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:07,840
that by modifying

702
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,529
the original compilation, Africa could

703
00:29:11,529 --> 00:29:13,659
obtain different advantages within the

704
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:15,640
fire, such as being

705
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,520
geographically forcing the appearance of

706
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,890
the pokemon inside the father and  that

707
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:24,070
way he will have to have an advantage

708
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,960
over the other players this was

709
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,659
quick  Amente corrected and many

710
00:29:28,659 --> 00:29:30,460
accounts of this video game were

711
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,900
beaten

712
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,300
so here I show you an example of

713
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,950
what is the so print echo said the

714
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:39,020
tool par excellence to do

715
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,960
this is apk pool that what it does is to

716
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,750
compile but to disassemble a

717
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:49,850
compiled freckle while wearing it  From the

718
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:52,490
descent, he is the compiler to a code

719
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,170
a little difficult to try, this one

720
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:57,350
cast or for example quite simple and

721
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:00,020
below we have small is a pseudo

722
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:03,260
assembler that a little more difficult

723
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:06,680
but at this level at bad levels we can

724
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,780
modify as long as we know

725
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,420
back the behavior of the

726
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,490
application as we want without any

727
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:16,610
type of restriction or in this case this

728
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:18,500
application has a validation to

729
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,360
detect if the device is surrounded

730
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,510
in which case it will not allow the use of it

731
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,490
as a security measure,

732
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,650
however, searching for spam and

733
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:29,780
we can find or we can find

734
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,820
what is the function that performs this

735
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:35,200
action in this case we have to join that

736
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,380
verif  ica if the device is surrounded

737
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,480
and according to the result allows the

738
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,630
user to apply or not at this level in

739
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:45,430
small the

740
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:48,450
corresponding modification is made which ends up

741
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:51,340
modifying in the validation and

742
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,110
doing it the other way around as seen on the

743
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,199
screen

744
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,110
then what we have to do is

745
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,990
reassemble the application sign it and what

746
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:03,890
we are going to get is an application

747
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:06,840
that when the device is surrounded

748
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,090
tells you no and allows you to use in

749
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:11,510
this application this dangerous environment

750
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,980
never break your device at least

751
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,710
use it personally please

752
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,330
because the  they put in a dangerous environment

753
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:22,279
more vulnerable to attacks

754
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:25,820
ready point number 9 reverse engineering

755
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:28,389
I told you these are one of my favorites

756
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:32,840
so in general all code all

757
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,460
types of code are susceptible to

758
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:37,249
reverse engineering and the code of

759
00:31:37,249 --> 00:31:39,409
mobile applications does not

760
00:31:39,409 --> 00:31:41,809
escape this  problem some languages

761
00:31:41,809 --> 00:31:44,299
some compiled languages are

762
00:31:44,299 --> 00:31:47,149
more susceptible to this type of at  Well,

763
00:31:47,149 --> 00:31:49,359
for example, if we talk about the

764
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:52,729
android applications we can simply

765
00:31:52,729 --> 00:31:55,669
compile them and we don't have to go so we don't

766
00:31:55,669 --> 00:31:57,440
complicate so much with personal hygiene

767
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,049
in the case of airplanes as well as

768
00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:02,629
we have to go directly to the assembler

769
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,599
and online to start debugging to be able to

770
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:07,039
perform an attack of this type so

771
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,550


772
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,590
each platform has a different complexity

773
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,060


774
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:15,240
now what happens when we attack a

775
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,460


776
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,570
common application through reverse engineering techniques

777
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:21,540
and we know how to do it we can

778
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,740
do what we want with the

779
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,050
local behavior at least of the

780
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,760
application since this type  of

781
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,100
central mouse attacks has served only

782
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,630
affects the behavior of the

783
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:33,300
application in the execution environment in

784
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:37,669
other words within the device

785
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:41,430
we are also going to news of this type and it

786
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:44,400
is that a few years ago a band decided to

787
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,150
end it began to attack a series of

788
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:50,640
banks in  Europe but how is it that it was

789
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,520
so successful attacking those banks or why

790
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,540


791
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,360
and is it that these magicians who  Those who were its

792
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,770
victims used the same

793
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:03,650
library

794
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,810
developed by a company so that it

795
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:08,850
had several financial functions already

796
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,860
pre-installed, so this

797
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,170
library greatly facilitates the

798
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:15,420
development process of these banks accelerated them a

799
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,420
lot because everything was already done

800
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:21,240
but the problem was with this

801
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,300
This third-party library tool had

802
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,670
security flaws that could attack

803
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:28,710
using reverse engineering techniques

804
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,270
so as they all use the same

805
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,310
library and were from cybercriminals, I

806
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:35,580
knew the failure could affect all

807
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,929
this series of banks

808
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:39,610
interesting how many videos have been

809
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:41,090
taken

810
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:44,140
and well let's see a  For example, this type of

811
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:48,080
attack we are going to use an android and it is

812
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,590
that the compiled cars made in

813
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:54,560
android apply them and have a

814
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,120
characteristic that I had already

815
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,850
mentioned 10 that can be slaves in

816
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:01,280
that sense we can take the compiler

817
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,470
to compile it and access a

818
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:07,250
reconstruction  almost fidelista from the

819
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:09,980
original source code and  ting of the

820
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,050
operation of the application as its

821
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,040
reconstruction I

822
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,469
remember there could be sections of

823
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:17,480
code that are not reconstructed

824
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,210
correctly

825
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:21,070
and now we could do an analysis

826
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:23,260
from within the inside of the

827
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:26,918
box in that sense we see how when

828
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:28,839
inspecting the code we come across

829
00:34:28,839 --> 00:34:31,629
a functionality a bit  Particular that

830
00:34:31,629 --> 00:34:34,089
says here for everything to create a room that is

831
00:34:34,089 --> 00:34:36,940
only shown in certain

832
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,619
circumstances that are worth

833
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:41,550
this function everything is interesting

834
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:44,230
so how can we do to

835
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:46,510
show this button since the conditions have to

836
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,210
be met

837
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,530
simple we use one of the

838
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:52,210
most useful tools  important at this

839
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:54,250
time for penetration testing

840
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:56,770
mobile applications is frida frida

841
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:58,270
framework the framework for

842
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:01,000
dynamic instrumentation and joaquín

843
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,400
which is now being used by

844
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,430
everyone app and helping a lot in

845
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:09,210
what are security tests which

846
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:12,580
allows time  of execution modify

847
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:15,580
the behavior  Into an application in

848
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,070
that sense with Frida and this script that

849
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,570
appears on the screen, what we are going to do is

850
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:22,810
force the function that costs this

851
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:24,640
vote as this vote to

852
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,010
return true and show the world

853
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:28,960
when we want to,

854
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,810
then we execute we execute the script

855
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:34,570
we add it to the  process of our

856
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:36,310
application and what happens the following

857
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,920
that we do not see the button in the

858
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,560
initial situation we already have access to this button

859
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,320
the button create a user and how

860
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,820
dangerous a functionality like this could be

861
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,090


862
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:48,710
in what you can what can be achieved

863
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:51,110
with  dynamic instrumentation and

864
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,790
especially with dynamic instrumentation

865
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:55,070
also being a change in

866
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,020
runtime that will only work

867
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,150
on our phone obviously everything

868
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,430
affects the server

869
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:04,180
we will be able to avoid doing a bypass of

870
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,720
anyone

871
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,280
anyone any anyone without

872
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,530
exception of the security measures

873
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:12,580
implemented from the

874
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,370
perfect locale and we pass to point number 10 the

875
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:17,340
end point of this list

876
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,410
func  Strange ionalities that happen

877
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:22,630
Strange dysfunctionalities what

878
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,130
happens is that the development process happens

879
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,750
a lot of things

880
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,270
that is something so manual that people

881
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:31,600
finally do it and it is susceptible to errors and

882
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,520
that the one that can happen

883
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,740
may have a functionality that

884
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,930
is still in the process of being developed.  development that is

885
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:39,820
reflected is ready for production

886
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:42,190
but due to a problem in the management of

887
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:44,110
repositories this

888
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:46,750
incomplete functionality can pass to the

889
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:49,690
productive environment then the user in order to be

890
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:52,390
able to find this functionality and

891
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:53,860
surely being incomplete

892
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,090
it will simply draw attention

893
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:59,740
but if the functionality  incomplete

894
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,200
has not passed through

895
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,150
security reviews or implies a

896
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:06,400
critical functionality for the application we

897
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,580
could this error could put the

898
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,079
security of the entire application at risk

899
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:13,749
since it is an incomplete official

900
00:37:13,749 --> 00:37:16,059
that does not have security reviews the

901
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:19,170
risk of a failure

902
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,860
This can be of two levels.

903
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,330
Strange alities can be

904
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:25,550
found at the client level when

905
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:27,590
it is already within the

906
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:30,410
application code or at the package level or

907
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:33,560
when we can in production a service

908
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,500
that is going to be consumed by the application

909
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:41,140
but is not completely returned,

910
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:45,359
let's see an example to remember the

911
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,820
reference to  this already great example

912
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,859
there was an acquaintance has a huge

913
00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:51,420
tension but it is a well-known

914
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,119
messaging application it has also had a

915
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:57,869
factor a functionality that had not

916
00:37:57,869 --> 00:38:00,510
been contemplated during the

917
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,780
implementation requirements is the functionality

918
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,300
surely added by a

919
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,340
programmer or a

920
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,200
development service provider  to this well-known

921
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,440
messaging system which allowed

922
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,440


923
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,010


924
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:19,400
this programmer to

925
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,430
take the information from the

926
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:24,630
people who had installed this

927
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,540
application

928
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,670
that is the definition of a value

929
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:31,200
putting the security of millions at risk

930
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,680


931
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,940
our example in this case the one we are

932
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,730
going to  to review is that in the

933
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:42,010
development environment  or they tend to simplify several

934
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:43,540
processes such as for example I am going to start

935
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:46,900
a mobile session to do tests then

936
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,310
because I have to be very close to the

937
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:51,370
purple face hypnos password and the

938
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,580
network delays the testing process

939
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,840
so they did not come up with a better idea in

940
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:00,520
this case to create  A resource in the

941
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,890
backend that allows us to avoid the achievement

942
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:05,440
is simply when consulting it, leave us

943
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,320
within the application directly

944
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,000
here we have it is the resource of the obvious

945
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,670
and the way to call it was by putting the

946
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:16,810
word skate in the user's field,

947
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:18,700
let's do it more graphically  or as you can see

948
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,280
here, then when we do this directly

949
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,100
we leave it to ourselves and we could do tests

950
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,900
on the internal functionalities,

951
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,730
it was a bit and save a step

952
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:30,220
during the testing process, the

953
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:33,340
problem would be here if this

954
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,050
functionality

955
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:37,750
to the productive environment due to an error  in

956
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,820
managing repositories with such

957
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,740
dangerous functionality

958
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:44,620
available to any user and

959
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:47,860
especially to m agents  alicious among

960
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:50,590
cyberspace well so we reached the

961
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:52,540
end of the presentation this has been in

962
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:55,450
lowestoft and it is mobile focused on

963
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,590
real life

964
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:00,140
excellent presentation had fernando

965
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:03,580
the truth that leaves us many lessons

966
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:06,380
worries but I think it is the

967
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,030
main point to begin to become

968
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,850
aware  about what should and should not

969
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:13,720
be done we do not have any questions

970
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:18,020
Fernando that I am going to go to you I am going to

971
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:22,580
transmit a travel question in the case,

972
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:25,840
for example, we mentioned

973
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,720
when when I opened meditation, tell me

974
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,610
a lot of open qualifications that

975
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:33,010
can be very  well used by an

976
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:35,560
attacker in my case, for example I

977
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,710
use the advanced quintás no to close

978
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,510
all the applications that are not on the

979
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:43,480
bus and there is some additional application

980
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,900
that you can recommend us to use and

981
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,670
not leave so many applications open

982
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,650
because in the day  Today the truth is that

983
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:54,820
we always live in urgent matters and

984
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:58,420
we do not look at what is important, no and this kind of

985
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,150
thing like all the advice that  You

986
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:03,430
just gave us, we overlooked it very much and

987
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:06,100
the truth is that we contribute

988
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,990
to the attacker having the easier task,

989
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:10,480
there is no application that I can

990
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,520
recommend apart from the tape parts

991
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,370
to be able to safely close the

992
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:17,080
entire application

993
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,040
correct correct yes  Since you

994
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,840
mentioned, understanding many

995
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,730
installed applications increases the

996
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:26,620
possibility that there is malware and

997
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,930
that this malware tries to interact with

998
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:30,580
the other malicious capital applications,

999
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:34,000
so to answer

1000
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,610
your question I would give them a

1001
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:38,860
general regulation more than another application because that

1002
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:42,370
is what I know.  feel and it would be in 2 routten

1003
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:44,470
your mobile devices at least not

1004
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:46,750
the one you will use in your day to day

1005
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:48,130
to use financial applications

1006
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,200
for tickets or

1007
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:54,430
social networks no it does not protect them because this

1008
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:57,430
ends the encapsulation that

1009
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:00,420
each application has in its space

1010
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:03,070
so what I would recommend in that

1011
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:05,230
sense is that if you want to do a test

1012
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:07,120
s security companies acquire a

1013
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:10,030
simple telemundo television and do not break their

1014
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:13,240
end-use phone because it puts them at

1015
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,070
a much greater risk and increases the

1016
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:17,020
chances of an attack is when

1017
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,880
a malicious application tries to

1018
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,990
interact with their readable applications

1019
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:22,799


1020
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,600
perfect good room ask us to

1021
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,050
keep it updated help  To prevent

1022
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:29,910
attacks of

1023
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:34,360
course, of course, of all software and it

1024
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,580
needs to be updated at the level of

1025
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,380
functionalities and also at the level of

1026
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,170
security

1027
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:42,760
constantly the

1028
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,800
most robust mobile applications on the network

1029
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,430
support are released to

1030
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:50,080
security updates and have

1031
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,640
to apply them if they do not go  to be

1032
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,070
vulnerable to any of the failures

1033
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:55,810
that are being that are not being

1034
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:58,190
marked

1035
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:01,720
perfect good the habit that

1036
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:05,300
the smartphone does not do that we were

1037
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:08,390
looking for is more that more are ahead we

1038
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:10,220
asked where the plug was

1039
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,720
now we asked what is the password

1040
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,570
of the wef yesterday  so all the time

1041
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:17,570
we are connecting new networks  s Wi-Fi at

1042
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:20,330
the airport in the restaurant in the

1043
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:23,780
square of the place is public no but if you

1044
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:26,300
see the recommendation always use

1045
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:29,180
an app to avoid a

1046
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,760
communication point but when you have access

1047
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,270
to and not when you are when they take the

1048
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:38,120
trouble of when you are going to connect  to

1049
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:42,040
a network to a wifi network that you do

1050
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,930
not know, you do not know what level of security is

1051
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:47,780
behind, however the first thing you do

1052
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:51,100
is connect to a wifi network it

1053
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:54,869
is very difficult to do that bp n I am talking about

1054
00:43:54,869 --> 00:43:57,990
the average user because the first

1055
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:00,869
thing I am going to do  In the Basque sense, to

1056
00:44:00,869 --> 00:44:03,510
ask for the password and it connects you and

1057
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:05,849
assume that they are giving you the Serbian, they

1058
00:44:05,849 --> 00:44:07,980
are not giving you only the connection,

1059
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,260
security and responsibility, but

1060
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:11,940
as a team as courage, what we are

1061
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,040
seeing are principles, mainly the

1062
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,099
advice and within one of  the tips

1063
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:19,530
as the topic of having once bm told you

1064
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:23,250
this how simple or how

1065
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:25,680
difficult for an average user it would be to

1066
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,150
configure this in the wine fair ford in

1067
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:32,520
general I like  That question because it

1068
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,680
has a part that I am going to add right

1069
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,170
now that is not usually played

1070
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:39,780
recurrently and we are going to talk about the first thing

1071
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,990


1072
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:43,720
where it takes time or

1073
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:47,390
connecting via depends on simple the issue

1074
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:49,730
is that it also has a cost there are no

1075
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:51,740
free assets but everything would not trust

1076
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:54,220
a war of  graffiti then

1077
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:58,700
hiring a bbm line service is at

1078
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:01,580
a cost, it is very cheap, yes, and it will

1079
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,710
be easy to install it, achieving those

1080
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:06,320
accesses, I have seen, we are already

1081
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,880
protecting the privacy of our

1082
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,590
communications, it is the

1083
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:11,950
fundamental objective of the reputation that it gave us,

1084
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:15,200
but it happens  Another issue when

1085
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,290
faced with it when we connect to a

1086
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:21,650
public network is that we are going to this

1087
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:24,440
public network in which we do not know that other

1088
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:27,770
people are connected so these

1089
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:30,170
people are a potential threat

1090
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:33,140
we are only in the same network without these good

1091
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:34,850
in this case a  mobile device if it

1092
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:37,580
were a desktop computer a

1093
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,110
laptop to connect in that

1094
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:41,660
sense also a language not pod  We would

1095
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:44,180
have open ports services

1096
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:46,040
available on the network that are already

1097
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,060
susceptible to being attacked

1098
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:51,579
so that is another

1099
00:45:51,579 --> 00:45:53,200
us we risks that

1100
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,420
normally I do not know with this when

1101
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,099
we talk about a connection to an unreliable network

1102
00:45:57,099 --> 00:45:59,499
so in this case

1103
00:45:59,499 --> 00:46:01,589
losing are malware

1104
00:46:01,589 --> 00:46:04,420
enabled enable the firewall  of the

1105
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:06,430
device to avoid that any

1106
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,489
port is facing this network

1107
00:46:08,489 --> 00:46:11,589
because it is a network as an unreliable public selection

1108
00:46:11,589 --> 00:46:14,369
we do not know that other

1109
00:46:14,369 --> 00:46:17,380
people or malicious agents could

1110
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:22,440
be swarming in that same network

1111
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:26,930
excellent fernando bueno the habit from

1112
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:29,780
which everyone else comes  With

1113
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:33,740
authentication systems it is not more

1114
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:36,290
than one factor,

1115
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:38,900
and most of them bring facial recognition

1116
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:42,070
or iris reading or

1117
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:45,410
fingerprint reading.

1118
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:47,930


1119
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,540


1120
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:54,610


1121
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:04,890
to my fingerprint reader but

1122
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:07,530
then I have my ink and even

1123
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:09,140
when it goes  to an application

1124
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:12,359
I do the reading of william a mushroom

1125
00:47:12,359 --> 00:47:15,030
meeting and then it asks me to learn a

1126
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:17,670
special button that only I can press

1127
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:19,950
inside the device so I have

1128
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:22,680
three factors and even I could say

1129
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,380
that I am sure but what is the

1130
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,690
problem and well not only me  Anyone

1131
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:29,310
who uses those three security factors a little

1132
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:32,340
because what you have and

1133
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:34,800
something that you are then I have the three

1134
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:39,279
factors but the same two do not exist

1135
00:47:39,279 --> 00:47:43,599
and it was useless to have the three

1136
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:47,319
fingering factors if a player touch is

1137
00:47:47,319 --> 00:47:49,239
going to  throw overboard

1138
00:47:49,239 --> 00:47:52,029
access during all all the

1139
00:47:52,029 --> 00:47:54,189
forecasts when all the

1140
00:47:54,189 --> 00:47:56,590
authentication biometrics that

1141
00:47:56,590 --> 00:47:58,690
there is an application that you place

1142
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:02,140
that precisely may be late

1143
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:06,160
of coughing attacks at all when the forgiveness

1144
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:09,160
of touches when when defending it

1145
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,510
happens because you have seen

1146
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:14,470
pitifully  Nobody reads what

1147
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:16,300
an application is downloading and we are

1148
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,460
lazy to read the display see and we give it

1149
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:20,500
that we accept however it is in  letter

1150
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,170
that then played and they are

1151
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:25,240
telling us that they

1152
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,700
are not asking for permission and they are

1153
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,470
making a dedication to us and

1154
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:31,360
we are of the permission so that

1155
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,730
they can monitor our emails they

1156
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:35,950
can wait for what they

1157
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:37,630
want and called me  You gave permission

1158
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:40,930
through a wolf touch and that we

1159
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:43,270
recommend in this case further away of

1160
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:47,670
course read what that one is giving

1161
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:49,470
here we gave them permission because

1162
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:51,329
normally the displays diminished we have

1163
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:53,970
never another recommendation a little

1164
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:56,960
beyond eleanor full

1165
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,470
correct good he in  Based on what you

1166
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:03,480
also have to see that the

1167
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,440
security measures are aimed at

1168
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,050
covering a control on the subject, for

1169
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:10,990
example, biometric authentication measures

1170
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:14,530
are something that you know,

1171
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:19,990
then these three factors are

1172
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:22,550
aimed at protecting the authentication process

1173
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:24,260


1174
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,330
when  We speak again, we are already

1175
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:29,440
talking about authorization, that is,

1176
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,240
access to where it is going to have

1177
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,490
access to  Third-party application is at another

1178
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:38,870
level but this does not mean that it is highly

1179
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:40,730
recommended that being several factors

1180
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:44,900
is not now the issue of the out that

1181
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:47,110
we can do as a good practice

1182
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:50,570
to constantly check what applications

1183
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,510
have access is

1184
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:54,920
now I should have pampered and it would have been

1185
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,420
heard that  There are applications that

1186
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:58,040
inform you when a specific functionality is being

1187
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,540
consumed

1188
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:01,220


1189
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:04,190
but we have some in mind but

1190
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:07,340
what I would recommend is to be

1191
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:10,700
constantly searching or reviewing

1192
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,369


1193
00:50:12,369 --> 00:50:14,529
which are the applications that have

1194
00:50:14,529 --> 00:50:15,999
access to functionalities of the perfect month

1195
00:50:15,999 --> 00:50:18,430
to perform at  review because sometimes

1196
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:20,130
you do not even realize if

1197
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:23,380
one starts using an application as

1198
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:24,609
you say they do not perform the terms and

1199
00:50:24,609 --> 00:50:25,869
conditions they

1200
00:50:25,869 --> 00:50:27,549
simply catch a moment in

1201
00:50:27,549 --> 00:50:30,849
which you are not so attentive and you could be

1202
00:50:30,849 --> 00:50:32,920
providing those accesses without even being

1203
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,410
aware of then good remedy

1204
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:37,150
removing is  be

1205
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:40,089
constantly checking who has access to your

1206
00:50:40,089 --> 00:50:41,370
c

1207
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:43,650
In any case, the responsibility of a

1208
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:45,690
little more if we talk about the

1209
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:49,080
corporate device is on the unloaded side

1210
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,420
of the security, not because the other big

1211
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:53,090
problem is the authentication

1212
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:57,510
authentication is very weak or that or not

1213
00:50:57,510 --> 00:51:00,870
limiting the amount of attempt is not in

1214
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:05,670
order to be able to  This one

1215
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:08,160
does not break a password then many do not configure in

1216
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,680
fact that of not being how many authentic

1217
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,330
how many times to be able to authenticate you are

1218
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:15,500
wrong proceed

1219
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:18,380
well the recommendations more between 3 and

1220
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:21,740
5 depending on the risk that

1221
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:24,620
we want to accept but that there always

1222
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:26,420
has to be a limit

1223
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:29,000
and there is  strategies because they have to be

1224
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,630
used must be sabers and teeth

1225
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:34,250
then we can implement depending

1226
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:37,099
on your sector these locks as

1227
00:51:37,099 --> 00:51:39,049
soft locks and it means that

1228
00:51:39,049 --> 00:51:41,000
after a time and not now two

1229
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,290
hours if the access is returned or that is,

1230
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:47,869
we can try again or

1231
00:51:47,869 --> 00:51:51,500
hard locks which are necessary to do

1232
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,819
a password recovery process

1233
00:51:52,819 --> 00:51:54,950
or communication  Arnos with the

1234
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:58,579
support of the application, it all depends if it

1235
00:51:58,579 --> 00:52:00,049
is banking, surely it will be a

1236
00:52:00,049 --> 00:52:02,510
hard block if it is an application that is

1237
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:05,599
not so relevant, it is

1238
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:07,579
economically, although it does not have a

1239
00:52:07,579 --> 00:52:09,710
collection process for camps or cards are

1240
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:11,329
surely associated that we can use  a

1241
00:52:11,329 --> 00:52:14,210
smooth blocking process and several

1242
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:16,890
attempts or yes,

1243
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:18,630
perfect fernando we have a couple

1244
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:21,630
more questions from the public my daughter asks us,

1245
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:24,180
the one from mooring, is there an

1246
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,820
application that is free or not to be

1247
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:29,160
able to control its

1248
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,080
cell level at the company level, either at the level of

1249
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:33,360
updates or avoid the

1250
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,940
installations of secure applications

1251
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:40,510
and it seems to me that devices with

1252
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:42,520
less android tend to work very

1253
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,349
hand in hand with what Google solutions are,

1254
00:52:44,349 --> 00:52:45,210


1255
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:48,400
so at the corporate level they have

1256
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,160
solutions to implement

1257
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,230
multiple security policy measures

1258
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:54,670
that they edit, for example, that we  we put

1259
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:56,490
in

1260
00:52:56,490 --> 00:53:01,259
which we install certain things we

1261
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:05,490
examine security measures then

1262
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:08,070
we rec  Omitting that and if you check google

1263
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:10,290
as your rodents in that sense it is

1264
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:11,790
recommended to investigate among all the

1265
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:13,870
clean security sensors

1266
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:15,870
the mdm below

1267
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:18,300
yes

1268
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:21,130
perfect here I have other questions

1269
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:23,770
erico asks that it is advisable to have

1270
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:26,680
an old place the obstacle if the

1271
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,980
mobile is overturned that I have  I am more

1272
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:32,710
empowered by the one infected by vanguard and

1273
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:35,500
if not, where is the potential

1274
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,620
victim now or,

1275
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:40,750
in both cases, rooted not

1276
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,730
rooted, you have the potential to become

1277
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:45,760
infected with malware when installing

1278
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:49,240
an application from a reliable source or

1279
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,300
when a malicious mobile

1280
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:55,980
application sneaks into the application stores

1281
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,810
So in both cases of impossibility

1282
00:53:58,810 --> 00:54:01,300
of being infected, now the impact of

1283
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:04,420
infection is much greater if the phone

1284
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:06,490
is locked since the

1285
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:09,220
factory security measures have been removed

1286
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:11,740
to be able to do this process, it is not

1287
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:13,540
fun to have a phone here because

1288
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:17,200
the schools of its not  we have we can

1289
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,700
do whatever we want inside the

1290
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:21,270
device  We have a super administrator

1291
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:24,880
so we do a lot of things but they put

1292
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,910
a much higher risk in the event

1293
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:29,740
that he was surrounded so that

1294
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:32,800
is why I recommended this to use a phone

1295
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,960
for security tests where we can live we had

1296
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,760
fun doing what we

1297
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:40,900
want a devil and another for

1298
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:42,460
personal use  With the correct security measures

1299
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:45,800
and not surrounded by

1300
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,260
good Fernando I think that the

1301
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:52,970
mobile device has become that he is

1302
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:55,730
an instrument mother of us of

1303
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:58,280
the hands I think that a joint more

1304
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,170
attached to us because the truth is that

1305
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:03,080
we do not live for five minutes and saying

1306
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:06,440
we are  looking at the cell phone this is one

1307
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,420
of the topics I think the

1308
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:10,820
hottest and we could be chatting

1309
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:13,340
all day to see all of them almost without losing

1310
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:15,200
the emotion of what one is talking about

1311
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,210
what one is saying but

1312
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:18,130
unfortunately

1313
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:20,960
unfortunately time is our worst

1314
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,690
enemy  but I believe that we will have the

1315
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:26,330
opportunity to be able at some point to

1316
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:28,580
delve a little more only in

1317
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:30,890
this  Theme because as I was saying this is

1318
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:32,690
the day to day because we live with

1319
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:35,599
time and have it the

1320
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:38,930
appropriate solutions and above all the

1321
00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:41,330
proper care fundamental so in the name

1322
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:43,820
of eight together the Fernando de Tierra mine

1323
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:45,440
or first congratulate for their

1324
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:48,080
excellent participation then thank

1325
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,869
For addressing how much knowledge about this,

1326
00:55:50,869 --> 00:55:52,030
what is

1327
00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:53,920
our objective, which is that of the south of

1328
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,380
knowledge and democratize that of with

1329
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:58,360
knowledge so my thanks for

1330
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,190
contributing with your grain of sand this

1331
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,370
here or Fernando and we are seeing each other in

1332
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:05,620
a next opportunity that you  They can

1333
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:08,410
say goodbye to your audience that has seen

1334
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:11,080
that as far as it goes apart on

1335
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:13,020
social networks, I would

1336
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:15,430
also like to thank you for the invitation

1337
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:18,940
to be able to be again 18 to edit one of

1338
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:21,520
the talks in one of the editions that

1339
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,200
was eight shorts and I hope to

1340
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,820
find it again from some new one

1341
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:27,970
presentation of a new event of that

1342
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:29,320
nature thank you very much for the space see

1343
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,670
you later

1344
