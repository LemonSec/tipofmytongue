00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,760
okay so it's a huge very important topic

25
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,920
in our industry i know some a member of

very first brazilian

31
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,280
hackerspace here in the country okay

32
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,280
and they're familiar also that there are

33
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,480
many hacker spaces uh around in america

34
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,519
as well

35
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,879
so it's a great community also uh

invite everyone to get in contact with

38
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,760
your local hacker space and your local

uh comparative antagonia

45
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,319
so this case is steady uh it's a work

46
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,519
that we

47
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,319
done

48
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,760
in partnership with uh

49
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,640
the cyber security team at mit the group

50
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,760
of the

51
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,360
mit islam

52
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,400
okay

53
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,840
uh

54
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,400
our cto accessibility bank nelson allies

55
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,840
he is also a researcher affiliate at mit

56
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,159
so we did this job me nelson and natasha

57
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,640
barges from state bank as well and

58
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,760
uh

59
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,040
leaded by stewart madness

60
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,879
the intention of this paper was to

61
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,120
understand uh

62
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,000
to create actually a case study

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,840
of the data breach that happened with

64
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,040
capital one the u.s bank capital one

65
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,000
and we based it on this case study we

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,640
wrote down uh white paper and it's

67
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,639
available online so here you have the

68
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,440
link and the care codes to

69
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,358
have access and to download the paper so

70
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,440
it's freely available you can just go

71
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,960
right now and download the paper while

72
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,160
i'm speaking

73
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,919
okay

74
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,240
and the idea behind this paper was to

75
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,320
understand the

76
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,759
secured incident

77
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,320
that happened at capital one and

78
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,320
to figure out if the existing complies

79
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,880
requirements that we have nowadays they

80
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,360
would be enough to help

81
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,400
capitalist preventing the cyber security

82
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,280
incident actually the the general idea

83
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,080
behind this researcher is a broader

84
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,440
study to understand how compliance the

85
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,479
existing compliance and regulations and

86
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,759
legislation

87
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,560
around across the world

88
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,199
they are effective or not effective on

89
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,160
helping companies preventing data breach

90
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,400
okay

91
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,919
so let's go ahead

92
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,199
uh

93
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,639
as i said

94
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,440
the

95
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,199
idea behind this

96
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,680
research was to understand

97
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,400
the capital the the data breach incident

98
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,560
that took place with capital one there

99
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,680
was bank capital in

100
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,479
2019 okay

101
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,880
and based on the capital incident to

102
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,039
figure out if there is

103
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,960
enough

104
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,120
compliance requirements that would help

105
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,400
preventing

106
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,039
the incident so we will first of all we

107
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,919
will take a look at the capital uh one

108
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,880
incidence okay understand the incident

109
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,270
and then figure out which

110
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,560
[Music]

111
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,639
compliance requirements are in place or

112
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,039
aren't in place to prevent the incident

113
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,440
so as i said

114
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,199
we we decide to study the capital one uh

115
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,360
data bridge incident first of all

116
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,400
because it was a very uh relevant cyber

117
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,000
security its name that took place in

118
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,919
2019 okay uh it's very relevant actually

119
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,960
because first of all capital one is a

120
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,639
huge and important

121
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,080
u.s bank

122
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,160
they are recognized

123
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,400
as one of the most

124
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,039
technical skilled advanced banks in the

125
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,639
us okay so

126
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,840
they have a huge investment and

127
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,039
technology and security and actually

128
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,080
they

129
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,000
are

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,759
maybe one of the first or the main us

131
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,880
bank who decide to move the entire

132
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,560
infrastructure

133
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,039
ichi infrastructure to the cloud okay so

134
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,800
they had a plan

135
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,479
to

136
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,080
close uh

137
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,080
all their physical data centers and move

138
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,240
everything to the cloud as i remember

139
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,400
they had six office anchors these were

140
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,759
the centers

141
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,840
and the original plan was to move

142
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,199
everything to the cloud and actually

143
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,240
they did

144
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,440
okay so by 2020 they they had already

145
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,800
moved that

146
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,520
they are infrastructure from the cloud

147
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,560
okay so

148
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,800
so because of this they were uh a

149
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,160
flagship they were our case study

150
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,560
at our amazon website okay they were a

151
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,400
hell of an aws customer

152
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,160
and so it's a huge bank a very technical

153
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,160
safety bank uh

154
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,000
the first bank to move

155
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,440
the entire infrastructure from the

156
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,599
physical traditional on-premise data

157
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,520
center to the cloud

158
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,160
okay and all of a sudden unfortunately

159
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,199
they had a relevant security incident in

160
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,800
2019

161
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,479
where

162
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,000
an attacker

163
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,919
was able to

164
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,000
to

165
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,160
to penetrate the infrastructure and

166
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,759
steal customer data so they had around

167
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,560
100 million customers affected with

168
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,440
their personal and financial data

169
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,639
exposed and stole actually

170
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,599
and for example they their shares they

171
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,639
felt

172
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,039
six around six percent right after the

173
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,879
breach was announced so

174
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,560
you also had a huge impact to their

175
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,840
business

176
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,960
um

177
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,840
so if you consider everything so they

178
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,120
are very

179
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,280
it's a very relevant

180
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,120
uh incident actually they they got

181
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,760
presentation worldwide by the time the

182
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,718
incident okay

183
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,159
so as i mentioned uh

184
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,640
we we decided to understand

185
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,880
these capital immigration incidents in

186
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,680
order to figure out if they called

187
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,640
existing compliance controls and

188
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,640
regulations were enough

189
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,320
to prevent the breach to happen okay so

190
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,560
uh the the first question do we have

191
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,000
enough uh

192
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,640
requirements security reports that would

193
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,240
help preventing the bridge if so we

194
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,519
believed

195
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,360
if the

196
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,680
the requirements were well implemented

197
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,320
or not okay

198
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,959
so in order to do this research uh first

199
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:19,839
of all

200
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,800
uh we as i mentioned before we have

201
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,560
uh

202
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,880
the hypothesis okay so the current

203
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,399
scenario actually uh is that we have way

204
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,480
too much data which incidents happen

205
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,680
almost every single day so if you open

206
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,959
uh any

207
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,279
news site you'll easily see

208
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,760
some news about

209
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,000
[Music]

210
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,040
a major company a major business or even

211
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,560
a small business being having his

212
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,440
his data are stolen and leaked outside

213
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,279
the company okay

214
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,360
so uh

215
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,600
the question is if we have too much

216
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,720
incidents and if we if we have enough

217
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,880
regulations why is

218
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,880
this data breaching slats are still

219
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,839
happening you know so uh we had the

220
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,920
opportunity to be aware of the threat

221
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,680
because uh

222
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,720
it got

223
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,560
presentation everywhere

224
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,120
and we and we probably have regulations

225
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,360
enough to help the companies preventing

226
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,399
the locality incidents okay but as a

227
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,079
position instead of

228
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,079
of reducing the number of means that

229
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,160
incidents are increasing year by year

230
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,399
okay so we did an additional study

231
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,240
uh

232
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,000
almost in parallel with the capital one

233
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,519
study uh

234
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,000
by the way that we realized that in 2019

235
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,160
we had 20 more than 22 billion

236
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,240
personal information methods

237
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,120
worldwide you know

238
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,360
it's a huge number it's a huge increase

239
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,399
from 2018 and i'm sure that the figures

240
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,880
from 2020 and from 2021 are greater

241
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,240
greater than

242
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:02,920
the

243
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,760
2019-22 billion so the the bridge

244
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,640
incidents are increasing by over year by

245
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,440
year

246
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,160
and we are still vulnerable these things

247
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,560
are still happening you know so why it's

248
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,000
happening so

249
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,200
uh

250
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,600
do we have uh

251
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,480
global regulations laws and compliance

252
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,760
requirements

253
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,000
to provide a proper guidance

254
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,519
or

255
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,680
uh sorry we don't have the the proper

256
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,640
guidance or the companies are not

257
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,800
uh managing the

258
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,040
the complex requirements well enough so

259
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,440
they are still vulnerable besides the

260
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,320
fact that we have a strong regulations

261
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,040
like compliance requirements behind okay

262
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,000
so this is the purpose of this

263
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,600
conversation

264
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,399
uh in order to do this research uh what

265
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,399
we did first of all we

266
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,680
we

267
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,760
all the material that we had

268
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,560
from the capital incident okay

269
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,880
we understood the attack

270
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,519
step by step each step of the attack we

271
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,920
mapped each step of the attack to the

272
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,399
reach attack framework okay

273
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,399
which is a very good and strong

274
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,279
framework to understand uh

275
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,760
the ttps the tags techniques and

276
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,560
procedures behind and cyber attack okay

277
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,560
if you're not familiar with the need to

278
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,120
attack uh you should because

279
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,959
it's free it's something served it's

280
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,279
free available and it's very good to

281
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,880
understand how cyber attacks work okay

282
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,680
so we got the inspector incident we

283
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,680
mapped each step of the texture we need

284
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,800
to attack framework okay and basic on

285
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,959
the meter attack framework

286
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,440
for each step of the attack we map it

287
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,440
the compliance

288
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,160
that we get we got the attack step we

289
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,639
understood the attack step we map it to

290
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,200
meteor attack meter attack also provide

291
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,079
us

292
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,200
uh

293
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,360
mitigation guidelines and based on the

294
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,079
mitigation guidelines we mapped them to

295
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,040
the knee subsequent framework okay and

296
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,040
why it needs to miss subsequent

297
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,200
framework because it's also a strong

298
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,480
framework

299
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,519
uh

300
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,639
to understand potential mitigatory

301
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,880
security controls for all sort of

302
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,519
attacks and companies so uh

303
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,800
it's a very well-known widely recognized

304
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,000
global

305
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,760
uh

306
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,760
which applies to every company for

307
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,639
different segments and

308
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,880
it's very

309
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,880
very strong framework

310
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,399
to

311
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,519
to provide uh proper guidance on how how

312
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,160
to mitigate cyber attacks okay and also

313
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,240
you can easily find

314
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,320
on the internet on on a google search uh

315
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,120
different documents that might deceive

316
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,920
this type of framework to every single

317
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,160
regulation or legislation that you have

318
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,880
so you should go to google and say oh uh

319
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,519
how the nist's

320
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,880
super category controls are related to

321
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,480
for example

322
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,600
uh european gdpr you you google you can

323
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,000
find for local your local

324
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,399
legislation you can usually find someone

325
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,639
who read map the least substitute

326
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,720
framework to specifically regulation

327
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,040
legislation etc okay

328
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,760
so they are two good materials to help

329
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,639
us understanding house and attack

330
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,519
orchids and how to prevent uh cyber

331
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,720
attacks

332
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,920
okay

333
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,760
um

334
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,519
so this is how

335
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,079
how we did

336
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,160
and another reason to

337
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,959
decide to study the capital incident is

338
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,320
that we have

339
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,480
different for the majority of cyber

340
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,399
security incidents in the capital one

341
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,320
case we have

342
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,600
plenty of information about the incident

343
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,279
public available including the

344
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,279
investigatory reports that the fbi wrote

345
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,240
down

346
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,320
uh to explain uh how the attack happened

347
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,959
how they were able to identify

348
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,760
the attacker behind the attack and even

349
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,320
the the first mother had arrested okay

350
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,880
so we have plenty of material public

351
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,519
available about the incident

352
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,440
of course in order to provide to to do

353
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,399
such a research we need such material

354
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,279
okay

355
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,600
and the majority of incidents out there

356
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,759
we have almost no information available

357
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,160
you know we barely have

358
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,880
uh the news reports saying oh the

359
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,839
company x was attacked and that's all

360
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:38,959
okay

361
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,959
capital went as opposed to have a lot of

362
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,759
material we have a lot of blog posts for

363
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,279
companies and

364
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,680
security researchers discussing the

365
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,000
attack okay so we have a lot of

366
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,199
information

367
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,320
uh

368
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,600
in order to

369
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,680
to do this sort of research

370
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,920
which is very useful

371
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,399
okay so talking about about uh about

372
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,880
their capital and data bridge incident

373
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,279
uh we

374
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,880
we draw uh

375
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,920
a quick and visual timeline so

376
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,360
let's move okay

377
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,519
[Music]

378
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,480
sorry

379
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,720
too much too much

380
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,519
okay

381
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,120
so uh

382
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,759
i said i said that this name uh was

383
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,079
announced in july uh

384
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,320
2019 okay two years ago uh but actually

385
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,360
the incident started a couple of months

386
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,560
before this thing was announced actually

387
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,600
on march 12 2019

388
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,519
the attacker uh miss paige thompson uh

389
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,639
she had the first initial access to the

390
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,600
capital

391
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,639
infrastructure at ws okay

392
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:51,519
so

393
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,360
she was a

394
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,440
farmer a previous aws employee so she

395
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,800
knew a lot about aws how infrastructure

396
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,480
works etc has so she had a strong

397
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,319
background on on cloud infrastructure

398
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,559
and but she was not not working at

399
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,400
douglas anymore by the time of the

400
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,679
incident okay

401
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,119
so

402
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,559
she actually she wrote and scripted uh

403
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,280
script to search for vulnerable servers

404
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,280
expecting specific vulnerability that

405
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,400
she found

406
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,799
okay and actually she was able to

407
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,400
to attack more than

408
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,559
30 different companies in west the

409
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,880
capital one was just the most famous

410
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,520
targets from her attack

411
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,799
for her attack

412
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,720
uh but she's not attacking just the

413
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,240
capital one actually

414
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,039
but

415
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,600
uh again going back to the capital news

416
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,760
and then database incident on march 12

417
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,679
she was able to

418
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,720
to attack the captain infrastructure for

419
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
the first time okay

420
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,679
uh on april next monday next month on

421
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,600
april 21st

422
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,160
she had the access to captain

423
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,240
s3 buckets okay so

424
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,799
the that the database that captain had

425
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,120
storage on ws server

426
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,240
and she was able to copy to add access

427
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,679
and to copy

428
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,520
the data in more than 700 different s3

429
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,000
buckets okay containing customer data

430
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,799
so that the actual incident the actual

431
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,320
data situation happened on april 21st

432
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,440
okay

433
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,320
and

434
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,440
uh

435
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,600
actually the incident goes totally

436
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,919
unnoticed by the capital and the cyber

437
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,320
security thing so this took place on

438
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,360
april 21st and no one knows it's it's a

439
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,960
huge problem okay a huge issue

440
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,720
and actually on july 17 or which means

441
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,919
april may june july 4 months after the

442
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,400
data breach happened the data leak

443
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,000
happened

444
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,559
someone external researcher

445
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,799
found on github

446
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,000
a page

447
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,240
including some shell scripts that the

448
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,720
researchers say oh g-shock looks like

449
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,440
something from capital one and then this

450
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,919
outsider researcher

451
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,559
communicates send an email to capital

452
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,160
one should capture security team because

453
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,039
captain

454
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,559
has a responsible disclosure problem so

455
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,760
they accept uh

456
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,320
incident reports from external parties

457
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,360
okay

458
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,400
and then this person sent an email to a

459
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,640
captain and say hey i found this page on

460
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,799
that on github and it looks like stuff

461
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,799
something

462
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,559
that belongs to you

463
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,240
and something happened so please take a

464
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,880
look and then actually

465
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,919
uh the capital securities security team

466
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,440
uh

467
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,080
recently mayor started the investigation

468
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,880
uh realized that their data was stole

469
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,039
okay and then they

470
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,080
called the fbi 9011 called the batchman

471
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,280
et cetera in the red phone and then

472
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,159
on two days later on july 19 they went

473
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,200
public and announced the breach okay

474
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,240
so again the

475
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,720
what is relevant about what is first of

476
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,000
all the initial attack might unnotice it

477
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,240
no one realized that the data was

478
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,760
breached and

479
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,480
and leaked on april 21st

480
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,760
and the incident

481
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,520
was only

482
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,039
detected because

483
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,080
someone

484
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,720
a person outside the company

485
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,159
tell them hey i saw some data from you

486
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,520
outside of your infrastructure okay

487
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,440
so they did the incident

488
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,080
totally totally unnoticed for more than

489
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,240
four months okay

490
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,559
so it's clear that capital one favorite

491
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,480
should attack business

492
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,760
so let's go ahead uh then we we draw a

493
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,400
draft of each step of the attack so

494
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,440
based on the fbi investigation report

495
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,080
okay so what happened i would not go

496
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,480
deep into the tails because otherwise we

497
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,480
would spend like 30 minutes one hour two

498
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,080
hours just an incident but the attacker

499
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,960
first of all they she had her access

500
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,159
because she was using tar network and

501
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,799
vpn services to hide their original ip

502
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,559
address and then she run uh

503
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:27,000
ssf ssrf carry a query

504
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,720
service address for uri attack okay

505
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,400
to trick

506
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,360
the

507
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,480
the front end server who was running uh

508
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,120
a misconfigured web application file

509
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,240
okay

510
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,559
and basically because of this

511
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,080
this misconfiguration in their

512
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,720
application firewall the front earth

513
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,559
should the front and the server

514
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,480
uh

515
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,760
uh receive the the malicious commands

516
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,919
and provide it back to to the

517
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,760
infrastructure the comments okay the sss

518
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,600
ssrf

519
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,080
attack is like you using the request

520
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,720
your server the server misinterpret it

521
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,039
and forward it back to the back to the

522
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,559
backend

523
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,480
believing that this is the real request

524
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,679
okay

525
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,039
just a minute

526
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,440
okay so the capital m had a front-end

527
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,520
server running a misconfigured web

528
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,520
application firewall so the

529
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,799
fire didn't the titan even didn't block

530
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,400
the attack okay so the malicious ssf

531
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,440
query

532
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,640
uh

533
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,320
was sent by the by mrs page thompson so

534
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,080
she was able to access the ec2 metadata

535
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,280
service

536
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,640
and then she was able to get

537
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,440
access conditions through the capital m

538
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,159
infrastructure inside that applies

539
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,720
by using this credentials she was able

540
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,080
to access

541
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,919
the entire infrastructure she was able

542
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,360
to run command line uh

543
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,919
comments in the rare comments in the

544
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,120
command line

545
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,720
uh interface of aws and then she was

546
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,600
able to run comments like ls to list to

547
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,480
display

548
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,200
the entire list of buckets uh

549
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,520
and servers are available okay

550
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,159
and then she also run the command line

551
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,080
comment called sync which is

552
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,960
synchronized actually to copy the data

553
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,000
on the cloud environment to their local

554
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,120
computer okay by doing so by running the

555
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,480
same comment she was able to copy

556
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,080
the

557
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,840
all the 700

558
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,559
as

559
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,360
the data inside the 700

560
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,679
buckets on the double s took up to the

561
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,919
computer and then she was able to meet

562
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,159
the captain data which represented

563
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,760
around 30 gigabytes of information

564
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,880
and everything happened without capital

565
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,640
and security noticing that this

566
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,679
malicious was happening someone using a

567
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,000
tor network was having access to the

568
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,240
infrastructure someone using a tor

569
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,600
network was able to lease their servers

570
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,520
get credentials and the first is

571
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,760
containing data okay

572
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,000
so based on these six steps of the

573
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,559
attack which means i did access run the

574
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:16,159
malicious ssr ssrf query

575
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,400
uh trick the misconfiguration firewall

576
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,080
to relay the command

577
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,039
uh

578
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,480
get the set credentials run the ls

579
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,279
command and then separate data

580
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,520
using the same point so this is so from

581
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,679
these six different steps

582
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,200
we

583
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,799
we then map it to different

584
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,400
uh

585
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,520
knees sorry for from different nutratech

586
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,960
categories like

587
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,880
for example for the head access is

588
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,559
equivalent to the t1188

589
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:50,720
multiproxy uh category in the

590
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,600
the

591
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,640
meteor type framework and and

592
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,880
so on so far okay and then based on

593
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,159
each step for each uh meta attack

594
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,880
category okay we identified the

595
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,400
different

596
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
uh nice

597
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,480
subsequent framework

598
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,679
requirements as supercontrols that would

599
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:14,960
prevent

600
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,720
the data breach to happen okay

601
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,960
so i will not go again in details of

602
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,520
each of every one of these

603
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,200
uh steps for each of everyone of these

604
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,679
mitigatory contours you have them in the

605
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,080
paper okay because you take way too long

606
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,880
to discuss every single one okay but in

607
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,520
a nutshell in summary

608
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,159
we identify a total of 61 potential

609
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,720
missed the scsf cultures have actually

610
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,880
submitted categories that you visa

611
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,080
integrated potential mitigatory control

612
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,840
that would have helped preventing this

613
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,440
cyber attack to happen okay so

614
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,760
so from all the six different steps in

615
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,799
total we have 61 potential controls

616
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:03,840
that

617
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,679
if they were in place they were properly

618
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,679
implemented they would help preventing

619
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,760
the attack to happen okay so

620
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,279
as a comp so uh in summary the majority

621
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,600
of these controls were related to

622
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,520
vulnerability management

623
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,559
uh

624
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:21,600
triggered

625
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,520
the security principle of the least

626
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,840
privilege which means you just you only

627
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,960
provide user access or use privilege

628
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,159
to perform the right job okay not

629
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,960
unnecessary permissions

630
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,000
the lack of security and monitoring okay

631
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,159
and also the lack of

632
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,360
uh

633
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,679
implementing the proper security

634
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,039
principles

635
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,840
uh in their infrastructure okay so again

636
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,400
we have different uh

637
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,720
mitigatory controls that might have in

638
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,120
place to help preventing a cyber attack

639
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,840
as an example uh if you consider for

640
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,200
example the

641
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,679
step

642
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,880
four which is they

643
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,960
exploring the web then

644
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,080
the misconfigured application firewall

645
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,200
okay

646
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,520
uh we have seven

647
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,760
nist csf categories that were associated

648
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,159
that would help preventing this specific

649
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,799
step of attacking specific vulnerability

650
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,960
in the infrastructure okay

651
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,840
so during the initial attacks when we

652
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,360
staged thompson she was able to explore

653
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,600
the application file to

654
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,799
uh to send the malicious comments to

655
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,799
adobe data service uh we had again the

656
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,039
uh misconfigured mod security web

657
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,640
application fire in place in the

658
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,720
infrastructure okay

659
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,760
and there are uh seven different uh

660
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,039
nist uh super categories that will help

661
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,159
her detecting and preventing such issue

662
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,399
to happen okay so for example

663
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,120
if capital n had a proper vulnerability

664
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,799
management plan

665
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:07,760
okay

666
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,799
to

667
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,960
identify such a vulnerability such

668
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,159
misconfigured security tool

669
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,720
if they had proper outreach than logic

670
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,399
records okay and then using these logs

671
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,240
they would act

672
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,120
collect the data and correlate to them

673
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,159
and then monitoring these these logs for

674
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,360
authorized personal okay having access

675
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,520
and exploiting their weapon webbing at

676
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,760
each firearms configuration

677
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,159
if they use the principle at least they

678
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,320
would never use this personality

679
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,360
probably

680
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,840
the misconfiguration will never happen

681
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,600
if they had vulnerability scans they

682
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,960
would have to

683
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,440
detect the vulnerability prior the

684
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,799
attack

685
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,320
and if they have

686
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,399
detection of malicious activities

687
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,559
properly in place they would detect that

688
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,559
someone was exploiting their application

689
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,120
fighter okay and running a well-known uh

690
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,440
subsequent attack to the application

691
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,720
file

692
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,240
okay

693
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,919
so this is just one step of the attack

694
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,520
just for example in the paper we also

695
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,399
described uh otherwise so you can again

696
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:13,520
go back to the

697
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,720
paper and

698
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,960
read this more details

699
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,279
our analysis of what happened

700
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,200
uh

701
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,520
later the u.s regulator agencies they

702
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,640
investigate the attack they decide

703
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,880
they did they realize that capital win

704
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,200
was to blame about the attack and then

705
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,919
they finally have to land because of the

706
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,799
data breach okay and then we take a look

707
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,799
we took a look of the

708
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:41,600
the

709
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,520
the regulatory reports this is the

710
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,640
report about the decision on

711
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,480
finding the

712
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,840
capital one

713
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,440
and their

714
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,360
conclusions about the attack are very

715
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,679
similar to the computers that we had in

716
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,919
our paper okay so according to the occ

717
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,799
uh capital one fails to

718
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,360
establish a proper risk management

719
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,880
process okay in order to uh

720
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,919
engage uh any sort of potential standard

721
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,520
attacking in

722
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,000
the infrastructure okay

723
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,799
uh

724
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,520
including uh

725
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,279
proper risk mitigation from the cloud

726
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,880
infrastructure

727
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,600
and then they also failed to identify uh

728
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,279
the

729
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,760
the weakness and the vulnerabilities in

730
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,120
the infrastructure okay

731
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,120
they

732
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,440
even their technology whenever they

733
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,840
found some vulnerability was an issue

734
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,799
they were not able to effectively report

735
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,120
the vulnerabilities to the top managers

736
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,600
to different areas and then having them

737
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,159
working properly to feeds to mitigate

738
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,840
the vulnerabilities

739
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,799
okay and the boards the company board

740
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:00,000
was not held accountable for the

741
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,679
for the vulnerabilities of the risk

742
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,640
management process so no one just cares

743
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,080
about that

744
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,000
so their conclusions

745
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,320
match with how it pushes in our paper

746
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,519
and

747
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,799
so our conclusion is that unfortunately

748
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,799
capital really fails

749
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,640
in having the proper risk management

750
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,360
compliance process to help preventing

751
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,279
the data breach to happen okay

752
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,519
and we understand that they failed to

753
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,240
implement the proper these uh css

754
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,480
security controls that would help them

755
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,080
preventing uh from out of the six to one

756
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,600
as

757
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,799
michigan controls we believe that if

758
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,799
some of them

759
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,480
you don't need to have all of them

760
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,480
totally in place but if some of them

761
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,679
were in place

762
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,679
it would be enough to prevent the seven

763
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,120
attack okay

764
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,600
so my personal opinion for example

765
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,840
you will you would never allow

766
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,799
an

767
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,879
administrative access i would access

768
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,440
admin access to your infrastructure from

769
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,799
the internet

770
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,399
from iip

771
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,440
from uh atar exit node for example i

772
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,240
mean this is for me it's it's so

773
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,880
it's so quite obvious that uh your your

774
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,039
employees your

775
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,039
your it staff you never access your

776
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,760
infrastructure to provide support or

777
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,200
maintenance

778
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,080
using a tor network for example okay so

779
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,640
if they just stopped the attack when

780
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,559
they detected an ip address one turn it

781
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,480
doesn't be enough to provide that

782
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,399
okay and they didn't

783
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,240
do that

784
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,480
so this is one of the part of integrity

785
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,200
controls that they could have in place

786
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,880
and again they didn't detect the attack

787
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,399
at home so they don't have proper

788
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,240
logging monitoring

789
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,039
uh event correlation et cetera et cetera

790
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,159
so we got a couple of key discussions

791
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,320
about uh the conclusion of the attack

792
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,360
okay

793
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,399
uh

794
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,159
our first discussion

795
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:13,360
uh is that there are lack of proper uh

796
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,399
mitigatory controls okay uh and why does

797
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:19,200
happen first of all we have a huge

798
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,360
i mean it's good it's good and bad at

799
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,039
the same time okay because

800
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,640
for every regulation legislation or

801
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,880
or compliance framework that you have

802
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,600
you have a lot of requirements and

803
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,720
actually the company has the flexibility

804
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,679
to

805
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:36,720
define

806
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,000
which requirements they want to

807
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,519
implement or not okay because uh you

808
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,760
have a general regulatory framework and

809
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,039
then you have to chat back this

810
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,559
framework to our

811
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,720
home infrastructure to our own

812
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,559
reality to our our own risks okay so you

813
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,960
have to have such flexibility okay so

814
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,880
for example out of the 100 and plus

815
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,320
uh

816
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,360
mitigatory controls from the user i see

817
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,720
blah blah blah

818
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,840
you will decide to implement like 80

819
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,359
or 50 of them etc uh

820
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,359
this this at the same time it's good

821
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,359
because provides flexibility to adapt

822
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,359
the framework to a reality but at the

823
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,839
same time you have the risk to just for

824
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:22,800
what's implementing some key control

825
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,760
okay

826
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,359
so this flexibility is also a good

827
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,760
issue at the same time

828
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,679
so the companies they need to have

829
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,839
proper control of how they are

830
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,760
implementing the regulations the

831
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,280
security controls that create the

832
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,239
material

833
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,239
controls that they need to implement

834
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,199
okay so the companies must be aware that

835
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,440
you have the requirements and then you

836
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,320
have to be sure that we're implementing

837
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,719
the right requirements so this is the

838
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:56,079
first issue that we we realized

839
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,520
the second one

840
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,119
uh is the difficulty of a large company

841
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,320
to establish a proper a proper

842
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,560
compliance management proper

843
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,560
infrastructure and people

844
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,720
to provide the proper

845
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,839
proper

846
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,920
control of their compliance environment

847
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,520
the competency

848
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,839
requirements the compliance framework at

849
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:18,720
all

850
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,760
so

851
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,400
usually the companies they use like the

852
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,720
defense model and we establish two three

853
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,280
lines of defense usually the end user

854
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,599
the employee is the first line of

855
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,839
defense which means you are working on a

856
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,119
daily basis if you find something weird

857
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,480
you have to

858
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,960
uh tell your bosses they'll secure

859
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,200
extreme there they'll

860
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,880
let the complacent be aware that you

861
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,680
find something weird okay usually the

862
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,920
second line of defense is the security

863
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,839
and compressed team

864
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,760
usually the third line with the things

865
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,400
are the outsiders like the our external

866
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,200
auditors it's there no regulators

867
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,839
usually so

868
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:03,280
uh sometimes your end user finds an

869
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,200
issue

870
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,280
while they are reporting to the security

871
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,119
team and why the compliance team are

872
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,359
working on establishing an integrated

873
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,760
control someone just attacked that

874
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,160
company using the the issue that you

875
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,240
just realized that you have okay

876
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,119
so sometimes the attacker they exploit

877
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,760
this time window the gap between your

878
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,079
figure to have an issue again being able

879
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:29,760
to fix the issue okay

880
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,920
which means that you it's very important

881
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,400
to have a very strong

882
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,480
compromise management place so you

883
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,800
realize you understand

884
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,920
as fast as possible that you have risks

885
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,720
and you you be able to

886
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,200
search for mitigate such risks as soon

887
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,960
as possible

888
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,640
and so it's a it's a usual issue that

889
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,920
majority of our companies they have

890
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,440
uh

891
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,280
in the capital end

892
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,359
uh case in particular

893
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:03,760
we figure out that they also have a

894
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,839
people management issue as well

895
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:06,720
okay

896
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,640
so by the end of the day it's all about

897
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,400
people you know

898
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,200
so

899
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,880
uh

900
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,760
it's

901
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,440
very well understood that

902
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,160
the

903
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,839
this principle happened because of the

904
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,040
capital and

905
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,359
all infrastructure i mean oh it's hosted

906
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,000
in the cloud but the the final

907
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,240
responsibility is from the capital

908
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,800
institute's team okay to provide proper

909
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,599
security to their cloud infrastructure

910
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:32,400
uh

911
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,560
and as i mentioned before capital one

912
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,680
was very well recognized of techy savvy

913
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,280
uh a very strong bank you know

914
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,839
they actually they had a very strong

915
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:47,040
security team in the company that worked

916
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,960
peer-to-peer with aws engineering they

917
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,720
they also help

918
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,760
aws engineers building better security

919
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,280
tools by the way

920
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,480
but at some point of time they changed

921
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,760
their season

922
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,640
okay

923
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,640
and all of a sudden

924
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,599
the security team was faced with a toxic

925
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:08,800
culture

926
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,640
and everything was working very well

927
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,640
they changed the scissors and all of a

928
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,240
sudden the work was just crappy okay uh

929
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:20,000
people started leaving the company uh

930
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,480
so they have a huge heist turnover and

931
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,880
actually almost 130 of the

932
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,119
security employees left the company

933
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,400
in

934
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,200
lucky months a few months okay and can

935
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,800
you imagine going back to house of

936
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,359
having one pair of your employees

937
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,839
you are missing the security people you

938
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,320
are missing a lot of knowledge okay

939
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,560
people that knows too much about

940
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,320
infrastructure that's too much about the

941
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,440
top and you are replacing for new staff

942
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,680
so they have a long time to learn the

943
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,400
new job the new infrastructure etc so

944
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,760
this

945
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,800
this issue if

946
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,000
toxic leadership

947
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,480
uh actually helped uh

948
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,480
creating environment that the human

949
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,560
error will be part of the cause of

950
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,079
things okay

951
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,040
so part of the cow because of

952
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,560
uh

953
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,920
the breach is that the security team uh

954
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,760
had such an issue demolition

955
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,000
and then uh

956
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
when you consider everything what what's

957
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,839
their recommendations

958
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:31,440
um

959
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,359
what so initially

960
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:34,160
uh

961
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,000
this session actually the session

962
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,160
happens it's not in our original paper

963
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:38,960
but

964
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,480
we presented exactly this this this

965
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,920
exact same flight back to a has a rsa

966
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,440
conference

967
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,320
uh

968
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,920
two months ago

969
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,079
and in their city conference they are

970
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,839
they required all the speakers to

971
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,000
provide an applied session saying oh

972
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,960
okay

973
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,119
besides of everything i said so what are

974
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:00,960
our recommendations right what are

975
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,680
practical recommendations okay so so we

976
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,480
did

977
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,400
so

978
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,480
let's just see

979
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,000
this light transition was not very good

980
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,359
okay the presenter is not very good uh

981
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:16,319
so our recommendations for image 88

982
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,480
action so go back to your company and

983
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,079
start doing so

984
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,839
is first of all to review the most

985
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:26,079
recent uh compliance reports so you you

986
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:27,599
probably have

987
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:28,880
had some

988
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,560
compliance audits

989
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,720
a couple days weeks or months

990
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,680
ago

991
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,480
and then take a look of your latest

992
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,720
auditory reports and check with

993
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,640
everything is okay okay look for

994
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,240
potential weakness or potential

995
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,079
vulnerabilities for critical in your

996
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,319
abilities and start addressing them

997
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,400
start addressing the most critical

998
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,400
issues that you just realize you have

999
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,480
be sure that you're addressing them

1000
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,440
okay

1001
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,599
don't leave anything behind

1002
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,359
don't send everything

1003
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:02,640
down the carpets okay just start working

1004
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,000
on your latest auditory part and start

1005
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,680
checking if everything

1006
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,040
is well done

1007
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,839
okay double check your security controls

1008
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,599
uh included for our cloud compute

1009
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,000
infrastructure okay this time is a huge

1010
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,839
mistake that we usually

1011
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,160
see around the industry you have a

1012
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,200
strong

1013
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,720
uh

1014
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,440
integratory controls for our

1015
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,680
your own premise infrastructure actually

1016
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,359
because everyone is very used to do

1017
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:30,560
security

1018
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,200
in their own premise infrastructure for

1019
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,119
ages okay so

1020
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,640
uh since i was young i had i had i had

1021
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,720
hair okay we are talking about security

1022
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,560
in our infrastructure in our company

1023
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,000
your physical network like firewalls ids

1024
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,280
like yes anti-virus anti-pt

1025
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,480
uh

1026
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,680
expand control wherever whatever but we

1027
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,640
are not still very well on doing

1028
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,720
security in the cloud infrastructure

1029
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,760
okay so we have to be sure that all our

1030
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,400
security controls and mitigatory

1031
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,400
controls that apply to our physical

1032
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,720
infrastructure also apply or they have

1033
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,400
similar controls

1034
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,839
uh to protect

1035
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:19,280
our infrastructure on the cloud okay

1036
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,119

products different services different

1093
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,800
uh programming languages etc okay it

1094
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,880
applies to ever

1095
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,440
to everything

and

1097
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:52,800
from uh a longer time periods like uh

1098
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,160
six months

1099
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,599
uh

1100
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:59,200
be sure to manage your what we we call

1101
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,280
the compliance window so the time

1102
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,520
between you find an issue

1103
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,160
or you have complex requirements and you

1104
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,400
fix you you provide the proper

1105
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,720
mitigation

1106
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,680
we

1107
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,400
we understand that companies at least

1108
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,880
the the huge large companies they should

1109
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,040
have simply stimulate the

1110
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,040
traditional sock

1111
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,440
uh and knock so the network operations

1112
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,119
center the security operations thinking

1113
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,440
that we usually have in our larger

1114
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,520
organizations why we don't have a

1115
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,000
governance separation center okay why we

1116
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,200
don't have

1117
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,880
a team as a dedicated secured screen

1118
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,560
that is pitch for hours per seven

1119
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,400
looking for

1120
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,839
for

1121
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:45,920
compliance regulatory requirements if

1122
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,319
they are in place if they are properly

1123
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:51,040
implemented if they are working

1124
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,960
as you expected okay

1125
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,280
so we recommend that companies start

1126
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,400
thinking about building a specific thing

1127
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,880
just to work with the governance and

1128
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,119
compliance as that we already have with

1129
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:05,839
security and natural preparation okay

1130
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:09,279
our governance operations thank you

1131
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,920
that would help us providing ongoing

1132
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,240
monitoring okay and detecting any issue

1133
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,480
as soon as possible and working hard to

1134
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,480
fix them as much as possible as well

1135
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,920
last but not least

1136
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,960
we

1137
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,000
remember that you also have to

1138
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,280
work

1139
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,599
on providing proper leadership

1140
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,160
team and leadership team to manage your

1141
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,440
itu security team okay so

1142
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,040
uh having a strong leadership is crucial

1143
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,280
for some disability so having people

1144
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,359
motivated trained

1145
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:54,079
engaged on their job okay

1146
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:55,359
people is

1147
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:59,359
a strong part of the security ecosystem

1148
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,920
so we have our leadership realizing then

1149
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,640
and keeping the employees moral

1150
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,119
strong and people motivated and people

1151
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:09,280
aware of their work aware of the

1152
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,920
importance of the work okay

1153
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,440
uh

1154
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,520
you have you have to have organizational

1155
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,560
culture

1156
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,440
uh where people help each other

1157
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,520
instead of finger pointing

1158
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,319
you have to be more proactive you know

1159
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:25,839
so instead of

1160
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:27,839
just whenever having security incident

1161
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:29,440
just figure pointing and trying to

1162
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,079
figure out who is responsible for what

1163
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:34,480
uh we have to treat the difference okay

1164
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,400
so we have the learning opportunities so

1165
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,839
let's improve our infrastructure our

1166
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,760
people our process our technologies

1167
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,839
instead of just fingerprinting

1168
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:44,960
okay

1169
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,640
uh

1170
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,640
work we have in order to do that we have

1171
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:52,480
to work with our hr with our

1172
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,480
company with the sheep

1173
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,480
team in order to provide the proper

1174
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,079
strong and

1175
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:01,440
friendly

1176
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,319
company culture

1177
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,800
and working on police rotation policies

1178
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,960
and we whenever you think about the

1179
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,960
cyber security industry

1180
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,319
we have a strong a huge issue with lack

1181
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:17,359
of security professionals we have a huge

1182
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:18,240
gap

1183
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,480
between the number of professionals that

1184
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,240
we need in the industry and the number

1185
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,800
of professionals that we have nowadays

1186
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:29,280
and our universities our

1187
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,040
our schools they

1188
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,520
they were not able to provide the number

1189
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,839
of professions that we need in our days

1190
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:39,440
okay so uh i think the the latest

1191
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,559
figures from isa square is that we need

1192
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,000
around

1193
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:44,960
three

1194
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,000
million

1195
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,720
people to work in cyber security to

1196
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,599
to fill the gap between what we need and

1197
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,200
what we have today

1198
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,280
so it's a lot of people which means that

1199
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,000
the security industry

1200
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:58,880
lacks

1201
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,119
good and strong professionals so if you

1202
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:03,119
have one good professional

1203
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,520
take care of him of her okay uh

1204
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,160
work with him or her to to have this

1205
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,040
this person in your company to have a
