00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,990
Rafael is a self-taught passionate

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,310
about investigation and hacking,

8
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,500
specialist in offensive cybersecurity

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,019
and if he respects it, he has

10
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:29,480

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,570
experience in rating in the

14
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,149
energy industrial sector, being part of

15
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:44,610
implementations of por bertín

16
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,469
whose purpose is productivity in

17
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:48,390
defense and the reduction of

18
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,059
security risks applying for this the phrase

19
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,820
to know how and  where to defend first

20
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,760
we must attack thus also considering

21
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,350
the importance of the city and its

22
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,390
license in

23
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,239
offensive cybersecurity operations the title

24
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,950
of Rafael's presentation is cyberintelligence

25
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,219
in offensive cybersecurity operations

26
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:10,950
in this presentation

27
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,509
Rafael will show us an analysis of the

28
00:01:13,509 --> 00:01:14,950
importance of applying cyber

29
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,929
intelligence from the

30
00:01:16,929 --> 00:01:18,579
cartoonist's perspective  As

31
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,710
offensive cybersecurity operations to attempt

32
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,439
security breaches

33
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,619
forward Rafael

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,710
Hello, as they are, thank you, thank you

35
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,160
for the presentation, mishima brouwer, in

36
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,640
principle, I want to thank

37
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,500
18.8 for giving me the opportunity not to be

38
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,700
able to participate and share

39
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,200
knowledge with the community

40
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,520
today we are going to discuss a topic  I know that

41
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,370


42
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,670
many will be interested

43
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,710
in this capital is to apply cybersecurity capital this capital in the cyber

44
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,330
city of the cyber intelligence issue not

45
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,800
for operations to improve the

46
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,830
subject of operations if you allow me in

47
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,510
a moment I want to see how

48
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,250
the screen is shared here  Because in this

49
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,790
option I

50
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,470
do not have the option to change,

51
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,780
do not worry Rafael, we wait very

52
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,170
attentive,

53
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,409
ready, you can see on the screen,

54
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,210
okay, thank you, well,

55
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,650
as I told you, today's topic is cyber

56
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,030
intelligence in

57
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,110
offensive cybersecurity operations

58
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,960
if you see on the screen

59
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,900
if everything is in order

60
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,519
Good floor, who am I, I am Rafael Medina,

61
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,500
I am self-taught, this means that

62
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,079
Before studying

63
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:00,319
systems engineering and computer science, I started

64
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,909
my passion in hacking to

65
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:06,030
test the security of things and see

66
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,930
what to see, check not the assumption of

67
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,569
security, not of things, I am a

68
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:14,220
specialist in offensive cybersecurity

69
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,450
and for  reference I have

70
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,159
certifications as I thought that the

71
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:20,400
hardware was granted to practical and

72
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,040
among other certifications

73
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,910
in terms of my good experience

74
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,710
, it now has in the

75
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,470
energy industrial sector so I also

76
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:35,230
dedicate myself to this more than 12 hours a

77
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,299
day after leaving work  and do this topic

78
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:40,129
of

79
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:43,170
exercises not reptilian type work

80
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,239
with my laboratories my nick name in

81
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,790
cyberspace is radio hub and applied a

82
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,129
phrase that for me is very important

83
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,959
knowledge makes you free and prepares

84
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:53,670
you not to lose in the face of cybercrime and that

85
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,470
is why  that many of us are here today

86
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,840
participating in these conferences

87
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,239
because we are hungry for knowledge

88
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,680
we want to learn more we want to learn  er

89
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,569
something not that perhaps we may lack a

90
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:06,450
tip from one or another speaker to be able to

91
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,850
apply it in our day to day not

92
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,490
good we start with the

93
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,200
disclaimer the digital material of

94
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,940
this presentation is intended to

95
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,339
provide only information

96
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,630
therefore they should not be  apply the

97
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,100
knowledge acquired without the

98
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,870
explicit consent of

99
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,000
the owner of the equity audit

100
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,650
through a contract for the provision of

101
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,020
services dependency according to the

102
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,260
law that is, there must always be a

103
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,120
contract for the provision of services with

104
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,820
the legal area or with or signed by  the

105
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,380
director not of the company or of the

106
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,910
organization where this audit is also going to be carried

107
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:42,780
out, therefore,

108
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,100
all participants will assume

responsibility for the application of

110
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,330
this knowledge, the author and

the damages that may be caused by the

114
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,169
application of this knowledge,

115
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:58,300
the infor  Ation presented here presents the

116
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,819
opinion and perspectives of the author

117
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:03,039
regarding the matter and does not represent

118
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,349
any official position of any

119
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:07,210
associated organization, that is, I am going to

120
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,310
share my experiences based on

121
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,230
everything I appreciate from the two years

122
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:15,470
we already have on the agenda.

123
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,660
To discuss what cyber intelligence is,

124
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,170
we will also talk to point 2 that

125
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,610
we can find by applying its

126
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,890
intelligence or what we should

127
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:27,620
find in certain cases in point 3

128
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,850
we will have how to remove

129
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,250
cyber intelligence

130
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,660
as the intelligence series can favor

131
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,190


132
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,409
in the process of  cybersecurity

133
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:41,080
we are also going to see the data in the media

134
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,479
we are going to see in what cases are

135
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:46,180
leaks to obtain information that

136
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,770
can be used in our

137
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:48,750
investigations

138
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,529
we are going to also see this

139
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:56,849
on the web we can find sites

140
00:05:56,849 --> 00:05:59,009
that serve us will not serve us to

141
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:01,979
obtain information such as  the replication

142
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:04,199
of credentials of some organization and

143
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,409
a specific domain

144
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:09,519
and we will try  A point where

145
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:11,689
intelligence is thus applied in a

146
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:16,089
real case, we are just going to share,

147
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,720
well, that is

148
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,250


149
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,259


150
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:24,090


151
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,580


152
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,930
Mrs.  both the

153
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,259
cyber intelligence analyst

154
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:36,479
what he does is collect all kinds of

155
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,330
information related to a target

156
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,490
to support decision-making, not to

157
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,639
say to be able to take the remediations

158
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,690
and give the necessary recommendations

159
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:48,600
within some type of service that is provided

160
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,370
to a third party  or within your

161
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:53,039
own organization,

162
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,990
this is also used in

163
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,580
cybersecurity processes to analyze and

164
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,139
determine the possible actions of

165
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,060
cybercrime to prevent, identify,

166
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,820
locate and attribute attacks or

167
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,300
threats through cyberspace,

168
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,860
then within the cybersecurity area,

169
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,720
whether offensive or defensive

170
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,930
it is necessary to apply on intel  encia

171
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:16,600
because we need to know what possible

172
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,120
attack vectors are available on the

173
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,220
internet through the leakage of

174
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,830
sensitive information such as credentials or

175
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,440
devices, devices or

176
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,170
technological assets that are vulnerable and are

177
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,870
exposed to the internet and which can

178
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,090
be accessed

179
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,550
on payment platforms or also  In

180
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:40,410
free access platforms

181
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,639
and we can find applying

182
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:45,199
cyberintelligence because as I

183
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,110
mentioned not the 'latics' as you can

184
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,770
see in the image

185
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,310
here we have the IP addresses of

186
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,879
different devices in the world and they

187
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,590
are related to their respective

188
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,319
subdomains, in this case, treat about

189
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,810
Pepe in is how  We can see they are

190
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:09,190
different from pins, it

191
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,560
is a database that is exposed and

192
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,930
in which any attacker can

193
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,240
access this type of information and do

194
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,030
the validation with the respective one, it is seen

195
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,890
that the one to which it is related should

196
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:24,160
do the exploitation and this would affect a

197
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,320
good

198
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,390
one  critical to an organization

199
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,730
that has no identifi  After this type of

200
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,100
information, these

201
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,740
simple cybersecurity tests are therefore

202
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,429
important for organizations

203
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:42,350
within their

204
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,290
cybersecurity

205
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,630
and information security strategy to apply

206
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,430
in offensive cybersecurity and thus also

207
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,930
within offensive cybersecurity to

208
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,730
apply cyber intelligence to

209
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,880
be able to recognize all these assets that

210
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,600
are exposed

211
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,449
how to apply cyber intelligence

212
00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:03,709
as I mentioned this must be part

213
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,290
of the cybersecurity strategy

214
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:08,570
that is, if it did not have it mapped then now it

215
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,579
has to be within the club of your

216
00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:13,480
strategy plans not to be able to

217
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,399
identify precisely any type  of

218
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,620
information that is

219
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,200
aired or that is already exposed on the

220
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,660
internet is

221
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,240
[Music]

222
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:31,260
being space or also this was deep re

223
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,160
we have sources such as data in the media,

224
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,519
the best known we have is civil peace

225
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:41,510
among other types

226
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,270
of media where filtration

227
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:47,980
of  information we also have

228
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,410
social media in

229
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,150
This case may be telegram whatsapp

230
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:56,350
the popular groups where information is shared

231
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,930
and unfortunately there are people

232
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,970
who do not have ethics and also share a

233
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:03,310
database of information that should

234
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:07,290
not be due to an ethical issue,

235
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:10,190
we just have the forums

236
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:13,300
one of the best known forums is this

237
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,150
king  forums where a lot

238
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,910


239
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,910
of information of different kinds is shared and we also have

240
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,450
another source that is the afternoon in which

241
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,640
you can access using the

242
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,850
specialized author browser

243
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,710
or I commented on data in the media

244
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,930
a well-known platform space well

245
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,570
here we have a url for a matter of

246
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,090
confidentiality

247
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:46,880
We protect the url not so that we know

248
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,720
that there

249
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,459
are not many people who do not measure the

250
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:52,649
consequences of using this type of

251
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:54,839
information therefore it has to be

252
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:57,269
protected in some way in this type

253
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:59,959
of database they

254
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,060
are exposed we have the database

255
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,250
of different countries  as we can see

256
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,580
here in the red box

257
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,430
we have a database of mexico the

258
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:15,130
database of cr  edenciales de panama de

259
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:18,100
perú of certain services in which

260
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,680
each one specifies a different url

261
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,450
to be able to access that type of database

262
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,720


263
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,130
here comes something interesting the topic of

264
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,650
the forums and therefore here the cyber

265
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,000
analyst has to apply the

266
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,740
infiltration is  In other words, an account must be created

267
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,620
in any type of forum also

268
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,200
in the type of social network to be

269
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,180
able to access the information that is

270
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,040
passing through them, we are not

271
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,890
in listening mode and we do the respective analysis,

272
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,020
as in this case what we

273
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,510
have in the image

274
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,570
we can  find a

275
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:57,300
sainz apt user who indicates that he has

276
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,010
no credentials and they are at the sales of

277
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,940
vpn services for dinner in which he

278
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,920
even specifies his

279
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,230
email in mouse mail.com so that they

280
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:11,460
can contact the seller and at

281
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:16,390
the bottom we have the ip

282
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:19,780
workshop as a sign that I do know that

283
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,700
if the credentials in

284
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,400
which the users of

285
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,640
different vpn services specify and the

286
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,430
respective passwords once

287
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,860
people or potential

288
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,570
buyers verify that if it can be

289
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,210
accessed then they make the payment of what

290
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:41,670
this seller requests on this site and

291
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,440
obtain the information so that the

292
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,260
attacker or in this case also the

293
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,370
people who do something  type

294
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:51,370
of rafting equipment service men nor

295
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,740
can they validate if the

296
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,300
credentials of their clients are

297
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,959
exposed we

298
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:05,880
do not have the web that comes to be this

299
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,130
comes to be the sites the

300
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:11,100
dark sites within the internet in which

301
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,230
we can only access find

302
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:17,129
that  we can find we can find

303
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,529
precisely sites in

304
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:22,009
which validation of what types of

305
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,929
credentials of my organization can

306
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:28,589
be exposed in this case we have the

307
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:30,869
same domain and different credentials

308
00:13:30,869 --> 00:13:33,089
of that domain what has been answers

309
00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:36,899
we have the passwords in clear text

310
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:40,189
here  what happens the attacker

311
00:13:40,189 --> 00:13:44,100
what he would do is test not only the

312
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,550
domain name and  then you are going to apply or

313
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,379
zinc to be able to identify the

314
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:52,139
subdomains of that organization and what it

315
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:53,449
would do is

316
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:56,089
identify if they have ccs

317
00:13:56,089 --> 00:13:59,790
htl services or web services in which you can

318
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,410
approve the authentication with those

319
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,600
credentials and unfortunately there are

320
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,730
people who use their credentials

321
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:09,379
that is this credential  that we have

322
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:12,290
here can be used to access

323
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:15,600
even your ling account ling can be

324
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,579
used to access different

325
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:20,819
applications of the organization that is

326
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:22,589
why this type of information must be identified and mapped

327
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:24,240
within the

328
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,220
internet to take the

329
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,089
corresponding corrective measures

330
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:35,079
here we are going to  treat a real case they

331
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:37,449
applied web reason for the second time this

332
00:14:37,449 --> 00:14:39,990
is what our power

333
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:43,350
what happened good it turns out that an

334
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,120
organization

335
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,700
a windows server that was exposed

336
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,589
to its internet suffered an attack for

337
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:51,510
web reason all the information was removed

338
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:54,930
and the manager of haiti

339
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,520
asked for the support of four different consultants,

340
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,709
all of them supported because all

341
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:01,170
We will take the service is the

342
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,570
typical classic but within all

343
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,930
that analysis the Haitian front decides to

344
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,610
hire two of these consultants, not

345
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,500
one for the pen testing service

346
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,779
and the other to do a

347
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,690
sgs service and that is not to implement

348
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:16,709
the information security management system

349
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:17,570


350
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:20,310
so that to secure their environment and

351
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,950
to avoid having large losses because

352
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,709
always when a critical incident is applied or executed

353
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:28,290
or carried out with a

354
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,270
web reason they will always see large

355
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,399
economic losses

356
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:33,690
depending on the  time to stop the

357
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:37,010
services and here

358
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:40,200
all the consulting consultations

359
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,450
told the Haitian builder

360
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:45,660
not to pay the ransom at all, there is

361
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,460
no guarantee of any kind so that they can

362
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,580
restore the information so

363
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,490
they use the backups they had and

364
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:55,130
lift  Well, the affected systems are

365
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:58,019
good

366
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:00,869
once a certain time has passed, in this

367
00:16:00,869 --> 00:16:03,610
case a little more than a month and a half

368
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:06,160
the first incident and tuned to the

369
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,500
server p  Or that open test is

370
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,250
applied, the files were applied,

371
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,839
the secure information management system was implemented,

372
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,209
the chips were counted

373
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:19,660
that if many things were fulfilled, the

374
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,370
web of the same server was re-compromised with reason,

375
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:25,089
then what happened or

376
00:16:25,089 --> 00:16:28,120
is that question not asked  And everything has been fine-tuned and

377
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,390
the corrections have already been made

378
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:34,269
because the web reason is applied again,

379
00:16:34,269 --> 00:16:36,190
software will be executed on that same server,

380
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,350
not and as we see in the image in the

381
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:41,800
first attack they requested 1.5 bitcoins

382
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,620
when the peak in cost slightly more than 50

383
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,570
thousand dollars

384
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,370
and now in the second attack they request

385
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:51,059
three bitcoins

386
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:54,719
so the Haitian front is

387
00:16:54,719 --> 00:16:58,499
concerned it is logical we put them in the

388
00:16:58,499 --> 00:17:01,910
place of the Haitian front

389
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,579
and we will have great uncertainty

390
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,740
not to know what has happened if

391
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,849


392
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:10,619
good practices have been applied  has applied the

393
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:13,079
assignment is applied of pests and everything

394
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,240
to try to remedy these simple

395
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,609
security breaches

396
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:19,250
but he remembers not he

397
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,289
remembers that ad  The consultants

398
00:17:22,289 --> 00:17:24,569
had warned him that the attacker

399
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:26,369
could execute the web reason again

400
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:29,150
if cyber intelligence was not applied,

401
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,830
so the Haitian manager assumed

402
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,580
that all companies

403
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,260
apply the same thing, it does not mean they have the

404
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,970
same knowledge, but unfortunately

405
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:42,000
it is not like that and it is precisely  That is why it is for

406
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,640
this reason that I have decided to

407
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,250
develop this presentation, not

408
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,049
because what we all seek is to

409
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:50,909
improve our services

410
00:17:50,909 --> 00:17:52,390
either

411
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:55,570
as third-party companies that provide

412
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,820
services to certain organizations or

413
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,820
also to improve the services of

414
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,650
the internal services of the

415
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,150
organizations.  Not that they already have an

416
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,700
infraction that they already have

417
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,390
competent ters or their

418
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,100
incident response areas which must

419
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,550
be attentive to this type of

420
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:18,010
information to this type of events,

421
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,810
then to solve the Haitian front, it

422
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:22,420
hires the consultant that

423
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,630
gave it the  warning

424
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,670
good here the severe intelligence

425
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,320
discovered a flaw in the solution

426
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,940
Defense ion exposed to the internet, that is, in order

427
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,440
for it to arrive on that server, the

428
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,140
first thing they have done is access

429
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,070
through a defense service,

430
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,559
here we

431
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:41,570
cybersecurity consultants and operators

432
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,149
call this type of

433
00:18:43,149 --> 00:18:46,820
use is when defense serves us as

434
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,370
attack vector thus the defense serves

435
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,570
so that you can access the

436
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:51,429
organization

437
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:53,570
as you can see it had a

438
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:56,630
vulnerability cbs s 5 which allowed to

439
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:59,389
carry out for transversal where it was

440
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:01,009
possible to obtain the credentials of the

441
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:03,330
users of this solution

442
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:06,350
and therefore

443
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,440


444
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,950
these credentials are already  They were filtered

445
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,710
within a database,

446
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,750
as we see here, the solution was already

447
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,149
patched for that failure on the first

448
00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:21,490
day of the critical incident, according to the

449
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,800
analysis that had been carried out,

450
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,660
but it still had an outdated version,

451
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,290


452
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:30,120
the credentials had been exposed in a

453
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,870
forum for a long time.  a little over a year

454
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,360
and obviously the exploitation of these was

455
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,920
carried out before they update the

456
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,720
firmw  Are of the defense solution

457
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,730
what the consultant did is the delivery

458
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,400
of reports is to show the tests and

459
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,700
also in hot good access with

460
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,890
the beliefs of leaked towards the

461
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:56,190
defense service that was exposed

462
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:59,400
and it was possible to access

463
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,740
the manager of haiti were surprised and  the managers and

464
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,030
therefore the recommendations were given

465
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,590
not to make an

466
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:08,120
immediate remediation in which we can

467
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,679


468
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,809
prevent the attacker from accessing again

469
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:14,659
why

470
00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:17,059
we have even seen cases where an

471
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:19,220
organization has suffered the attack for

472
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,559
good reason up to a third time and

473
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:23,119
that is what we seek to avoid giving

474
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:26,390
improve our services to

475
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:29,180
be more critical

476
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,090
in our analysis

477
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:34,309
and not to settle not to question

478
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:36,440
what is it that we need to look for in

479
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,330
order to provide a good service

480
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,880
well here we are going to present an example

481
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,580
using the browser within the

482
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,210
garnett  come on here we have a

483
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:57,039
web service that is used

484
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,769
by reptilian red teams by penn testers so

485
00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:03,730
ta  It is also used by

486
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,429
cybercrime companies in which you can do a

487
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:07,710


488
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,670
complete validation

489
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:12,100
of your entire organization, that is, here you

490
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,040
can obtain information by placing the

491
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,230
domain name of the organization, the

492
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:20,140
credentials are already exposed or are

493
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,200
for sale on the internet

494
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,549
and this is  what any team should apply,

495
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:31,059
be it offensive or

496
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:35,019
defense, should know how to identify what

497
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:36,639
information is exposed on the internet

498
00:21:36,639 --> 00:21:38,590
so that to reduce

499
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,529
cybersecurity risks because as we saw in the

500
00:21:41,529 --> 00:21:43,620
previous example in the case

501
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:47,049
in the real case that this was not

502
00:21:47,049 --> 00:21:49,090
identified by that  10 more organization

503
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:51,010
in the company that gave the

504
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,799
pentes service could not identify that

505
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:56,850
detail or that point

506
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:59,750
then

507
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:04,100
within

508
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,620
this service what we do is the

509
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,720
validation

510
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,000
can be of an email or of the

511
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,830
domain as we can place here

512
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,620
we already have a  domain point pe and what

513
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,210
we are going to do is look for all the

514
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,820
email accounts that are

515
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,250
that have s  been

516
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,799
violated from which credentials are already obtained

517
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:27,960
and here we do not have

518
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,409
the air and as a result the user does

519
00:22:31,409 --> 00:22:32,549
not show them for a matter of

520
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:34,950
confidentiality the domain of the

521
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:38,580
organization this may be a bank it may

522
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,600
be

523
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,679
the company it may be an organization it is

524
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,750
a military organization  It can be

525
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,960
any type of organization and in

526
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,600
which it is already for sale these

527
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,309
types of credentials are not and we can see

528
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:57,639


529
00:22:57,639 --> 00:22:59,489
the password in clear text to be able to access

530
00:22:59,489 --> 00:23:02,579
then what the attacker will do is

531
00:23:02,579 --> 00:23:05,729
good now we apply or without

532
00:23:05,729 --> 00:23:08,259
identifying the subdomains that it has

533
00:23:08,259 --> 00:23:10,029
That organization is looking for

534
00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:11,889
web applications in which they allow us to

535
00:23:11,889 --> 00:23:14,619
do what I do or the ssh service or

536
00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:16,749
the tele service or any service

537
00:23:16,749 --> 00:23:19,869
that needs authentication and they are going

538
00:23:19,869 --> 00:23:22,179
to test these credentials and as

539
00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:23,379
I mentioned before for a matter of

540
00:23:23,379 --> 00:23:25,709
reuse of credentials

541
00:23:25,709 --> 00:23:29,309
unfortunately  there are people who

542
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:31,989
can come to use the same belief in

543
00:23:31,989 --> 00:23:34,539
different types of services and it is  to is

544
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:36,339
a practice that should not be carried

545
00:23:36,339 --> 00:23:38,049
out and this should be within the

546
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:41,720
policies of the organizations not to

547
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,320
create methods

548
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,789
for each user so that they can be

549
00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:49,360
identified differently in a

550
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,940
different application or in each application

551
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,960
of the organization

552
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,770
then with this it is  It shows that

553
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,420
sensitive information is there on the

554
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:07,390
internet, it is exposed, you just have to

555
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:09,850
know how to look for it and obtain

556
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:12,280
it, therefore, here comes a topic of passion,

557
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,170
not

558
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:17,350
that the researcher likes to go

559
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:20,800
beyond being non-conformist and staying not

560
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,360
with  what you have learned in a

561
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,840
certification course or a

562
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,120
hakim ethics course or you also have to

563
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,310
investigate has to do with how to

564
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,110
improve your services because that is my

565
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:35,680
idea not to be

566
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,800
out of the ordinary to

567
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,570
improve the environment in which we work

568
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,430
and  This will be of great benefit to

569
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,140
our organizations because we are going to

570
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,960
prevent cybercriminals or

571
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,270
curious people from using the credentials and being

572
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,360
able to  ccending organizations involuntarily or

573
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,680
for malicious purposes,

574
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,520


575
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:07,460
well, this is what I wanted to

576
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:12,260
share today, thank you Andean 8.8,

577
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,790
thanks to all the organizers for

578
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:16,690
this great event,

579
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:20,600
I have enjoyed Fernando's presentation

580
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,400
and I hope to continue seeing

581
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,920
more

582
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,410
knowledge

583
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,600
that is  They are going to spread the different

584
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,780
speakers who want to thank you very much

585
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,139
Roberts

586
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:40,900
thanks thanks to this rafael

587
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,420
his presentation has been very interesting

588
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,520
we are now going to the round of

589
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,250
questions

590
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,890
ok perfect

591
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,930
thanks to all who follow us for

592
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:54,150
their active participation and remember that

593
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:58,470
we are with  The Andean 8.8 hashtag

594
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,240
to see we have the first question that

595
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,820
comes from the norm asks us is it

596
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,770
possible to share the name of these

597
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:07,070
forums

598
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:09,640
for a topic of how I commented to them, not for

599
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,550
a matter of confidentiality or for the

600
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:15,310
security itself, not that many of the

601
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:19,389
people who are watching this event

602
00:26:19,389 --> 00:26:21,279
I can not give the names but it can

603
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,789
be one of the forums is king forums

604
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:27,429
publishes it  s you are going to be able to find it and what

605
00:26:27,429 --> 00:26:29,289
you have to do is infiltrate that

606
00:26:29,289 --> 00:26:31,659
forum and we will be listening, as I said,

607
00:26:31,659 --> 00:26:35,019
not be in listening mode and use a little

608
00:26:35,019 --> 00:26:37,299
search

609
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:39,879
with specific names for any type

610
00:26:39,879 --> 00:26:42,519
of word and get the links

611
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:43,600
from the databases  that are

612
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,639
exposed but this must be used

613
00:26:45,639 --> 00:26:47,679
with great responsibility it is not

614
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,419
about obtaining the information and

615
00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:51,789
playing games no that is outside the ethics

616
00:26:51,789 --> 00:26:53,559
no no it is not within the ethics of a

617
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:55,989
cybersecurity

618
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,119
professional  offensive or defensive

619
00:26:58,119 --> 00:26:59,950
you have to have a lot of criteria this is

620
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:03,190
confidential information in which one

621
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:06,159
can have it stored but you

622
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,679
can not export it that is, it

623
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:09,759
can be used to do searches

624
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:11,919
related to your investigation,

625
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,929
that is, if you are in a service suddenly

626
00:27:13,929 --> 00:27:16,119
if you have  the name of the organization

627
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:18,909
x and you go through your search in the

628
00:27:18,909 --> 00:27:20,320
domain name of that organization

629
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,279
x no so that you can match and show

630
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:26,859
a better result  Lots of your

631
00:27:26,859 --> 00:27:29,379
tests and that it gives added value to

632
00:27:29,379 --> 00:27:31,179
what you are doing not as work

633
00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:33,489
and that the client appreciates that, do not say

634
00:27:33,489 --> 00:27:35,440
you know that this if you are doing a

635
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,239
correct service because it is not

636
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,800
only

637
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,510
about running tools

638
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:43,610
as we say  No, it is not

639
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:46,430
that certain companies only run automated tools, they

640
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,380
do not even apply

641
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,930
bridges, that is, they do not explode and they only

642
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:53,060
run, they do not deliver the report and

643
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,800
since the client does not know, well, they

644
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,540
walk it or until finally a

645
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,640
consultant arrives that if  tells or you know that

646
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,320
you are these these tests that have been

647
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,750
done before because no they are not no no no

648
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,790
should not be

649
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:07,520
this service if there is definitely not

650
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,190
much sensitive information in

651
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,800
what is suddenly placed without

652
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,690
authorization from some forums or

653
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:17,660
exiles with rails  it is accessed and

654
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,080
often from the public domain and

655
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,040
unfortunately there are

656
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,480
malicious people we have

657
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,430
cybercriminals who take advantage of this

658
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:28,070
misinformation  On for their own benefit it is not to

659
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:31,730
damage this good the reputation or to

660
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,890
obtain some economic benefit, not from

661
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:34,780
the institutions,

662
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,730
in fact, they would deal with the

663
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:40,940
ethical issue there a lot, not about how one as a

664
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,950
security profession is facing

665
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:46,700
this information at hand, one this one does not

666
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,370
cross that border that

667
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:52,420
should never be crossed definitively after

668
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,350
one rafael get to the next

669
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:57,070
question by carlos valles does not

670
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:59,900
ask according to your experience what is the

671
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,060
greatest source of income for ram software

672
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:05,800
to the company's network

673
00:29:08,419 --> 00:29:10,730
we will be able to ask the question to  see

674
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:12,710
says second experience what is the

675
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:15,559
largest source of income of ransomware to

676
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:17,830
the network of the company,

677
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,630
good

678
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,610
of which we do reptilian or what we

679
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,230
do and see its pleasant offensive we know

680
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,509
that

681
00:29:24,509 --> 00:29:26,070
the bone reason can

682
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:28,079
remotely exploit that is to say happens that I see an

683
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:30,359
exposed vulnerability  towards the internet

684
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:32,639
of any type of service it serves us

685
00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:35,699
to be able to access that service and

686
00:29:35,699 --> 00:29:37,739
elevate privileges and once  one

687
00:29:37,739 --> 00:29:39,719
elevates privileges exist within a

688
00:29:39,719 --> 00:29:41,789
system can execute the reason

689
00:29:41,789 --> 00:29:43,679
remotely first local to upload it to

690
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,919
that server and execute it and mostly

691
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:49,859
execute it for web reason that is not one of

692
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:50,969
which their signatures are not yet

693
00:29:50,969 --> 00:29:53,779
recognized so that they avoid the

694
00:29:53,779 --> 00:29:57,239
antivirus to  to avoid mdr and

695
00:29:57,239 --> 00:30:00,179
other types of defense solutions,

696
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:02,729
therefore we must not only believe

697
00:30:02,729 --> 00:30:05,999
that today is the reason the web has not

698
00:30:05,999 --> 00:30:08,069
affected us because the user who does not know how to

699
00:30:08,069 --> 00:30:10,320
use

700
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,720
this email has downloaded any

701
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,179
file is not what we commonly

702
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:16,740
hear  That it is easy to blame the

703
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,960
user is not the first thing they do is if

704
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,730
the user is guilty but

705
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,730
nevertheless sometimes and in many cases

706
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,600
unfortunately the systems have not been

707
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,909
patched there is an exposure

708
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:28,440
of information leakage as

709
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,649
I mentioned is available and they took advantage

710
00:30:31,649 --> 00:30:33,570
That is why the attackers are inside and

711
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:36,050
all they do is because

712
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:39,740
as we say we get dizzy, the mother asks

713
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,500
for ransom, they pay the ransom and many

714
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,950
times in es  The reason services where

715
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:48,100
because now they are services

716
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,370
are for sale a desk a lick

717
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:54,669
can buy that service he can follow

718
00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:56,110
the instructions that are in his manual

719
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,900
execute reason web law for the ransom in

720
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,320
bitcoins and he has the will to

721
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,210
restore the services but not  They have

722
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,740
given you the manual to restore the

723
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,049
services. Hello, how can you decrypt

724
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:10,059
that type of service, then,

725
00:31:10,059 --> 00:31:12,970
therefore, you cannot pay

726
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:15,789
the 25 bitcoins for the disks they ask for,

727
00:31:15,789 --> 00:31:18,429
but there is no guarantee as we mentioned

728
00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:20,169
that you can restore the services.

729
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:21,700
that is why we recommend not

730
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,610
paying a ransom that we do we remove

731
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:26,440
the hard drive

732
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,389
we place another hard drive we make the

733
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:31,210
backup and that hard drive we save not

734
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:32,950
for a certain time because

735
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,960
some investigator will always be able to

736
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,750
decrypt that they will achieve or the

737
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,509
cyber police will  to obtain

738
00:31:40,509 --> 00:31:44,049
the information of that descriptor and

739
00:31:44,049 --> 00:31:46,149
they will publish it later that is

740
00:31:46,149 --> 00:31:47,470
what is recommended  save that so that

741
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:50,500
that information and you can this raise

742
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,169
your services again no and yes it is not

743
00:31:53,169 --> 00:31:55,120
definitely I do not know about the fact of paying

744
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,700
a ransom means that cybercrime is being

745
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,490
financed and we should

746
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,649
not ignore the possibility that

747
00:32:02,649 --> 00:32:05,350
later on some investigator or suddenly

748
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,389
The same creators of this type of

749
00:32:07,389 --> 00:32:09,490
malware, these ransomware can release

750
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:11,679
some keys or methods to be able to

751
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,330
decrypt the information, not as has been

752
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:15,700
given in several cases already before, not

753
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,879
if it is definitely very important not to

754
00:32:17,879 --> 00:32:21,580
fall before this type of extortion

755
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:24,490
that occurs in the  good cyber world the

756
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:26,080
next question comes from rafael inmates

757
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,399


758
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:30,129
in the question is in your personal opinion

759
00:32:30,129 --> 00:32:32,379
to make a good defense you have to

760
00:32:32,379 --> 00:32:34,640
know how to attack

761
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,169
well

762
00:32:36,169 --> 00:32:40,269
if it is

763
00:32:40,269 --> 00:32:43,129
important from the point of view that is to

764
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:45,950
say the defense is not based only on

765
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:48,049
buying solutions and  in art of a

766
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,269
lot of solutions but that are not

767
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:52,519
tuned in many of the cases and in which it

768
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:55,460
supports the subject  to know how to attack to apply

769
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,169
without seeing the offensive plant in which

770
00:32:57,169 --> 00:32:59,269
they are going to validate if

771
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:01,249
those controls, these defense systems

772
00:33:01,249 --> 00:33:04,159
work as they say they work or perhaps

773
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,529
they need to perform some fine-tuning

774
00:33:06,529 --> 00:33:08,029
therefore when a

775
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:09,590
solution

776
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:13,299
is passed the area is indicated  defense that

777
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:15,940
how was that bypass done and what do they

778
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,950
need or what is the remediation or

779
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,299
what is the overcrowding that they should

780
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:22,360
apply therefore I do consider that

781
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,970
the defensive area is to attack because

782
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,309
you cannot protect something that you do not see or that

783
00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:30,190
You do not know where these times are, that is

784
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:32,830
the basic thing from my point of view,

785
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:35,169
so to defend first you have to attack

786
00:33:35,169 --> 00:33:37,629
there you know what vulnerabilities

787
00:33:37,629 --> 00:33:41,499
exposed you have there you recognize that

788
00:33:41,499 --> 00:33:43,119
defense systems are not working

789
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:45,009
as they should work and proceed

790
00:33:45,009 --> 00:33:47,440
to overcrowding and  You also

791
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,379
recognize in what type of credentials

792
00:33:50,379 --> 00:33:51,879
as we have seen the credentials or what

793
00:33:51,879 --> 00:33:54,999
assets are exposed to the internet

794
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:58,179
in which any  An attacker can

795
00:33:58,179 --> 00:34:00,909
take advantage of that and generate a critical impact,

796
00:34:00,909 --> 00:34:03,669
not as a block everyone fears today,

797
00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:06,279
it is this that they attack you with

798
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:07,710
reason

799
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,690
for business operations,

800
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:12,739
money is lost and

801
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:15,119
generates great uncertainty, not because

802
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,909
sometimes neither backups work to

803
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:19,290
desist  of the cows but no one has

804
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,550
done the test that the cows are

805
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:22,219
working and when they want to lift it you

806
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:27,100
die, this is not another point as well

807
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,159
and it is definitely a fairly recurring case,

808
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:31,449
especially the

809
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:34,360
backup test and something that in my experience

810
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,280
has also had for  some

811
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,870
referrals and there are also some

812
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:40,120
contacts of companies that have been

813
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,100
victims of rne software in the first

814
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,949
time there is always sometimes a

815
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:47,530
second time not that in theory

816
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:49,810
the contingency measures are taken the

817
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:52,770
security framework is raised no but if

818
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:54,760
statute  that someone attributes to him is

819
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,400
that again they are victims of ram

820
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,920
software

821
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,359
good as I commented in the exhibition

822
00:35:02,359 --> 00:35:04,500
mostly when u  It is not a victim of

823
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,450
word reason is because the

824
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:07,920
initial attack vector does not come in the

825
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,980
case that I have now shown

826
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,420
initial attack followed by the same defense system,

827
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,250
not that nobody had mapped that

828
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,710
since it has been violated that it was already

829
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:19,109
those  The credentials were well

830
00:35:19,109 --> 00:35:21,000
exposed, they were given away for free and

831
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,579
not even for sale and anyone could

832
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:26,130
get to those credentials and be able to

833
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,930
test it and once they prove that they are able to

834
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:29,970
demonstrate which company or organization are

835
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:32,629
attacking or not,

836
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,720
straps in the middle begin to scan

837
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,640
all the services and identify a

838
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,839
server.  What may seem

839
00:35:38,839 --> 00:35:42,500
appealing to them and they run between the server,

840
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,260
the web reason is mostly on the

841
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,869
server, good in a service that has

842
00:35:47,869 --> 00:35:50,270
less protection and it spreads

843
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:53,410
throughout the network, it is formidable

844
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:55,270
if indeed sometimes the

845
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:57,940
corrections are not taken, it is 100%

846
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,700
percent or in the right dimension

847
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,290
here I have a next question rafael

848
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:05,200
to the question is the  s

849
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,430
requests for cyberintelligence services

850
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:09,029


851
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,240
here in the country and in Latin America, the

852
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,348
truth is, there

853
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,640
are few companies that provide

854
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,600
cyberintelligence services, it

855
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,180
is more this,

856
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,520
some companies give the

857
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,190
cyberintelligence intelligence service as

858
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,480
a plus within the

859
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,790
offensive cybersecurity service, that is to say  When

860
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:34,400
you do a test it is a service depends on

861
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,579
sting or a service of equipment pet us 90

862
00:36:37,579 --> 00:36:40,880
services or it can be a service of a

863
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,700
reptile type where it is considered that this

864
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,799
type of techniques is to be able

865
00:36:46,799 --> 00:36:49,619
to improve, not the service, not

866
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:54,319
not to look bad in the case of the  consulting

867
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,040
the unknowns in the same company as

868
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,900
how they have done it again that what

869
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,360
I lack has happened and that is the idea can this

870
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,250
presentation not that we all

871
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,920
focus a little more on looking for what there is

872
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,870
beyond not not being satisfied

873
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:13,810
when with  what we have already established

874
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:17,860
not within the processes of the

875
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,780
steps that are carried out in an ethical hakim

876
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:23,640
to a small common

877
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,890
and correct rafael to  Here I have two

878
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:27,630
more good questions, the first one is this

879
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:30,300
if you could not comment suddenly on the case,

880
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,550
you will have some notable case of

881
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,190
cyberattacks in the industry that you can tell us

882
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:37,640


883
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:41,130
how to give the name of an organization to

884
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:44,230
those referred, perhaps the way

885
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,680


886
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:51,680
suddenly how they can apply  that the reason web

887
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,669
attack the cyber industry

888
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,900
with any attack on a cyber

889
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,339
industry, that is why it is mostly

890
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:01,080
identifying the vulnerabilities that they

891
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,550
can see or in this case taking advantage of

892
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,980
information that is already exposed, and

893
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,230
what is done is to validate if the

894
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,910
credentials work or not or  they do not

895
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,680
work or in any case generate

896
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,300
dictionaries already because you will already have the

897
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:15,180
giuseppe the user who uses that

898
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,160
organization and a custom dictionary is generated

899
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,789


900
00:38:18,789 --> 00:38:21,189
with predictable words that can be

901
00:38:21,189 --> 00:38:22,049
used

902
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:23,650
mostly is the name of the

903
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:25,790
organization of the year

904
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:28,910
another symbol out there can  they can

905
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:32,510
access the organization within that

906
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,640
and the issue of lateral movement depends a

907
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,930
lot on the defense  s that are

908
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:38,480
applied within the organization that is to

909
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,030
say no no no you see how it looks in an

910
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:44,540
extra hakim course or where yes since

911
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,400
like this and you walk around no and do what you

912
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,650
want no no in the world really like that

913
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:50,120
in the real world  you will find

914
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,400
defenses that are not very fine-tuned and

915
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,340
defenses that do their job but the

916
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:58,910
attacker in this case, in the case of

917
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:01,700
cyber mercenaries over cyber spies, are

918
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,470


919
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:05,000
finer in carrying out their cyberattacks,

920
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,940
this does not mean that they do not make

921
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,890
noise when accessing they

922
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,289
are not invisible because  say it in some way

923
00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:16,260
so that so that no alert is raised

924
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,329
from a security alert and if

925
00:39:18,329 --> 00:39:20,039
an alert was raised, freedom is going to

926
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:22,369
be a sick character and

927
00:39:22,369 --> 00:39:25,710
informational is not the alert that

928
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:28,019
everyone ignores the shock says it is not

929
00:39:28,019 --> 00:39:29,490
informational so that I am going to review it

930
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:33,990
if you have like a thousand

931
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:36,299
informational reports during the day that is

932
00:39:36,299 --> 00:39:38,369
ignored but nevertheless the attacker without

933
00:39:38,369 --> 00:39:42,269
level attacks no no he is not going to make a

934
00:39:42,269 --> 00:39:44,430
noise they may lift you  If you get a

935
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:47,490
high or critical alert within your defense systems,

936
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:50,369
it is definitely not going to make

937
00:39:50,369 --> 00:39:51,349
this

938
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:54,359
effort to go unnoticed, there is no information that

939
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:56,010
may be stolen suddenly longer,

940
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:58,740
or it is

941
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:01,109
establishing that link with the takeover center.

942
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:03,030


943
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:06,570
Now I have the last question.  who arrives

944
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,930
in charge of the valleys they ask us the

945
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:12,870
following do you know any recent case of

946
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:15,020
social engineering such as offensive security, let's

947
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,520
see how we interpret that

948
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,640
query from Carlos do

949
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,860
you know of any recent case of

950
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,450
social engineering such as offensive security

951
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:25,329


952
00:40:25,329 --> 00:40:27,900
would yield social good

953
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,729
in social engineering attacks what they

954
00:40:30,729 --> 00:40:33,009
are  using lately they are

955
00:40:33,009 --> 00:40:35,709
valid services good of google

956
00:40:35,709 --> 00:40:38,380
valid services of the same microsoft

957
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,749
in which the signatures as they come under

958
00:40:40,749 --> 00:40:43,140
the same name of google and microsoft

959
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:46,359
pass all the defenses they do not pass all

960
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:48,549
the defenses and even the user says

961
00:40:48,549 --> 00:40:50,109
no so this month is coming a

962
00:40:50,109 --> 00:40:52,660
google file has google signature has

963
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,670
been valid  do it by google or it has been

964
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:56,109
validated by the same

965
00:40:56,109 --> 00:40:58,869
microsoft service us and what they do is that

966
00:40:58,869 --> 00:41:00,849
they click on the link and inside them there

967
00:41:00,849 --> 00:41:03,230
is the trap not

968
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:06,940
the malware that is what nowadays

969
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:10,740
the most this

970
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:13,530
as I can call it  The most creative I

971
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:15,690
have seen so far, no issues of

972
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:17,850
attacks with social engineering, that is, they

973
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,530
no longer send you the common attack

974
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:23,340
using services this is

975
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,530
the email face

976
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:28,880
and loading this file is this

977
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,520
other type of pdf file they find out,

978
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,230
that is, now they use

979
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:37,100
Google's own services  microsoft's own services

980
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,880
and they send them

981
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,849
with the malicious code as I told you that

982
00:41:42,849 --> 00:41:44,710
happens all the defense because the first

983
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,660
thing the defense system sees is signed

984
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:50,049
by google signed by microsoft and they

985
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,940
access the inbox

986
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:55,460
and there bypass and a lot of

987
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,620
actively controls the attacks are more and more

988
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,600
ingenious there are not enough

989
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,520
resources from the cloud, many of them

990
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,490
authenticated, if this I think

991
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:06,290
this challenge awaits us very i  It is important

992
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:10,550
that we are going to have to face Rafael I

993
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:12,500
thank you for your presentation it has been very

994
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,410
interesting it is treated very

995
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:17,920
interesting topics very very specific is that

996
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,570
we have to reflect a

997
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:24,860
lot and I do not know enough courage so that they

998
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,470
dismiss you from our audience

999
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:28,520
ok

1000
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,590
well this principle I want to thank

1001
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,940
All the people who are

1002
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:35,390
attending these conferences, as I say, no,

1003
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:39,300
the people who seek to

1004
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,120
satisfy their hunger, not for knowledge,

1005
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,400
are here, they are in this type of

1006
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,530
conference, they are learning something

1007
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:49,410
new and they are going to see how to apply it

1008
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:51,690
in their daily life.  The idea is to improve and

1009
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:53,700
deliver quality services because

1010
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,110
that is what we all seek to paint

1011
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:57,300
quality services and be recognized

1012
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:01,040
good by our client that

1013
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,780
