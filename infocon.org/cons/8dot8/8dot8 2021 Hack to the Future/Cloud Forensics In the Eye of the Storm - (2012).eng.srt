1
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:29,839
so

2
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:47,360
morning everybody my talk is in english 
and it speaks about cloud forensics oh why  

3
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:54,080
into the eye of the storm because cloud 
forensics now is like twister is not a cloud  

4
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:01,360
it's so difficult to make cloud 
forensics but we try to do it  

5
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:10,160
who i am i'm a computer engineer i'm 
a member of a commission i.t engineer

6
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:20,160
in a country near rome i'm a member of the 
italian information security association  

7
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:27,440
and i'm also a member of information system 
forensics association of italian chapter  

8
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:35,440
i work with law enforcement sometimes but 
also i'm a technical assessor at civil court  

9
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:45,920
and criminal court i'm a partner of the company of 
la raos company raus casa a security broker and i  

10
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:55,840
collaborate and i'm in cyber world working 
group um at the ministry of defense italian  

11
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:03,120
ministry of defense and is the height study for 
defense center of national security observatory  

12
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:14,240
the agenda we are talking about digital 
forensics to cloud where is the cloud forensics  

13
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:21,840
three dimension of cloud forensics the 
organization the technical and the legal  

14
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:31,840
the new investigative methodologies crimeware as 
a service why because we have now the dark cloud  

15
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,839
anti-forensics in the cloud 
and then the conclusion  

16
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:49,600
what is digital forensics digital forensics is 
a sign and talk with us about obtain preserve  

17
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:59,359
analyze and make a real and good documentation 
about digital evidence from electronic device  

18
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:10,160
such as tablet hard disk smartphone 
ipods and all of technical device  

19
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,960
why is important to obtain for law 
enforcement for example because to obtain  

20
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,640
the evidence is the first phase 
is from law enforcement and  

21
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:34,880
law enforcement sometimes a lot of problem 
to obtain evidence because evidence  

22
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:45,440
now digital evidence are so small think about sd 
memory the micro memory or think about the usb  

23
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:55,040
device that are so strange for example in 
the picture you can see sushi but is usb okay

24
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:07,840
and then we have a problem all around the world 
how to obtain and preserve digital evidence  

25
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:22,079
why because digital evidence and the data are 
no so strong like gods we cannot touch it we can  

26
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:34,480
um thinking about digital evidence like a 
crystal if you just put your and click or press  

27
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:46,400
button on your keyboard you can change the 
data inside okay computer forensic spaces  

28
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:54,800
evidence collection acquisition evidence 
preservation evidence analysis and and the end  

29
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:03,440
the presentation the identification collection 
acquisition there are the first phases then the  

30
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:17,040
preservation how to preserve the data sometimes 
for the not for law enforcement these faces  

31
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:26,560
is okay why because law enforcement have to do the 
identification the collection and the preservation  

32
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:35,920
we such as a technical if i collaborate with the 
law enforcement law enforcement give me an hard  

33
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:45,840
disk or a smartphone and i extract only the data 
and the main analysis and the presentation but  

34
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:55,840
if you have to make a forensics analysis with 
a for a company you have to do all these phases

35
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,719
analysis the phases of an advisor of analysis 
is important why because we have to extract  

36
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:15,039
only the data that it's significant to the 
investigation if someone told me okay extract  

37
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:25,120
everything everything but what pictures 
email logs what sometimes a lot of people  

38
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:39,599
a lot of judge told us extract everything 
but is no good you have to put the exactly  

39
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:48,719
and you have to say what you have to extract for 
the investigation the evidence presentation is the  

40
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:56,880
final phases and this is the most important why 
because the experts are capable and are be able  

41
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:06,800
to unders to explain the job and all the people 
that are not be able to understand the technical  

42
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:14,560
of computer forensics they understand with 
the final phases and with the presentation  

43
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:25,840
for example lawyers judge and other people it's 
a good practice to write down a document in which  

44
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:34,640
our world gained data and is extracted result 
are analyzed and explained step by step sometimes  

45
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:45,200
the evidence presentation contained also video 
or a for a lot of pictures of your the screenshot  

46
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:54,960
for a cloud forensics the the this phase about 
evidence presentation contains a lot of videos

47
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:08,640
this is another kind of um innovative 
investigation from csi why because the first one  

48
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:19,440
is a block was a block and this one is like a 
circle but the faces are the same identification  

49
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:26,719
collection preservation analysis and then at the 
end presentation but this is a new way and is a  

50
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:37,440
circle the digital forensics in digital forensics 
will have two different kind of analysis the phase  

51
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:46,000
of analysis is divided into data analysis and live 
analysis data analysis when we do a data analysis  

52
00:08:47,280 --> 00:09:01,199
and how did analysis we do it for example in 
our disk or in a memory in sd card or in usb  

53
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:09,200
data analysis is analysis post mortem 
is called the whole postmortem analysis  

54
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:21,920
and live analysis we do it when we find a 
computer there is switch on not switch off  

55
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:28,240
when we have a computer switch on we do 
a left analysis also for the smartphone  

56
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:35,840
for the smartphone we use a live analysis 
as usual and is also irrepeatable analysis

57
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:44,959
we did with the arrival of the cloud 
all the scenarios are changing and  

58
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:51,440
in the cloud we use sometimes only 
the live analysis but it depends  

59
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,760
we have to think about new 
tools instrument and methodology  

60
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:06,240
and the evidence collection and 
acquisition phase faces all now is changing  

61
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:14,880
where is the cloud forensics at the base we have 
network forensics digital forensics computer  

62
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:25,280
network cloud computing and but how happen into 
digital forensics from the cloud perspective  

63
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:34,960
cloud forensics now is a goal and 
it's so difficult to find the approach

64
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:44,160
we have to know to study a lot but 
you have to improve the methodology  

65
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:51,120
the same methodology that we used in the 
digital forensics and in the computer  

66
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:59,840
network forensics now we have to apply the 
same methodology but with the mind view open

67
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:10,720
we speak about now the three dimension in 
cloud forensics we have like a legal dimension  

68
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:22,080
organizational dimension and technical dimension 
why because for a cloud organization and for  

69
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:37,200
customers and for users cloud is good but we have 
a lot of mistakes and horrible things that cloud  

70
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:48,800
that in cloud we can hide in fact cloud 
is the best way to do anti-forensics

71
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:57,760
speaks about the technical dimension 
the technical dimension of the cloud is  

72
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:04,319
about forensics data collection 
elastic static and life forensics  

73
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:12,800
evidence segregation virtual environment 
investigation forensics data collection  

74
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:22,319
i speak before about the recording and now the the 
the data collection is different with the cloud  

75
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:30,160
why because we have okay we have the same 
phases of the digital forensics such as  

76
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:38,160
identification collection analysis acquisition 
but in cloud forensics we have to do  

77
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:45,839
the recording and the recording is a 
face a thesis now is an important point  

78
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:58,640
why because only one time you can make for 
example and you construct a kind of data it's a  

79
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:07,840
live analysis and how the people see your work and 
your job the work you do only with the recording

80
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:20,720
um the evidence of segregation is about cloud 
computer resource groupment yes because in in the  

81
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:28,480
cloud we have a lot of resources there are a group 
of resources the virtual environment investigation  

82
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:38,400
virtual environment is about virtualization and 
the cloud within the cloud we speaks about all  

83
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:46,000
the there's um we speak about 
the virtualized environment okay  

84
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:59,440
because we have all the machine that are 
virtualized is not easy to develop some tools  

85
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:11,280
and procedure and face light and digital forensics 
because now is change we have two different kind  

86
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:20,959
of information and we have to extract both 
parts one from client servers client side  

87
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:30,640
client side and other from internet service 
ease or cloud organization side but we know  

88
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:40,800
where is our data where is is in an island 
or in a desert or in a big data center  

89
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:48,800
in alaska we don't know we don't 
know sometimes where is data

90
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:58,880
the organizational dimension this is a 
suggestion for who for all the customer  

91
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:09,280
and for all the users that he would like 
to buy some cloud service okay i would  

92
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:19,520
like to buy some cloud service yes but i would 
like to to to see how the cloud organization

93
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:32,719
preserve my data and how is important and why 
because a cloud organization have to collaborate  

94
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,120
for at first with the law enforcement

95
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:51,520
to extract the data if some somehow happen then a 
cloud we can find this picture more expense this  

96
00:15:51,520 --> 00:16:02,000
one we have the cloud organization that speaks 
together we the customer side and provider side  

97
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:12,880
a cloud organization must be have low advisor 
et professional investigator if they need  

98
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:23,520
they had external assistance but also a team of 
incident handlers when incident happen a team  

99
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:36,240
have to fix the problem in a few hours law 
enforcement yes why a cloud organization have to  

100
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:44,800
collaborate for the evidence collection for the 
prosecution and for confiscation the data third  

101
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:56,640
the parties yes for example for odt compliance but 
also with the university the cloud organization  

102
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:05,200
now are all in development and they have to 
make a lot of research education and training

103
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:16,400
the forensics investigation as i told you 
before implied incline aiming cloud environment  

104
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:24,240
are developed in two different sites computer 
service provide and cloud customer one  

105
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:36,480
the organization must have decomposed by basic 
and must have parts which would allow a total  

106
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:43,920
efficiency when running a cloud 
forensics real collaboration  

107
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:53,040
yes we have to do a real collaboration between the 
cloud organization and all the the professional  

108
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:01,600
figure that i told you before such as 
investigator et professional incident handlers  

109
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:13,440
80 professional yt professional because there 
is a group who include them systems network and  

110
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:20,320
security administrator ethical lackers cloud the 
security architect and technical support staff  

111
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:29,280
into a cloud organization investigator is 
not to have the part of a cloud organization  

112
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,120
but also an external part of group of people 
that collaborate with the cloud organization  

113
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:49,920
and provide um to help customer side and the 
cloud organization side to help in investigation  

114
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:59,680
the incident handling why incident handling is 
very important for cloud organization because  

115
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:07,600
for example for an authorized access 
to data data leaks accident data loss  

116
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:16,720
confidentiality dilation inappropriate use 
of data system malware infection internal and  

117
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:26,960
external attack ddos attacks for all these 
incident handling team should resolve  

118
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:40,720
all this problem legal advisor legal advisor is a 
strategic point of cloud organization wow and why  

119
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:52,639
because the cloud we have different country 
we don't know where our data is and we have  

120
00:19:52,640 --> 00:20:01,600
a lot of customers and a lot of companies 
a lot of users but in each country the

121
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:09,520
law are different and with the cloud we used  

122
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:22,160
a multi-jurisdic jurisdictional okay each 
forensics activity into the cloud should not break  

123
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:33,440
punctual law in a specific jurisdiction 
internal legal consult must speak  

124
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:41,120
and have to speak and cooperate with law 
enforcement during the in the investigation

125
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,960
the external support

126
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:54,320
the external support is more important for 
the cloud organization because all the cloud  

127
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:04,639
organizations sometimes don't have skilled people 
and they need skilled people for clarifying police  

128
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:13,680
guideline and contract and in a cloud organization 
all of these things have to be transparent for  

129
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:22,800
all the customer and for all the users and for 
also law enforcement the legal dimension have to

130
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:36,960
have to do the multi-tenant architecture why 
because is the architecture in which we do find  

131
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:48,320
as many virtual box as for the customer because 
while each customer gets a separate data space

132
00:21:50,960 --> 00:22:00,640
and internal regulation and contract should be 
development in order to assure forensics activity  

133
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:12,000
no um to not break the laws of the country 
where the data are stored is it it's so  

134
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:21,600
difficult sometimes at the end this is as um 
thin lines because we don't know where the theta  

135
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:31,840
sometimes are and which country the regulation of 
the country we don't know we have to we have to um  

136
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:42,720
also but for the the the consultant side we 
have to speak about league legal for this point

137
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:55,520
from an investigative level information can be 
found and can be found where in mainframe in

138
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:07,840
pdr in a networking smartphone all of 
this device all of this device use clouds

139
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,679
server side we have server side and 
client side as i told you before  

140
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:24,240
yes the server side the for example 
the legislation in italy now

141
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:33,520
to executing data set copy from the 
esp but esp is not only internet  

142
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:41,680
service provider is also the provider from 
telecommunication service and the this article  

143
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:51,040
explained us how to have the electronic 
data fortunately we have this article in a  

144
00:23:52,720 --> 00:24:03,120
procedure panel code that explain from isp how 
to have the data yes okay we where when the  

145
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:11,600
internet service provider and internet service 
telecommunication provider are in italy we have  

146
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:26,000
this kind of law it is okay but when you have 
for example save the data block the account or  

147
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:37,520
and to block the server side account for 
example when happen an incident we can do this  

148
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:49,600
we can block and cloud or an account cloud 
sometimes because it depends of the law where the  

149
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:59,919
data center is client side from the client side we 
have to make live analysis if we have credential  

150
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:16,240
but when we are lucky sometimes we have to find 
and we found the cl the credential of cloud  

151
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:27,360
for example dropbox or a cloud or amazon sometimes 
with a dump of memory with the live forensics  

152
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:36,320
we find the credential and the configuration 
templates are saved in clear text or in the cache  

153
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:48,879
or for example into local backup and it's clear 
the data transit it's difficult to make effort  

154
00:25:50,080 --> 00:26:01,280
of this part why because sometimes when a crime is 
done it's too late to run this kind of operation  

155
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:10,000
and it's impossible to establish 
a network forensics because in  

156
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:18,320
this case data transit is a network forensics as 
i told you before the cloud forensics is a mix  

157
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:26,240
of all of single parts of forensics 
digital forensics nature forensics  

158
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:35,760
is a mix a big mix and for example in this part 
we have the data transit and it's a network  

159
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:45,840
forensics but network forensics when we capture 
the data in transit sometimes it's too late  

160
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:57,200
remote acquisition it depends because sometimes 
we are not be able to make remote acquisition  

161
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:07,360
for example because why about the integrity 
and the checksum the hash of the file  

162
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:20,720
for example amazon has got for all the files 
ash for those data uploaded into as a metadata

163
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:28,560
and then the the methodology 
about what about different isp

164
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:38,080
as i told you before network analysis log 
analysis make screenshot and reporting  

165
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:46,720
network analysis the network analysis 
is about acquiring an acquisition  

166
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:57,760
in about the network traffic of the worst station 
when is applicable and in digital forensor  

167
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:10,160
um also in digital forensic mobile forensics 
you have to do the ash printing why because the  

168
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:20,400
the hash printing must be done to acquire all 
the file for example when we didn't do for  

169
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:28,399
one time law enforcement didn't do 
the the ash printing for hard disk  

170
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:36,320
and their disk without enough printing 
is not valid it's not an evidence  

171
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:45,120
okay the ash printing is the only 
way to the to say in this moment  

172
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:57,600
these artists have this situation and then i copy 
and i do the forensics copy of their disk with the  

173
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:07,120
ash printing without the ash printing the copy is 
not confirmed is no for example a forensic copy  

174
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:16,480
log analysis acquiring and examining log file 
from firewall antivirus application program  

175
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,920
possible catch and tempering 
director file from client  

176
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:35,360
screenshot yes why i told you before you have to 
recording make screenshot yes because this is the  

177
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:42,479
only way in a cloud forensic because it's live 
analysis it's not a data analysis or post-mortem  

178
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:54,160
analysis is live analysis uh we have to do all the 
the picture video to show to other to judge and to  

179
00:29:54,160 --> 00:30:02,080
other technical consultants desktop screenshot 
possible screenshot of running programs  

180
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:15,520
reading out and commenting and commenting in live 
mode sometimes it should be like um you i smile  

181
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:21,920
when i think about okay i'm front of my computer 
i made a live forensics and i have to talk with my  

182
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:29,280
computer alone okay i have to do this because 
it's important okay i click this button okay  

183
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:43,840
i click this or i write on keyboard this 
command it's important to comment how you do in  

184
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:55,760
on that computer or other kind or a server 
what you do in specific moment reporting the  

185
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:04,480
reporting is the last phase and all the single 
activity must be reporter in the clearest way

186
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:18,160
and in the cloud forensics now the 
reporting is more more with more details the  

187
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:27,200
yes but at least a final reporting is 
mandatory in order to supply the validity  

188
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:38,800
and allow to legal the expert to 
fit it it into the correct scenario  

189
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:54,560
okay but we don't have the creden the credential 
access access okay this is a small cloud service  

190
00:31:54,560 --> 00:32:06,080
pro service provider for example google gmail 
is in the cloud or april april have an icloud  

191
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:15,199
specific environment and oh amazon we spoke 
about amazon yesterday with marco for example  

192
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:24,640
icloud and access credential dropbox and 
the cloud are the most famous at the moment

193
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:38,000
can dropbox accessed via web okay but if we don't 
have the credential and icloud we can share in the  

194
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:49,280
cloud a lot of files and folders that are stored 
in different areas in different kind of device  

195
00:32:50,000 --> 00:33:01,040
because it's laptop it's also smartphone now 
i put on this slide at the end some links  

196
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:12,320
about dropbox forensics because with dropbox 
dropbox there is specific kind of operation  

197
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:23,840
that you can do to extract the data from dropbox 
for example also you can extract the deleted file

198
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:36,960
with a cloud icloud contain and save information 
about the user and contain all apple's device  

199
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:45,760
for example iphone ipad etc etc what is the 
important of icloud at the moment is important  

200
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:55,760
because when i made a backup of for example 
my iphone and i have the backup on my computer  

201
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:07,200
and the backup is encrypted okay if 
i put the backup on a cloud my friend  

202
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:14,720
discover that the backup in a cloud is 
not encrypted if you have the credential  

203
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:27,520
access for access to a icloud is good in a 
forensic analysis because sometimes we don't need  

204
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:34,320
we don't need for example the smartphone 
because the smartphone was broke or other  

205
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:50,640
but if the people have put on his backup on icloud 
i can discover that backup and without encryption  

206
00:34:52,080 --> 00:35:03,600
the dark cloud why cloud is so dark also why 
because it's a new battlefield of cybercrime  

207
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:16,160
yes cpu power to be used for distributed 
cracking target acting acting attacks via  

208
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:27,040
advanced persistent treats sphere fishing 
walling or web application hacking for example  

209
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:38,080
amazon google and a lot of things to do 
cyber crime with the cloud now you can find  

210
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:48,640
in this time ddos attack yes running on a 
cloud can be extremely helpful ddos attacker  

211
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:58,000
because as much easy to mitigate within your 
standard infrastructure from an attacker  

212
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,640
point of view the cloud infrastructure 
will represent a very powerful shotgun  

213
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:17,759
yes but we don't have only ddos attacks we have 
and here you can find all the cloud ddos victim

214
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,759
from the client committing 
transaction on cloud-based service  

215
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:32,080
computing cloud back-end database unavailable 
to cloud-based server because was attacked  

216
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:39,840
perimeter connection satellite accessed 
to and control the cloud resource

217
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:55,120
password cracking we have the link all the cloud 
need to make password cracking attackers or radio  

218
00:36:55,120 --> 00:37:07,839
boost about cloud esp resource in order to run 
password tracking software on cloud machine and  

219
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:16,400
for example root as be able to 
crack a lot of password per second  

220
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:28,560
and for example apparent the mistranslation by 
a german newspaper of english speaking reports  

221
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:37,200
on research amazon base the password cracking 
tool let to raid the frozen bank account  

222
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:47,040
and for example in january 2011 researcher 
crack wi-fi password with amazon cloud  

223
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:57,040
computers available for what for when 28 cent 
per minute and the cost of the crack came just  

224
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:10,960
one dot 68 dollars and it's not too much it's 
so cheap this is another another cloud cracker  

225
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:26,480
and you can find here the link and it's public and 
with the the cloud we cloud now is the best way  

226
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:37,200
to do anti-forensics why because we have to lose 
data control no access to physical infrastructure  

227
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:44,799
and to extract the data the data is 
sometimes so difficult we have to think  

228
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:55,520
other kind of choose to extract the data 
and legal issues of multi-jurisdiction  

229
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:06,160
multi-tenancy and multi-ownership lack of tool for 
large-scale distributing and virtualization system  

230
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:17,840
we have no standard interface no provider 
cooperation because i told you about the cloud  

231
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:28,240
organization should be do and should behave 
all that kind of internal group of people  

232
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:35,200
then and then they cooperate together with 
external for example law enforcement and other  

233
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:45,919
and university also but for the moment the 
provider no no cooperation the difficulties  

234
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:55,840
in producing forensically sound and admissible 
evidence in the court we have this problem

235
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,520
and all of those techniques  

236
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:11,680
tips and methodology that may be able to slow 
down and stop the finding for digital evidence  

237
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:26,880
is anti-forensics why because all of the all crime 
can be hidden for cloud cloud impact is by default  

238
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:39,520
an anti-forensics methodology and at least it give 
us two times conclusion the conclusions are about  

239
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:51,600
and you have to think that each scenarios are 
different environment for example if you have  

240
00:40:51,600 --> 00:41:01,600
a situation with amazon amazon is different from 
dropbox cloud is different from a cloud okay we  

241
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:09,040
have different situation and different approach 
but the only approach that you should be have  

242
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:19,520
is the approach of the digital forensic okay 
and the investigator with law enforcement  

243
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:29,680
and the consultant now are called for new 
challenge and developed this new approach without  

244
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:39,359
becoming a last minute digital forensics expert 
yes because why i wrote this because for example  

245
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:47,760
in italy a lot of people they don't do nothing 
about information technology they do okay i am a  

246
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:57,680
digital forensics expert but no no because i made 
for example a lot of study i study for a computer  

247
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:06,799
engineering degree then a master in a digital 
forensics and every day now i improve my myself  

248
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:18,400
and the the the best background for a digital 
forensic should be computer study and should be  

249
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:32,720
with the open mind this is interesting links the 
some tools some tools that are um in development  

250
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:42,319
for example on money at forensics.com 
you can find a for gmail yahoo and for  

251
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:52,960
april icloud you can find some interesting 
thing but is different they make a division  

252
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:59,840
for law enforcement for consultant and for the 
organization how to extract the data in cloud  

253
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:10,720
then other tools is about dropbox other paper 
an interesting paper about drop forensics also  

254
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:20,799
this one about dropbox the and these two about 
sans uh recovering digital evidence in a com  

255
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:27,200
cloud computing paradigm and exfiltration 
forensics in the age of cloud

256
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:39,840
then thank you for your attention 
if you have some question tell me

257
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,840
it's possible switch off the light

258
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,840
okay

259
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,840
m

260
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:49,840
from the cloud my experience is about cloud 
icloud apple icloud dropbox and amazon

261
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:07,280
oh the reception of the the dude the daughter 
how do you how he think and resect this data

262
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:22,880
okay the situation in italy now in is 
more difficult why because a lot of judges  

263
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:30,800
don't know nothing about digital forensics 
and digital evidence and they start to improve  

264
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:38,319
their skill at the moment in fact 
when it speaks about the documentation  

265
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:48,640
you have to document the uh you have to do the 
great things of documentation and to make video  

266
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:57,120
and to do picture because a lot of judge 
don't understand now for example also the  

267
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:13,839
computer forensics now he starts to enter in the 
opting of ash but is difficult is a challenge

268
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,840
foreign

269
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:43,279
foreign cloud forensics

270
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:57,200
yes i put on this presentation some tools but 
this this tool are every day in development  

271
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:08,880
okay because okay for the computer forensics 
we have no tool for example ftk nks and this is  

272
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:23,840
closed but also open open source tool okay cloud 
forensics is new and they for example do the best  

273
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:32,960
for extract the data for uh from the cloud but 
it's not like for example the computer forensics  

274
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:44,800
in america was about 20 years okay ago they start 
to make computer forensics with cloud we start now  

275
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:54,640
and with the computer forensics we have a lot of 
tools the and they are fixed and we can use the  

276
00:47:54,640 --> 00:48:02,960
all the procedure and for example to using case 
you have to not to study no you have to click  

277
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:10,640
one button and you extract the data and in case 
make the analysis for you okay in case i would  

278
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:19,040
like to extract features or word document or pdf 
and in case made all of this for you but this is  

279
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:28,880
not the approach of digital forensics because i 
usually use a lot of tools not only one because i  

280
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:38,000
would like to test also the open source tools and 
sometimes you can only use the open source tool  

281
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:49,759
not the ftk or in case it depends because in the 
digital forensics world the situation is different  

282
00:48:49,760 --> 00:49:00,240
in each case each case is different you could find 
two cases that are similar but it's impossible  

283
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:11,600
because okay one extra some data another extract 
only the pdf another only the video but it depends  

284
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:19,279
and when we find an rdx and our disk with 
the full disk encryption this is another  

285
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:28,800
challenge and for example with one tool you can 
able to extract the passport the password but  

286
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:43,840
on if you have another operating system you 
shouldn't extract the data okay and it depends

287
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:58,960
hello what is your experience 
with law enforcement in a  

288
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:07,200
european union in the euro in the european 
union yes or in the european union  

289
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:14,720
i worked with all the italian law enforcement 
but do you have experience working with  

290
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:25,760
un by example u.n united nation with the united 
nations no no no with the united nation now

291
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:38,320
is that an issue for the computer forensics for 
the cloud for you you can only work in italy no  

292
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:51,040
no no no for example a lot of requests every day 
i had from japan from china and from other country  

293
00:50:51,840 --> 00:51:01,600
and for example this morning i received an email 
from incident response hitachi team because  

294
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:14,240
they have a problem with an ap address and 
the japan court says okay the only ep address  

295
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:24,240
it's an evidence for us no because in italy 
for example fortunately two years ago i made  

296
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:37,040
my documentation and my investigation now and 
the judge after my work says okay the ep is  

297
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:46,400
not possible is an evidence is a way to arrive 
at the evidence but it's not an evidence okay
