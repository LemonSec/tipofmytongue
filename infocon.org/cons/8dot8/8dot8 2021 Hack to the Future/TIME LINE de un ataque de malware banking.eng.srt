00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,140
] Good afternoon everyone, it is a pleasure

8
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,420
for me to be present at this edition

9
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,190
of the 8.8 event.

10
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,190
I come to Ecuador. I am a

11
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,570
systems engineer specialized in forensic computation

12
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,600
after  say security I have another

13
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,090
profession and angled had a part of the

14
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,759
credit as well that some colleague

15
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,909
handles some certifications and management

16
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:21,740
is a combination of a

17
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,548
forensic computer network

18
00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:28,399
to focus where we left it in that

19
00:01:28,399 --> 00:01:31,680
type of network

20
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,330
and your summer under this light is to

21
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,700
follow him  And think between changing news

22
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,040
and news regarding the forensic field,

23
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,680
my emails for any

24
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,630
situation later will have them already

25
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,500
positive and in the end that of the

26
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,890
presentation

27
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,619
I am going to deal with today is a

28
00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:01,950
forensic issue in another facet than the previous

29
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,079
companion process  el amigo del coco his

30
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:08,860
themes can be the initial part

31
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,410
my theme to focus the part after

32
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,690
security incidents in which they are

33
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,480
reflected  procedures and techniques of

34
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,790
forensic investigation in order to

35
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,550
find allies that allow us to know

36
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,290
what happened to those who intervene

37
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,990
many the legal part if it is necessary to take

38
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,930
into account if you want to take it to

39
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,330
the judicial or later part once

40
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,240
it has been delivered  that

41
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,670
the shots are found is because the

42
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,910
main part of this talk is to manage a

43
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,010
vision of how the university

44
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,860
the forensic investigator acts on his

45
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,660
mentor is that I wanted to investigate

46
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,840
an attack by Marc Guasch, not a

47
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,239
banking institution, in this case we will

48
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,190
focus on putting together a timeline  a

49
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,860
timeline

50
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,460
this step is one of more investigations

51
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,460
two days of investigation time are handled

52
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,590


53
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,930
later detailing

54
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,939
and we try to answer the questions

55
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,769
that are commonly handled at the

56
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:12,720
investigation level

57
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,930
how it happened

58
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:18,640
when how where and why

59
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,710
this part we do it now  whose

60
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,140
investigation and we always in the

61
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,970
wasted part the poor

62
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,360
security

63
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,520
We investigate our neighborhood neighbor

64
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,810
who are the attackers of the neighborhood residents

65
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,010
because we have many

66
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,190
similarities in our knowledge

67
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,440
that the other researchers like,

68
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,320
the typical ones of whether the

69
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,180
curious or the Gijonese

70
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,120
of that person are

71
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,019
an attacker in this case, how are they how

72
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:56,870
they act that what they do as they proceed

73
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,299
randomly in three income of the sites if

74
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:01,880
they do not know how they dress

75
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,170
some use their hat

76
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:09,920
very well because others use this

77
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,970
gray hat

78
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,680
others use their white hat

79
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,920
others

80
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,019
today we create a black that is too

81
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:23,890
big in our  diversity gentlemen

82
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:28,330
others on the other hand using a hat

83
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,970
on the other hand they do not know how to use the

84
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,090
hat

85
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:36,110
and still want to ride a horse

86
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,070
history

87
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,680
without knowing how to use a hat correctly

88
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,710
all the characteristics of the types

89
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,750
of attackers that we have the part in the

90
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,290
digital part

91
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,820
in the financial type  When we find

92
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:56,010
attacks of this type, that 4% is focused

93
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,930
on the use of the ma  nual malware

94
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,440
rankings and this is because the

95
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,320
economic returns are much more subtitles than

96
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,470
any other type of attack using

97
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,689
other types of technical goods

98
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:14,809
the trojan horse is already short there

99
00:05:14,809 --> 00:05:18,110
will be no subscription terminals

100
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:22,010
forgive the malware handle malware assets

101
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:25,550
one by the by  way of eating with

102
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,720
some of the attackers

103
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:31,009
we are going to analyze a

104
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:33,740
research case and he is going to use these phases

105
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,069
in Felix's hands, investigating a little and

106
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:39,680
knowing what happened, how

107
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,309
the lessons were given, activities and based

108
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:45,110
the school activity, we found that

109
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,990
We will go on to recreate the sequel of

110
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,210
events that we have in the fields in

111
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,139
utilitarian fields of investigation,

112
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:57,460
as all churches offer, we begin with

113
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,039
a first phase that is to

114
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:02,439
inform ourselves what happened at the

115
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:06,090
time of what happened

116
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,780
always security in which it is a

117
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,540
bank aunt  has 800 thousand dollars at the

118
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,670
good time for several transactions

119
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:17,290
that were

120
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,069
made which has been transferred to accounts

121
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:27,620
banking more than 700 thousand dollars that have

122
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,240
been withdrawn the

123
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,520
audit officials have been the different

124
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,270
accounts that is money in the same way

125
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,880
as the same being separated from the job

126
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,330


127
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,310
once the financial entity

128
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,919
detects the loss of two thousand

129
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:48,530
dollars not

130
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,300
in  The two that manage both of their

131
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,820
transfer systems detect

132
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,530
which users from which users were

133
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,210
carried out

134
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,050
this equipment was isolated from users, it was

135
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,240
intervened or separated until

136
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,150
the investigation of the case begins and here

137
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,010
we have the identification of the case the

138
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,410
identification of the case was  part of

139
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:13,500
forensic investigation we detail everything

140
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,690
we need to know to

141
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,100
start the investigation

142
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,860
here they let us know that all this type

143
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,660
of transfer took place on April 10,

144
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,730
2015, which was the year we

145
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:27,140
were in progress from 4:00 p.m.

146
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,480
to 7:00 p.m.  hours with being a minute

147
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:35,030
were those three hours in which

148
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,040
different

149
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,550
to different types of

150
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,900
normal accounts  badly from the part where I come from

151
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,249
which is Ecuador and

152
00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:48,749
nearby countries and many banking entities still do not

153
00:07:48,749 --> 00:07:52,979
have a zero part of this type

154
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:54,739
of technology, researchers

155
00:07:54,739 --> 00:07:57,959
prepared for that simply because

156
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:00,359
the insurance companies are in charge of putting the

157
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:03,089
money currently in the insurance that they

158
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:04,979
require  The rest is much more

159
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:08,609
detailed to be able to determine the

160
00:08:08,609 --> 00:08:10,289
amount that they are going to return because it

161
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:11,789
will depend on whether the user had

162
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:14,459
participation or the type of people it is,

163
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:17,189
it is not that they participated although any that

164
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:19,880
this type of task

165
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,280
initially we have everything that they are  the

166
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,170
transfers when some of those

167
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:28,680
that occurred on the date

168
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,560
of April 10 that we saw, we are going to work a

169
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:37,070
lot for the dates because the time

170
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:42,500
we still have here which were

171
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,370
English sent funds to the accounts and

172
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,690
the two authorization networks

173
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,980
with this initial training  we started to

174
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,830
create our research service

175
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:58,610
and to be able to say

176
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,350
and we have generated a timeline

177
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,860
previous

178
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,510
in real time and we made all the

179
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:14,810
general indications, we have a date that

180
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:18,170
is April 10, which was the day of

181
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:21,980
the transfers and different times

182
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,050
that were those that each

183
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,980
of the financial movements were made

184
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,860
with this information prior to the team

185
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,780
that  They isolated, we generate an image,

186
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,300
so normally

187
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,220
we generate it with more than a forensic provider with chain of custody fibers,

188
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,550
it is always a procedure that

189
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:42,240
every entity must have in order to

190
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,580
alter and above all the reliability of

191
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,860
the data that is there and to

192
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,990
be able to make them sound without any chance  The

193
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,270
evidences go to the legal part in the

194
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,990
later ones

195
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:56,010
the water of more force

196
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,750
once we have the image is by

197
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,550
inheritance of we verify the scene and

198
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,250
we prepare to resolve to implement everything

199
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,810
we normally feel we take to

200
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:07,130
do an analysis of this type to

201
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,290
know the  scenario we want that we

202
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,850
use it and so that we are going to

203
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,790
deliver it we prepare a lot of coffee is a

204
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,529
project that will take us a lot  time

205
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:19,589
as well as the attackers take a

206
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:21,470
long time to carry out their investigative activities,

207
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:24,209
equally the forms the

208
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:25,920
same time much more of being able to

209
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,620
find or give rise to doubt and

210
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,350
allow us to appear the case in the museums

211
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,670


212
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:37,010
and we started the forensic analysis

213
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,470
and the initial environment was  a

214
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,649


215
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:43,959
windows operating system windows xp operating systems are cared for

216
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:47,960
within a financial institution

217
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,000
when these types of scenarios intervene

218
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,490


219
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:55,589
in windows and they are victims of the

220
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:58,779
actions and we focus on the

221
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:01,290
analysis of

222
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:05,160
certain information systems step I

223
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,990
create interviews recreate all the events

224
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:10,110
that  They have come to know what we can

225
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,880
get and population to be the

226
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,250
activity that I think happened on that

227
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,440
computer then from where you produce

228
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,540
the financial actions

229
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,080
initially this download of the file of

230
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,000
internalizing this file that has all

231
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,460
the activities of the users

232
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,160
each user has  that file inside

233
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,320
your portfolio is what allows us to ge  Nerar

234
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,180
in the repudios within the activity

235
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,030
of users a computer team can

236
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:39,150
have 10 users for each one it will have its

237
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,590
own writing but it will allow to

238
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,990
identify and separate what was

239
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,780
what each one of these did and how we are going to

240
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,779
collaborate

241
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:49,519
we analyzed opening the

242
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,920
security events is  It is important to know that

243
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,899
all the activities that are operating viruses are selected here, it

244
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:57,040


245
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,199
is important to perform

246
00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:01,899
indexed searches with keywords, it is very

247
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:04,240
important to carry out at the same time because it is

248
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,949
another procedure that we do within

249
00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:07,959
forensic investigations, whether they are

250
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:10,149
initial penn

251
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:12,430
or putting an incident of  this

252
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,059
type of security

253
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:17,279
and a browsing and internet file

254
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,999
that is also important to investigate

255
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:23,879
is not a source of the cookies that we have

256
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:25,349
from the equipment is a very

257
00:12:25,349 --> 00:12:28,079
important factor for an analysis of this

258
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,639
type of attack such as an

259
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:31,219
external attack on financial institutions

260
00:12:31,219 --> 00:12:34,859
where  it was possible to enter a virus because

261
00:12:34,859 --> 00:12:37,049
by all the sources by which

262
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:39,359
They entered this type of

263
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,929
activity,

264
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,420
we have the casinos inside the

265
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,240
windows folder, so the

266
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,370
happiness movement in that type of magician is 32

267
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,990
remaining,

268
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,560
among other beers, we have been looking

269
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,350
well, it is because we started the nobody that is

270
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,870
why a forensic image is a

271
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,450
device  that allows us to create an

272
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,700
image can be to paralyze the

273
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,770
research process the objective of creating an

274
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:12,320
identical copy of a hard disk is to be able to

275
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,300
help the original so that we can give

276
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,240
errands and be able to work a copy the

277
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,980
copy can we can make the

278
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,290
changes that are necessary to  to be able to

279
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:23,779
find any type from there

280
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:25,839
once we have our own because

281
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,520
we will begin to work within the

282
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,990
investigation

283
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,279
well

284
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,149
let's see that the first source of

285
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:38,610
evidence that interested us is external that

286
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,189
we have it within the

287
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:43,410
user folder of each of the users

288
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,949
because it is important  this file because it

289
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:50,309
is the user activity log file

290
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:51,959


291
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:54,420
and it is imp  ortante we

292
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,149
already detected the name of the user in which

293
00:13:57,149 --> 00:14:00,839
the transfer is seen if you want to be able to

294
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,709
analyze and see what activities it has in

295
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:07,259
that part for that we export we export

296
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:13,649
this file using the images and

297
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:17,189
we give it with puppets, import it and we

298
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,439
can open it with other  With other types of

299
00:14:19,439 --> 00:14:20,970
tools such

300
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:24,259
as wing 2003 it

301
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:26,089
is a tool that uses to open

302
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:28,999
this file in this install and

303
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:31,689
allows us to see many

304
00:14:31,689 --> 00:14:34,879
important activities of what the user can

305
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:35,509
have

306
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:37,910
among some of those when he said we saw

307
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,499
this user we export

308
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:44,299
with this tool known as the

309
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:46,919
windows 7 recovery

310
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,259
we have a tab to be your accesses

311
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:51,779
and what are the applications that start

312
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:54,689
when windows starts when the user

313
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:57,749
is logged in other users

314
00:14:57,749 --> 00:14:59,519
but three users that I have, imagine being

315
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,369
able to enter the machine and this

316
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:03,839
application is not going to be run when the

317
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,909
teacher is  installed inside the

318
00:15:05,909 --> 00:15:07,829
user so he wants as the code

319
00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:09,560
2500

320
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,600
will totally start when  ndo these

321
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,270
angels in session

322
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,630
and then we have the initial applications

323
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,400


324
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,100
in another when one starts

325
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,149
it is in a process of the

326
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:27,720
right cb that is a normal process of

327
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,670
windows it is used to call some

328
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,009
services but seeing that it continues

329
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:34,740
reforming difficulty we

330
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:40,610
realize that already  not to a 32-point file,

331
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,850
that is, finding, it can be said that

332
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:48,200
in this case we find every

333
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,110
file the point of bs

334
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,300
we see that it is a point file from the

335
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,519
32-point file bbc they are found in the entire

336
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:58,660
windows

337
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,750
folder.  To see

338
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,459
physically or logically where

339
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:06,459
this is hosted, what else can be

340
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:10,739
entered easily? It says in this file

341
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,990
well within the windows registry

342
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,320
we can see the following note we do not

343
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,930
enter the folder with the options

344
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:22,120
to find in windows and we can come

345
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,770
and continue  the following routes

346
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,730
finding misinformation of the

347
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,220
applications that start when we saw

348
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:36,019
when his excessive nephew

349
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:39,270
well  out of all the folders r.unido

350
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:42,240
we find countless

351
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,390
files that in magazines are doubtful we are struck by

352
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:47,910
the professor files

353
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,670
on names suits point plus a point

354
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:55,610
bar says let time continue to

355
00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:00,150
dance to you and what includes a valera

356
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:03,180
look is a  In a synthetic way that is

357
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,879
doing many activities, especially

358
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:12,809
these people have done,

359
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,900
but we bank officials know

360
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,089
because they invest in a god of dollars for

361
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:21,089
three months for their security is the one

362
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:23,339
after they are violated and they

363
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:27,920
are almost always focused on this type of

364
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,090
finding a way because

365
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:34,600
to  Wherever they can today, they are with this other

366
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:40,600
past, this other of 22 million, in the

367
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,610
end, they were achieved for 4 million

368
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:46,900
dollars, they did not take out to an

369
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,789
Ecuadorian municipality with the millions of dollars in

370
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:50,200
one day

371
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:57,029
they took out powerful weapons they

372
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:02,469
left us losses in the street

373
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:10,500
because right point  that point

374
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:25,050
we are to analyze our

375
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,929
and knew search

376
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:30,160
a virus

377
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,770
was a water what had been

378
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,410
installed of the equipment

379
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,450
is another  at the same time the difference between a

380
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,920
judicial expert opinion

381
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:49,740
if there is evidence expressed that one of

382
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,220
the parties says and we put it

383
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,309
here we started from scratch they simply

384
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:58,500
thought that the only

385
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,740
initial information was that the user that they are from

386
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,360
this machine making the transfers

387
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,809
but as when it happened how they are  and

388
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:10,470
because they did not know the importance of the

389
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,299
answer in this case also because

390
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:15,179
after a few days the investigation was done

391
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:17,130
but it was possible to determine

392
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:21,110
many many things

393
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,330
well let's see some files found

394
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,920
in this folder be

395
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,190
glad to have the point of times

396
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:35,040
the native point point  of bs they are not

397
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,700
files

398
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:41,360
of not drinking and writing they are written they are

399
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,750
programs based on visuals and it is a

400
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,400
totally Windows file uses it

401
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,490
to enjoy certain tasks and

402
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,470
attackers take advantage of to

403
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,910
camouflage them

404
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:57,900
in this type of language because they

405
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,430
do not have the same application  to

406
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,820
say that twice is an application

407
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,800
that runs that type of files will be

408
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,020
axis  cutad because the

409
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,130
contractive of the visualize them

410
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:17,020
because they give us dividends etc

411
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,669
because many of those times that if they are

412
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:22,100
detected by an antivirus but they do

413
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:26,680
a previous analysis of the banking system

414
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,700
if the banking system has a 1

415
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:34,350
an antivirus of x if you know the spirit

416
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,200
of  total elvis

417
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,940
have crossed over to enjoy

418
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:46,080
dotcom dot com is a website where I

419
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,830
upload a file and it tells me that it

420
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:52,669
needs individuals, no

421
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,130
and that is a tool for

422
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,900
both security and

423
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,200
criminals because they want to

424
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,330
attack a company  that the antivirus

425
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:08,840
has where it has sometimes worked

426
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,860
in another way and it has been verified, it is detected

427
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,870
, the recipe has not been guaranteed, it does not

428
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:19,649
detect it perfect red little for the

429
00:21:19,649 --> 00:21:21,090
attack,

430
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:24,000
in this way, this

431
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,610
type of security and other causes

432
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,999
for which the

433
00:21:28,999 --> 00:21:33,889
banking entities begin to violate  Ecuador have suffered this

434
00:21:33,889 --> 00:21:35,850
type of attack

435
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:38,360
and

436
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,470
the details of saying poor of that level

437
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:47,309
some statistics of a website

438
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:50,789
due we see that in the ecu  The

439
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:53,230
example of which I am taking

440
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:56,650
is 7 percent of attacks of this

441
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,350
type or it contains 7 percent of attacks

442
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:02,040
of type bs and if I have a relationship

443
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,380
with many other countries it is one of the

444
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,320
largest we do not have that Peru does not exceed

445
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,790
Mexico  it does not exceed but at the population level they

446
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:12,250
are three or four times

447
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,500
as large

448
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,360
we have that when it is much more than

449
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:21,270
egypt india colombia bolivia guatemala

450
00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:24,820
then right now they have found there

451
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,809
for their meditations

452
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:32,150
in this area in that kind of details

453
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,380
well i

454
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:41,630
think they make 32 assets quickly

455
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,100
It is a general way not to go into

456
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,690
script details and we see that in

457
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:50,120
general the execution of a

458
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,610
two-point process

459
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,620
we see that the

460
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:58,340
windows folder enters the folder you call the

461
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,659
point s rights files

462
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:06,049
and this file is executed in a hidden way

463
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,770
It is found in all the

464
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:12,179
folders that we saw in the first image

465
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:14,100
to know that what it does is file

466
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,600
has three children with it is the quadrant

467
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,009
of the windows product of

468
00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:22,769
final borders with him at the end to know

469
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:25,440
what you have interactive, we can see it

470
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,470
from some free tools,

471
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:31,830
others for payment, in the machine we

472
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:37,200
do not have free web applications and

473
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,820
we decided that what one of these does within the

474
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,000
system

475
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,020
is all health and is more

476
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:49,260
good is what. is

477
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:53,370
this site is a point file

478
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:57,480
that website wants to generate a sport

479
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,600
in a sport in which it will be

480
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,490
presented in html css format but

481
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:07,590
all the activities or all

482
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,240
the changes that the file generates in  the

483
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,700
windows registry

484
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,309
which assets have

485
00:24:14,309 --> 00:24:16,529
file activities exploitation the process are

486
00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:18,779
activated when this file is executed

487
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:21,230
on the machine

488
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:25,309
and thus we have a file point after

489
00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:27,559
point pk

490
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:29,929
results of this analysis deactivated

491
00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:32,899
point is when we have an active point

492
00:24:32,899 --> 00:24:35,929
of sin which has left  from analyzing

493
00:24:35,929 --> 00:24:36,830
the network traffic

494
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:39,950
we know that there is a connection not or

495
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,830
that it is a file generates a collection

496
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:45,409
where in the report the

497
00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:48,039
network activity and analyzes  When the file is pasted

498
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:50,779
we see that it connects to an

499
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:53,240
IP address that the function of asset

500
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,419
point

501
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,110
271

502
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,790
is the function of the file

503
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:04,390
is that they give it an external cure that

504
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:06,559
was not detected

505
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:11,840
or to the state where it went to the state

506
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,789
by the entities systems

00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,370
that is the first part of buildings is

00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:20,350
what we receive the first first

510
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,650
view

511
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:25,890
in the first instance now let's start with an

512
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:28,980
investigation to find out what the

513
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:32,040
deterioration is like because they are there because it is

514
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,700
not your turn to start an

515
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,430
investigation yet,

516
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:40,190
having to do so on the afternoon of the 10th.

517
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:46,360
April 2000 of this year the recent attack

518
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,809
I am not doing a line of work

519
00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:52,400
of alestis show work

520
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,130
so we decided it was decided to generate

521
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:57,710
a window of time that is to say a

522
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:01,090
border a kind of sean and others

523
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:04,440
we did a search for files with 30 days

524
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,360
before and five  days after the date

525
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,350
on which the activities took place

526
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,799
to know that what we found

527
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,530
we lengthened the search and won the

528
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:20,490
window  45 days 60 days back and

529
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,590
later and deer cases but

530
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:26,039
we started to generate searches by opening

531
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:27,809
the time windows it is important

532
00:26:27,809 --> 00:26:29,810
for a researcher to

533
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:32,540
generate the time entries because the

534
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:40,400
2015 university is an infinity of

535
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,280
information, something that to be able to analyze

536
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,290
and that is not  It is very feasible it will take a

537
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:47,360
long time but I am going to reduce to a

538
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,850
window that already with film analysis

539
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,660
we

540
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,670
can eternity we can work the most

541
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:57,930
correct programming we analyze this type

542
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:01,110
of search and we find ourselves, for

543
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,900
example, if the afternoon is April 10 on

544
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,540
26  From April

545
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,950
we found that a dll file was executed,

546
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:11,700
the point of bs another type of

547
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,040
scripting applications because I had the

548
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,610
machine I think that if the script and

549
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:22,290
from April 26 to March 26 it will have another

550
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:25,290
connection or it called a connection in this

551
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:27,549
case

552
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:32,139
to  the 199 116 60 points 16 and even

553
00:27:32,139 --> 00:27:34,900
but what are

554
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,620
the ports to scan

555
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,700
the 1 maroto valley

556
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:43,389
until you can scale until you can

557
00:27:43,389 --> 00:27:46,620
establish the condition

558
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:50,000
But for the questions to

559
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,760
appear, they will find, you can do

560
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,559
another search with a keyword that

561
00:27:55,559 --> 00:28:01,820
would not be a deceased at the point of bs

562
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:05,390
when we executed in this file we

563
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:07,100
got a lot of information from the chrome browser, we

564
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,520


565
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,260
exported the chrome logs, we opened

566
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,190
with a program

567
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:18,070
that we  attend the pre-salt made

568
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:22,060
the website 2.0 for young

569
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,929
insecurities

570
00:28:23,929 --> 00:28:28,970
we can see that it is used for 33

571
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:34,330
the thumb after the city and he

572
00:28:35,769 --> 00:28:37,100
i

573
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:40,480
but a download from

574
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,530
and the ip address

575
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:48,680
then the acid lll 33 points of times

576
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,250
what it did is download these  three

577
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:56,200
those three initial elements

578
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,530
at the time that April 26 was the

579
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:04,559
date most back against,

580
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:07,669
well what does each of these three

581
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:09,789
files do,

582
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,370
we see that the file

583
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:16,409
on 6.3

584
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,419
executes the

585
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:26,850
inside of the windows enclosure the

586
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:29,340
pérez file point of which is  They like that

587
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,739
file point that what it does is add

588
00:29:31,739 --> 00:29:35,520
certain values to the windows style

589
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,550
and analyzing active profile point 6 we

590
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:41,760
realize what it does is  Within a

591
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,760
month I write at the beginning it was

592
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,710
the one of the 32 does not load the service it was left

593
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:51,180
I can congress to decimal Cáceres

594
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:56,360
files of that part we detect that

595
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,760
from that aggression ips download the

596
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:03,080
file quota group point that was the one that

597
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,360
adds to the same decision of the  user

598
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,610
the execution of the file must have

599
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:09,679
an initial point of sale that comes

600
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,809
we are not closing the circle

601
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,940
scale the

602
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,280
football that you do not say something only that it is 2011 does not

603
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,850
add

604
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:28,710
malicious that the machines capture all

605
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:31,080
the information that the user generates in

606
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,419
files of  text and later to

607
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:36,029
use details to process or specify

608
00:30:36,029 --> 00:30:38,100
an attack

609
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:43,639
well what was said about that file not

610
00:30:44,429 --> 00:30:46,899
in the same machine

611
00:30:46,899 --> 00:30:49,929
find this file size not if

612
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:53,460
we see that on

613
00:30:54,509 --> 00:30:57,030
March 29

614
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:00,390
it is generated and capture

615
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:03,750
user information dry what he did  all

616
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:06,050
transfers

617
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:13,720
and we see that the same March 29 capture

618
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:16,160
by such businesses of mangoes that they

619
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,530
use for all transfers

620
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:20,690
before the username and the

621
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:22,810
co  The password

622
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:29,230
that is used for hostile countries

623
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:33,660
at that point we lack new doubts

624
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,480
because there is a lot of evidence it

625
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,270
is evidence the museum evidence for

626
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,880
a researcher in this type of cases

627
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,040
in which there is no experience we do not

628
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:48,360
differentiate between the novice attacker to

629
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,640
a professional attacker by  the amount

630
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,110
of evidence left by the equipment

631
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:55,399
because the attacker

632
00:31:55,399 --> 00:31:59,899
but professional always complies with

633
00:31:59,899 --> 00:32:03,700
step number seven in the afternoon fingerprints

634
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,649
knows where he enters where he generates the

635
00:32:06,649 --> 00:32:08,179
fingerprints and does not erase

636
00:32:08,179 --> 00:32:11,210
then he enters when looking at the network to a

637
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:14,059
machine he must know where it is generated to

638
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:15,619
choose or  designate is a machine to be

639
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:19,129
able to play and not be detected is not what

640
00:32:19,129 --> 00:32:21,830
you do but in this case there is an

641
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:24,489
inconsistency a very sophisticated attack

642
00:32:24,489 --> 00:32:27,019
to think that some data is again

643
00:32:27,019 --> 00:32:28,179
in

644
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:33,159
evidence which made us think good how the

645
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:35,830
file must feel the point  It must

646
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,470
be the team,

647
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:40,950
it is needless to say that how

648
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:44,059
the points file was enjoyed we have also

649
00:32:44,059 --> 00:32:47,059
executed

650
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,180
and how they were executed or  Another type of

651
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,420
applications,

652
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:55,160
the instance, as there are many evidences,

653
00:32:55,160 --> 00:33:01,790
says that they left hypotheses, we do not want

654
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:04,790
hypotheses,

655
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:08,120
I told him that it is a lot of evidence that they

656
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:12,050
left on purpose to be able to remove

657
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:14,420
legal responsibility from the user of the

658
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:17,180
machine or the bank, it is something

659
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,110
that was consulted

660
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,679
I was not

661
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:23,220
and that was not me, it

662
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:26,429
was to be has collaborated with all the

663
00:33:26,429 --> 00:33:29,929
evidence found in the team

664
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:38,389
because it was an attack but with some

665
00:33:38,389 --> 00:33:41,260
participation within it

666
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:44,110
so that part of the search we left

667
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:48,100
a side apart from the posters because they

668
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,010
knew how to handle it etc.

669
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:53,950
We focus on the analysis of the 32

670
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:56,530
kilos file to know how the same equipment and

671
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:59,620
how the point file is executed how the file was

672
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,230
executed?

673
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:05,740


674
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,429


675
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:13,350


676
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:15,389
of 32

677
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:18,150
points of bs what is the charge of the

678
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:23,310
ip address 229 116 points 60

679
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:26,790
we did a search for the

680
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:29,400
japo rostrum  This

681
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,060


682
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,190


683
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,600
is one of the

684
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,850
platforms that was used in this

685
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:42,000
analysis as well as other commercials that

686
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,719
may have much more because they are

687
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:49,860
in search looking for this.  active of the

688
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,679
'red'

689
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,210
some results

690
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:55,879
and among those

691
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:58,910
well what we have the files

692
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,589
documents points

693
00:35:00,589 --> 00:35:03,730
the first social we had because

694
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:06,079
it found where the

695
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,839
point files were now not covering

696
00:35:08,839 --> 00:35:10,130
point

697
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:12,050
d and we see that they are located

698
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:16,840
within windows the country

699
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:26,090
and  We have natural folders folders

700
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:28,220
that are created if these are

701
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,590
personally where all

702
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:36,569
the files that we open from pain

703
00:35:36,569 --> 00:35:41,740
the post manager are housed in a document an

704
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:46,410
attachment that generates the

705
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,599
active temporary folders and deletes the operational mail we

706
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:54,599
still cannot.

707
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:57,140
I had a lot because we knew that that

708
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,810
file was in this part of

709
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:01,180
here and well

710
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:04,100
that I denied you  vo

711
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:07,550
said they have d & s shares and 12

712
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:13,580
income points

713
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:19,820
now we go for one that was opened and

714
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:22,460
was opened twice because we have the

715
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,410
document point time document home

716
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:27,609
but not

717
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:31,790
doing a search using that is

718
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:33,680
much more powerful that allows us to

719
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,440
recover some deleted data  With

720
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:40,020
the email that has this attachment

721
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,760
we give the problem you have to

722
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,619
points

723
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:47,109
and we see that the mail comes

724
00:36:47,109 --> 00:36:50,230
from Spain Spaniards to be

725
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:54,400
about 2000 points is on March 25,

726
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,660
2015 for together with his quote

727
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:02,410
an

728
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:06,190
ordinary man among the good  and the assets

729
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,530
that you have discover the points but the

730
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:12,730
contents are recovered all the

731
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,160
files first double click to

732
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,880
follow the next steps

733
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,670
we have been executed of

734
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:31,670
course that eating is finding about it

735
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:34,510
and we would have

736
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,270
with this activity we started integrating

737
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:41,150
a little more than more did the  user

738
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:46,400
and we continue to take the file,

739
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,340
these files are very important if you

740
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:52,310
want to leave your user because  It is

741
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:55,760
reactive It is essential to be able to

742
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,000
locate the work

743
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,160
we see that within the

744
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:08,180
recent objects here we have the path within

745
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,270
it

746
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,120
of users

747
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:21,030
we have folders of all the assets

748
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:23,430
that are opened by the user and we have

749
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:24,710
from Greece

750
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:27,020
and we have for each asset that we have  a

751
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:31,430
better value with information that enzyme

752
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:34,520
that will allow us to say which assets

753
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,000
were recently used and

754
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,030
we see that the file from the point

755
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:44,690
should that was accessed by executed in

756
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:48,910
this case by the user by user

757
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:53,030
we do not have in that game

758
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:56,460
also already with this  You can say

759
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,080
what we needed to tie up the dots at the

760
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,380
time point what we did not have

761
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,290
within the general systems of

762
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:06,480
developers and it was executed because

763
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,100
we also found within the

764
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,760
recently opened files it

765
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,590
offers them

766
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:16,460
in the

767
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:19,200
middle of uses and in the example of

768
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,060
pride mean the three

769
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:24,300
most recently used Indians in the

770
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,850
windows registry and look at them prepares  r

771
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:28,410
all the sites where

772
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:32,460
recently human information is recently used

773
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:36,890
by users

774
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:39,630
in this group point that

775
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:46,370
is also by executed

776
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:49,680
since we had to know

777
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,890
[Music]

778
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:53,740
a little research has passed,

779
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,480
transfers can be made from

780
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,090
four of the  late to seven o'clock at night

781
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:01,240
then we decided to analyze what happened

782
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,370
after 7 o'clock at night the user

783
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:05,050
was present in history on the

784
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,300
machine and while managing the equipment, he continued his

785
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:07,870
activity

786
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:11,579
we had files that were worked

787
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:14,130
after what ended and the

788
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:16,160
attacks such as open documents

789
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,859
Edited photographs run sent

790
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:22,680
decided that is, if there was activity

791
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,529
that frustrated his house he continued working

792
00:40:25,529 --> 00:40:29,220
normally after work

793
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:36,390
then since he was the intellectual author

794
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:39,930
because an accomplice that part but Suarez

795
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:42,359
then here when the user was already intervened

796
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:43,770
later called again

797
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:47,640
to face not for  the central part of the

798
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,540
bank appeared the g  Atitos of the

799
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,130
owners who attended the positive

800
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:55,190
of the partner

801
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:57,920
not that not the kings or the characters of

802
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,079
studying positive

803
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:01,479
and that they did not know dark that what it seems

804
00:41:01,479 --> 00:41:04,570
I think that first what it seems

805
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:09,560
reaching the part of the times that they

806
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,650
can or criminal responsibilities or  Not

807
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:15,560
in this part of activities to the user

808
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,800
and to verify the two months and two

809
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,300
of the bank's servers, we see that it is

810
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,330
exactly like this, gentlemen and

811
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:26,990
the IP addresses were reflected, which led to the

812
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:29,980
concession of both one

813
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:33,060
and his

814
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:38,810
206 were detected but not detected legally

815
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:41,630
for the

816
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,970
security devices but we were not

817
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:47,300
arrested here here are

818
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,090
security maps we have to focus a little

819
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,950
more you are not on security at the

820
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:54,680
top a little forgotten you have not completed

821
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,980
a little more your security systems

822
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,990
against this activity we can recreate

823
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:03,260
a lifetime of research

824
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,940
idealism and reactivation of the

825
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,850
relationships events each of these

826
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:10,680
lines of research has its own

827
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,350
their situation and for each one that

828
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:15,170
we raise the death of evidence

829
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:17,860
fully put

830
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:20,710
we see that already recreating the line of

831
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:23,620
investigation we see that we can say

832
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:27,460
with 85 days of the glass arrives an email to which they

833
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,560
can take care of the points of it

834
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:33,730
is two points ls  On March 26,

835
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:35,800
2015

836
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,570
the point of bs

837
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:46,680
116 60 116 on March 27 of the

838
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,450
address and Pérez will be other natives

839
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:51,920
of poor domes

840
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,450
we have on March 31 the pursuit is executed

841
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:59,400
that generates

842
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,490
that the file of from the one of two

843
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:05,010
persists in the  reggae says one that

844
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:07,790
asks when user logs in

845
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:12,950
we have that the goal of the system on

846
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:16,770
March 1 a grant 200 is created

847
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:20,770
and in which the file is downloaded

848
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:26,980
from that other agent from the forest April 4

849
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,549
to headquarters for the last time to the file because

850
00:43:29,549 --> 00:43:34,289
this has no longer been

851
00:43:34,289 --> 00:43:37,520
number

852
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,020
10 on April 10 the attack is consolidated

853
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:44,099
[Music]

854
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,780
the team of the keys

855
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,990
and then building our

856
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:57,040
experiences asia

857
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,500
around here some graphs of conduits of the

858
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,830
attack in  the email to the

859
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:04,600
user to choose our said that it does not

860
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,230
have a manual

861
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:09,660
this is the solution to an

862
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,790
address to an external server where

863
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:14,410
the attacker is located

864
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:20,290
the attacker of the computer

865
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:23,020
this manual instead have August

866
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:27,430
connection time to another absent others

867
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:30,040
and from that  IP address from this

868
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,069
server using the

869
00:44:33,069 --> 00:44:37,920
user's computer since

870
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,220
bank transfers abroad are generated

871
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,470
this would be a graphic technology of

872
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:47,619
how things happened within an

873
00:44:47,619 --> 00:44:50,890
attack an extra malware attack,

874
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:52,730
saving

875
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:56,890
in this part of the conclusions no

876
00:44:56,890 --> 00:45:04,230
and now commented that  It was totally

877
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:06,910
violated

878
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:09,000
and antivirus

879
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,330
are very useful tools in the

880
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:14,820
security issue, they already need other types of

881
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,770
special security or the

882
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:19,950
forensic security that is being implemented to

883
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:22,410
webber the banking entities, not with

884
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:25,800
software that allows monitoring

885
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,280
each of the processes of services and

886
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,860
connections  performed by the user with

887
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:34,050
one comparing with previous

888
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:37,039
configurations  as authorized by the bank

889
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:40,400
that is what I have come to share with

890
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,529
you an experience of this type of

891
00:45:42,529 --> 00:45:46,959
attacks a Chilean with some statistics

892
00:45:46,959 --> 00:45:50,179
on the part of the knowledge of the same and

893
00:45:50,179 --> 00:45:53,900
all the preventions of the case so that

894
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:56,349
national moments come

895
00:45:56,349 --> 00:45:59,680
to try to be attacked by  that type of

896
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,369
attack

897
00:46:00,369 --> 00:46:03,779
thank you very much for your attention

898
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:10,290
thank you very much someone has a

899
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:13,880
question two questions are going to come out

900
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:31,150
hello

901
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:35,110
the question is regarding well here it

902
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:37,890
equals and this happens I do not know if they

903
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:40,750
agree on the amounts that I was returning

904
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:42,200
there

905
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:46,369
but it gives me the impression of  that the

906
00:46:46,369 --> 00:46:49,670
banks there use the second of the

907
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:51,170
certification factors, as in the

908
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:53,780
case that although it is true, there is the same

909
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:56,720
now that for that they put some

910
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,550
more barriers that could make it more

911
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:01,060
difficult

912
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:05,220
with which we live no no because the

913
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:08,059
attack is recurrent old type

914
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:10,950
is  Suppose that they are not using this

915
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:15,078
type of security,

916
00:47:16,869 --> 00:47:19,740
the query

917
00:47:23,849 --> 00:47:29,109
was seen there that the equipment seems to be

918
00:47:29,109 --> 00:47:32,009
very

919
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:45,170
or is complex, now we are going to stop  to be able to

920
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:47,510
comment on the god they did to that is

921
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:51,860
prior to the fact that hissing is detected by

922
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:53,630
the antivirus that the entity has if it

923
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:56,090
garcía those analyzes that it is company to be

924
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:58,100
able to know what type of that it is going to

925
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:01,610
use they analyze or do tests they

926
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:05,060
create the framework of the programming of the

927
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:07,070
platform to know what activities it detects

928
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:10,550
when they will be in the bank because it

929
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:12,860
uses it and new ones and detected because it

930
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:17,170
is already with the previous tests performed

931
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:22,330
ok to the last one now

932
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,480
hello

933
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,539
and

934
00:48:44,539 --> 00:48:47,029
within the presentation you showed

935
00:48:47,029 --> 00:48:50,299
when you look for fabric to read within the

936
00:48:50,299 --> 00:48:53,749
million files in the  windows and

937
00:48:53,749 --> 00:48:56,709
aversion to assets in the rare world

938
00:48:56,709 --> 00:48:59,269
complete 2014

939
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,699
and then later associated with the

940
00:49:01,699 --> 00:49:05,449
son's email on March 23, 2015 how to make

941
00:49:05,449 --> 00:49:08,599
that relationship let's say this active

942
00:49:08,599 --> 00:49:11,359
next to 2014 by the email that arrives at

943
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:13,659
that time

944
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:22,519
one of the first things  that makes the

945
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:25,279
increase of it in the part of the

946
00:49:25,279 --> 00:49:31,150
dates of arturo salah won him what do not

947
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:32,770
coincide

948
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:34,830
a sequence

949
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:36,210
of events that we saw then

950
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:37,800
independently  nte of the dates that are

951
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,569
presented, it is

952
00:49:39,569 --> 00:49:41,150
recorded

953
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:44,260
until this growth,

954
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,180
this is the way, all of the air

955
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:49,310
that the people received was analyzed, it is no longer

956
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:52,430
concentrated and that is what I understand

957
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:54,980
we analyze since they appeared

958
00:49:54,980 --> 00:50:01,110
fully in accordance with the laws

959
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:04,960
so you can follow it

960
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,940
And to you,

961
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:10,370
if everything is fine, thank you

962
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:17,638
[Applause]
