1
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:47,660
I leave you with Camacho what phrases from Chile and I think

2
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,120
that there are not very few doctorates in cryptography

3
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:13,240
in this conference he attended with Gabriel

4
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:22,560
, his name is from those of today

5
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:33,910
after I started

6
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:46,830
and the problem

7
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:55,649
so

8
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,870
and

9
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:15,500
then to encourage even more

10
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,230
I left in this presentation

11
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,170
very well what is

12
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:55,920
something important in 2008

13
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:14,060
and not only five years

14
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:24,340
385 million is something really impressive

15
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,060
300

16
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,050
where there are a lot of variant writers

17
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:50,730
so they have to start thinking what in blue its end to open

18
00:03:53,790 --> 00:04:04,340
respect and it is that I was an hour and obviously

19
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,530
then

20
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,800
action

21
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:28,180
yes

22
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,680
then please

23
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:07,000
if you are that

24
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:12,530
today enter and we will see if paradoxes

25
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,230
how

26
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:28,300
of the missions

27
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:38,120
from anonymity and tranquility then

28
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,050
we will see what is the role of national power

29
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:03,440
to day

30
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:15,740
and the end ok

31
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,220
is not easy

32
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:54,440
around like him a diet system and then what he does is download from the other two

33
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,940
the list of all transactions

34
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:09,890
from the beginning then laws that all that everyone understands

35
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,169
is exactly the same version. ion of history

36
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,240
later to command money from one side to another

37
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:36,170
and the action

38
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:57,219
is how to achieve that these modes agree on the creation of stories because no no

39
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:08,530
then all the magic of it in a technological destruction is in

40
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:19,510
that how to achieve that synchronization this consensus between all those mining nodes

41
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,840
2

42
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:33,049
and from one country to another

43
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,020
good it

44
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:53,680
would be like that it will be a problem but live

45
00:08:54,830 --> 00:09:07,970
with myself with very very low as they handle and leonese something very simple

46
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:16,040
then at the same time

47
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:22,620
and it is like that

48
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:28,480
then

49
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:42,110
things will be your light is what is associated with looking and

50
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:45,710
when you see the balance in that street of what you

51
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:55,140
also know someone

52
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,070
then for another year

53
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:08,840
and in both sectors although I do not know we can dream a little

54
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,240
but before doing it well

55
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,699
and already

56
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,189
him

57
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:34,990
i

58
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:52,080
before although for the other option

59
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,950
i

60
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:26,990
2 that is to say holiness and it is curious where

61
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:41,250
in a physical place because while risks

62
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,750
then there

63
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,760
now

64
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,820
how

65
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:19,610
in the real cost of having 3 million what do I have to do so that not

66
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,740
with magnets

67
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,130
2

68
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:36,700
and he

69
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,910
is like that,

70
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:53,410
let 's see a little meaning to achieve a safe co2 storage

71
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,189
yes no

72
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:18,329
but the game

73
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:33,760
the key and the virtual address that they will receive is

74
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:39,040
carried manually in the meter

75
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,069
please

76
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,920
and for the moment of another and

77
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:06,000
then what to do is have to have to remove the information of the transaction is to

78
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,440
say at least like the people of lincoln and where they are going to be sent

79
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,949
from online

80
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:28,329
and publishes it and the basic transaction

81
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:45,320
there are normal thousands and hours are those keys physically

82
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:55,460
etc.

83
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,939
from where did you get operating and new systems

84
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:15,610
this front and obviously if there are some on the computer line is an oak tree

85
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,790
some record the nine private

86
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:30,150
and there

87
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:44,550
what is in the ruin and how this movement of life is made on line

88
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:57,770
and 7th which explains that in the end

89
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:02,770
how well

90
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:11,579
the main publications of the offline and online world al final

91
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:19,220
as exciting sebelius then it is a book

92
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:31,500
I do not know it worries me enough and more

93
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:40,010
in a way of having others then

94
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:50,510
in the offline world it

95
00:16:52,850 --> 00:17:00,170
is valid that the actions

96
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:08,970
in the place

97
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:14,310
a panta llita for what

98
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:59,670
but he will never let information pass to the blondes they steal money from schools and insurance

99
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,830
but because ah

100
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:27,570
and the things

101
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,419
regulate

102
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:41,980
by the water

103
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:56,210
there are two operations

104
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,330
message

105
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:18,020
them like his

106
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:25,750
to

107
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:38,770
himself changing

108
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:56,940
for what we want to see then that is what he is going to do to

109
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:10,530
sign two shares with the same life but the same one

110
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:25,840
in the end you do not have there is the value that is given for the first

111
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:40,440
there are simply dividends on both sides one had an equation is

112
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:54,180
and then one are values ​​of ending

113
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,040
then

114
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:21,710
the no but

115
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:32,870
this problem consequently

116
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:42,030
3

117
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:52,450
d

118
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:02,470
although people to be able to program games

119
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:19,260
then basically in the culture they have like this

120
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:37,020
and that is the code to choose

121
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:48,260
and then

122
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:52,790
I just showed

123
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:05,750
the software and the help

124
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,150
ok

125
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,490
with this

126
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,919
a diet on their side

127
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:36,709
and that he used a library of and still

128
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:43,650
as such

129
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:48,500
then again the same trick

130
00:23:51,150 --> 00:24:15,570
and something quite impressive because in the end with this woman

131
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:32,510
at 55

132
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,740
and there is the bird, not the one used by those at night, they

133
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,390
keep talking,

134
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:59,300
open those of now

135
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,240
and please

136
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,110
and here

137
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:25,970
I come is basically what it generates

138
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,760
and what not

139
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,590
to remember

140
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:45,879
is really

141
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,820
nothing else

142
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,280
I come I feel like very nice

143
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:15,590
but not the sentence is that it is good it

144
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:28,040
was an

145
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,530
equal please

146
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,950
d

147
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,310
is not here

148
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,990
as the only content is

149
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:17,210
with the technology

150
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:25,090
i

151
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,250
the authorities of the 10

152
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:43,219
then while life is good

153
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:59,580
that this version between with the identity of some man

154
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,610
and that

155
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:07,760
has been very good

156
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,129
and nothing more

157
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,970
difficult social 1

158
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:37,070
and also

159
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:42,530
new money

160
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:46,580
the car site

161
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,590
obviously for all

162
00:28:53,220 --> 00:29:00,150
d

163
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:24,890
that can detect to the mind also how to avoid the water

164
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:49,770
this possibility of leaving its world identity if you leave but this is not totally it

165
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:11,080
is what

166
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:20,840
the same person does not happen to me as two transactions

167
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:31,770
because the information cohen

168
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:39,770
because this information

169
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:51,870
and then although he is

170
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:00,830
things then

171
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:18,650
the information and perhaps they come to reveal the lives of the users

172
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:37,379
chains

173
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:43,379
and then

174
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:58,740
addresses this cycle will begin like the sitar that perhaps there was a prayer in the network

175
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:11,950
but there were many

176
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:22,060
my dream can generate the azu Your identity is

177
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:37,120
enough to give the law where basically yes

178
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:41,020
so

179
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:48,090
so that sadness how

180
00:32:51,090 --> 00:33:00,510
they are different

181
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:24,100
there are people

182
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:38,380
quite

183
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:56,840
like me

184
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:12,310
quite 20 pages who use a diet a lot

185
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:27,540
and a lot of work dt nobody accepts anything else

186
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,940
although national power

187
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:38,370
the visit had

188
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:43,220
How to

189
00:34:45,520 --> 00:35:01,550
work the theme and here I have now

190
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:29,060
and after every 10 minutes that are published

191
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:41,169
depending on his injury how

192
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:47,730
choices of chains and rap

193
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:53,020
and there he enters as the

194
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,330
general interesting wool of him and count

195
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:15,290
later the intention is that he the lottery and The one who wins the lottery is going to have the right to

196
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:24,920
extend that chain and how later to increase my reality of the Canary Islands with computational power

197
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:32,240
x

198
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:50,930
0

199
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,490
in fact

200
00:36:56,450 --> 00:37:00,439
I lie

201
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:09,950
but

202
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:33,009
and then

203
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,610
what

204
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:43,010
basically the race

205
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:56,240
then if one that is not going to be the official one

206
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,420
why to learn

207
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:35,000
and that is very interesting also

208
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:49,210
what defense is to say that of my children and protects with all its computational power to prevent

209
00:38:49,210 --> 00:39:01,260
someone from creating more stories but also if one is a boy if we have a ch ica can be altered

210
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:29,750
for once they send and emblems a global currency of popular action there are people who sanz

211
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:37,450
in history

212
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,399
with computational power

213
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:48,759
how

214
00:39:53,190 --> 00:40:04,980
next to them they plan to make a war how

215
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,920
but no

216
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:28,710
and well that's

217
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:43,810
but national

218
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:57,250
thanks

219
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:08,950
and all

220
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,379
second place power in computing

221
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:18,529
centralization and decentralization

222
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:38,350
is a practice that people tend to be able

223
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:51,790
only that it never goes to more than it

224
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,650
got to

225
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:19,520
and now what

226
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:23,990
are 40

227
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:39,910
and how

228
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,600
topic 3 is

229
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:12,860
that done between the singular and / or

230
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:18,090
the bass

231
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:29,090
still

232
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:37,560
what to do

233
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,170
good this is the 3

234
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:57,170
d

235
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:04,300
people who can How to accept or reject

236
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:08,020
then

237
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:23,310
without further contact and

238
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:31,730
and obviously the technique each one with the condition that they make me and because it is an album that began but

239
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:46,060
also the amount of millions

240
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:49,950
a chaos

241
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:08,040
sometimes that we do not like unleashing the intention to be good there

242
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:18,430
the biggest

243
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:37,390
story

244
00:45:43,000 --> 00:46:00,520
through those casualties of light and a version of the story

245
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,240
here

246
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:25,240
one of the sides all those who do more good I assure you

247
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:45,049
and many but nothing

248
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:55,070
for example around him the impressive author

249
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:04,120
that has not been achieved here

250
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:33,080
and now

251
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,130
grill

252
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:57,540
in the next conference today

253
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:14,960
and show they had 10% the only thing that had been 17 enough to

254
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:29,960
have novelty that has grown percent of things

255
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:33,210
that is the theory of mind

256
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:37,460
because it

257
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:55,010
starts more today Ah to the students that they know

258
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:03,950
that I had a weakness,

259
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:13,549
what is Nicosia 20 years later, good

260
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:28,910
and the constants and they were not understood and at the end of many years they

261
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:34,460
would be

262
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:42,709
for everyone and there was something

263
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:48,310
after an example some

264
00:49:53,820 --> 00:50:00,420
is basically a weakness

265
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:13,530
Why

266
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:26,130
then

267
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:33,380
of things I

268
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:39,210
was currently worried about what

269
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:46,380
but something that

270
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:59,330
is a safe system

271
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:05,270
like blue

272
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:11,450
taxes

273
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:17,140
and many problems

274
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:25,790
ah of the day is that it is

275
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:35,800
ah

276
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:49,480
and today this Peruvian tribe is developing

277
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:05,520
the a line that shows what

278
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:19,370
of an attack

279
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:44,370
and well all that as in this sensation that contradictory feeling bent

280
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:49,890
and with a really surprising and fascinating possession

281
00:52:52,010 --> 00:53:02,300
is more than that

282
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:15,240
but it complicated me but only to be able to treat another also

283
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:35,670
entrances and exits s and all those programs are in

284
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:42,870
things

285
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:55,710
and if there are so many people

286
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:09,620
and that I had more thanks to two who are showing very seasonal

287
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:20,799
i

288
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:29,920
work

289
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:35,060
grant

290
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:41,010
the bill is defended thanks to

291
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:47,740
the doubt for me

292
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:58,700
sometimes there is an article of this year of residency He was talking about inflation on the disk and how

293
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:05,180
countries could reach Louis, the greatest computational power can steal from the networks,

294
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:11,970
so governments that have computational power

295
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:17,670
that have computers, you can try other networks,

296
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:22,570
relationship power point will be zero, it

297
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:36,390
could produce inflation when they are usually used to buy the product

298
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:53,370
d

299
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:57,830
then

300
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:13,589
to compete with the others

301
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:21,920
there are more Asians then we have

302
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:37,540
respect for the communicational power simple cremation and more into account

303
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:46,060
second

304
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:58,380
today
