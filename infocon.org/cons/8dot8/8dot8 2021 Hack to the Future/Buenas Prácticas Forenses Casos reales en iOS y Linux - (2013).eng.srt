00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:05,160
[Applause]

00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:18,480
[Music]

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,440
[Music]

5
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,289
[Music]

6
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,490
Well, they

7
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,230
had a good lunch, yes the truth is, I don't know

8
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,620
anything from above with the spotlight.

9
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,230
Good afternoon. I'm actually not from

10
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,770
Viña del Mar, but almost because my grandfather

11
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,630
did when  From Valparaíso, in

12
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,240
reality, as Gabriel said before, it is

13
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,590
for them an honor that I am here

14
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,900
for me, it is an honor to fight in this square

15
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,510
because after all, as he said well,

16
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,390
I have my parents, they are Chilean,

17
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,130
so I have both  nationalities

18
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,900
in fact I have the dilemma of what

19
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,760
language to give it in and I think that today

20
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,930
I will give it with a Spanish accent and

21
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,060
tomorrow I have two I will give it the other

22
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,950
way so that so that they believe it

23
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,630
is real

24
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,979
well, the title of the talk is called

25
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,050
good forensic practices, real cases

26
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,840
in me and linux, the good one is supposed to

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,820
be crossed out but the font that

28
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,670
there is does not appear and it is because I am going to

29
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,170
tell you how a good forensic analysis is really done

30
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,790


31
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,030
and  I'm going to give you cases in which  s is

32
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,070
how you should not do it

33
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,220
well I do not know if you know me as

34
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,800
Gabriel said well I have been

35
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,200
dedicated to computer security for 13 years, it is the

36
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,750
only thing I know how to do, I hope I know how to do it

37
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,100
well and if not then I will end

38
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:54,970
up starving and the truth is that in the

39
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,860
past I did not  It seemed like I was

40
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,030
dying of hunger, whoever knows me

41
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,270
for 34 months knows it, but now, so he

42
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,100
says [ __ ] that things are wrong in

43
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,429
Spain '

44
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,169
my experience includes having worked

45
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,910
in different integrators

46
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,430
of the Spanish security panorama, then I have been

47
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,930
working in multinationals  a

48
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,120
French woman four years for

49
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,209
web application security one year in

50
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:21,520
strong authentication and well, all the companies

51
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,230
that are making the same mistakes

52
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,260
all the same commercial part

53
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,770
technical part point collide they hit someone

54
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,340
asks a favor to the other side

55
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,590
yes they have asked you to  do this very

56
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,420
well as it took me a week to

57
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,590
do it that will ask again it's going to take

58
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,200
two weeks to screw them all

59
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,930
In the end, who loses with all this the

60
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,180
clients who decided to set up my own

61
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,730
company in which that does not

62
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,110
exist, there are no such problems and the client

63
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,610
comes first, the company in fact is called

64
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,819
securizing dotcom security, I am the cto,

65
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:57,810
the cs, or the boss, or the ceo.  the cn whatever it

66
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,430
is or because it is me and my circumstance

67
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,310
I am a quasi-judicial forensic computer expert I

68
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,500
belong to an

69
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,480
association called act national association of

70
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,340
cybersecurity and technological expertise

71
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,019
I believe the truth that the acronym is

72
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:16,650
given to me frankly bad and good I have

73
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,750
cisp certifications  ecisa and all these

74
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,250
happy things that look so good in the

75
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,810
curriculum that every year they force you

76
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,459
to pay to continue being in good

77
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,099
standing no but I'm already editor of the blog

78
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:27,540
security by default who is from here you

79
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,660
know the curitiba default

80
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,710
not too many

81
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,470
new readers then

82
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,750
I have developed tools like secure

83
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,130
wing, it was a tool that I started to

84
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,780
develop and the game tool is

85
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,900
halfway there because at last  By

86
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,760
working for a manufacturer at the

87
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,200
time I did not want to have problems, we tested it was

88
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,580
used for what a

89
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,050
windows security tool is used to make them

90
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,090
safe and then from the

91
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,830
view I was bored to see that

92
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,410
nothing started and inside and from  from

93
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,000
there I left it and for now it is stagnant

94
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,620
one day I will recover it to my spammer is

95
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,990
a tool that is in all

96
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,450
distributions based on debian and serves

97
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,940
to get ahead of

98
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,270
system administrators to get ahead of checking that

99
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,490
the ips registers of the ip addresses

100
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,209
of the mx records  dns of a

101
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:17,298
given domain are not in more than

102
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,548
90 black list so that you can

103
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:22,140
anticipate that if you have a bug

104
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,740
that at any given time has been

105
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,150
guilty of making your ip address is to

106
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,400
have a rb l on a reputation black list

107
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,530
then  Well, at least it

108
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,300
helps you to make sure your

109
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,849
company's email doesn't start to degrade.

110
00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:38,009
A forensic tool can escape. Well,

111
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:39,749
you can follow me.  go on twitter as the web

112
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:42,689
security by default and others is not

113
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:44,339
like the simpsons they will know me I am troy

114
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:46,750
mcclure good because that

115
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,820
I am quite accessible as you can see you

116
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:52,450
can contact me anything I promise to

117
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,150
answer all the emails prioritized

118
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,560
in case they come with a name of  Woman it is

119
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,260
worth that you have it clear and as origin

120
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,580
and well it

121
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,850
takes me a long time because I am traveling

122
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,080
I am with a lot of work and in the

123
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,430
end well well but I promise that I

124
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,050
answer everything even from the bathroom

125
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:12,250
okay but well as I say I travel a lot and

126
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,350
in fact in each  country in which I go because

127
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,580
I find situations that

128
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,770
cause me tremendous grace last year

129
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,810
in Colombia what you see

130
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:23,610
as funny in Spain '

131
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,479
walesa was a very popular guy this

132
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,879
week and I can only assure the

133
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:33,099
composition, an Argentine told me the  Again

134
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:33,940


135
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,139
in fact good this is also in

136
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:36,460
Colombia found on the site that I

137
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,810
really liked the room of

138
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,639
good sacrifices there is better than in Bolivia I was

139
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,440
last week

140
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,210
There is a cotton ball called cocoon

141
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,180
I said that I put in Chile I am going to a

142
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,190
store of these where they make what in

143
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,660
Spain we call the pools or the

144
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,430
lottery to the [ __ ] goal no that is also

145
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,170
a funny thing because no but yesterday

146
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,120
I found something  that made me laugh

147
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,160
lame 9 he also said I'm going to take advantage of

148
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,420
to see how many of

149
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,390
this one can be taken

150
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,200
to sell, well let's go to the nougat

151
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,420
for real I have said that I'm going to teach

152
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,790
you about forensic analysis okay let's

153
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,590
start talking about first  Certain

154
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,660
forensic concepts, we watch

155
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,090
TV and we see that the typical thing is that

156
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,650
you find a corpse thrown on the

157
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,390
ground or here in the front row, hour

158
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:23,390
after the day of the final judgment, okay and well

159
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,980
, that's what happens, the

160
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,720
police cordon off  the lady area there is

161
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,640
nothing to see do not be apá nahueve more it

162
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:34,280
will be total that in the end if it is that

163
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,900
but you have to orient it to the digital point of

164
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,060
view or you have to orient it

165
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,410
to find a machine that has been

166
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,240
c  committed and you have to know how to

167
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,820
act especially if you intend to sue

168
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,800
or intend to do so from a judicial point of

169
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,310
view

170
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,960
then I want to comment on a couple of

171
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,540
forensic concepts in which it is

172
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,490
essential to preserve the evidence the

173
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,620
evidence is to say something that can serve as

174
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,090
proof that  it can serve

175
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,710
as a later evidence in a

176
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,210
trial, it must be

177
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,650
preserved, its integrity must be preserved, that is, it is not worth it

178
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,690
that this is the knife and has

179
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,430
everyone's fingerprints - of the murderer because

180
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,410
they have already been covered all here, it is necessary to

181
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,370
do what  itself and for that we have to

182
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,270
do it well

183
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,770
we are going to talk about the chain of custody

184
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,410
as a document in which each of

185
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,120
these evidences that have to be

186
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,980
properly documented and let's say

187
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,650
if with assigning a name a code

188
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,600
to each of the evidences code of

189
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,970
evidence of case code is worth the

190
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,380
chain of custody is a document in

191
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,540
which it is indicated by which hands have been

192
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,250
passed each of them  as evidence

193
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,700
dated with the reason that evidence code

194
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,950
is etc

195
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,440
as I say label that new word

196
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,690
label and document that is, this is

197
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:44,620
the knife

198
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,420
this is the hard drive this is the

199
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,480
pendrive this is the mail server h is

200
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,260
worth labeling and documenting and sealing

201
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,210
o  So you can even say, don't look at

202
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,860
this, it was sealed on that date, it has

203
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,950
a seal with a mark on it,

204
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,180
like what was seen in the movies in the

205
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,070
past, to know that planck and open

206
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,420
is the mark, sir, you

207
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,100
are a witness, there are a lot of people.  Reliable

208
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,420
that sees that this is conveniently

209
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,200
preserved

210
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,360
the order in which we have to capture

211
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,950
the evidences that we have to acquire

212
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,590
those evidences from those that

213
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,450
have a higher volatility index than the one

214
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,120
that have a lower one, that is, a

215
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,670
flash memory will logically have a

216
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,380
much volatility index  less than a

217
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,720
ram memory not normal is first you

218
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,090
find the machine turned on do not

219
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:32,150
pay it maybe it isolates it removes the cable

220
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:35,390
Well, I believe it and I cloth the

221
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,919
network cable in an avila that is

222
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,090
different so that it continues transmitting,

223
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,919
detect the link and continue transmitting, we will

224
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,590
analyze that traffic for example and

225
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,420
then from there we start

226
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,400
extracting ram memory

227
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,320
afterwards once  We are clear that

228
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,690
what we have hot extracted

229
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,550
cannot be anything else, we pull the cable

230
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,620
directly, nothing to turn it off in a

231
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,140
well-turned-off way, if we do not pull the cable,

232
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:01,400
because if we turn off then it is a

233
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,990
windows linux or not the windows maybe

234
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,790
if not  you do so reinstall it

235
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,750
but not the same then

236
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:11,619
if it is a linux we pull the cable and

237
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:14,259
prevent the correct shutdown of the

238
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:16,149
services over write

239
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:19,720
temporary files delete old files over

240
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,759
write the swap a series of things

241
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,679
then we pull the cable and then

242
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:26,559
we analyze clone the  disk and

243
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:29,319
we analyze the copy of the disk in a

244
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,869
procedural way, there with

245
00:09:31,869 --> 00:09:34,779
tools, these are really ways

246
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:36,129
of how things are done.  s with

247
00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:38,229
the [ __ ] song that I send me

248
00:09:38,229 --> 00:09:41,079
later but let's see how I say ram and

249
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:43,179
schwab dams that is to say today sorry it's

250
00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:44,259
true that there is a simultaneous translator

251
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:46,029
has to be at the same hanging

252
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:47,919
egg with which he already spoke very quickly excuse me

253
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:50,369


254
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,250
the cocoa  Really, and he's looking at me, he

255
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,750
has seen that red bull was going to get

256
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,800
into oats, that's why God,

257
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:01,559
but good analysis of the rúa analysis

258
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,509
of his app is important because the smooth one

259
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:04,859
is an extension of the branch when you

260
00:10:04,859 --> 00:10:06,299
have no more memory to do it  you write

261
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:08,160
on a piece of paper next to it because both the

262
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,529
extraction of the brain and the paper that,

263
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:12,569
although it has no structure,

264
00:10:12,569 --> 00:10:14,769
is something that we will have to look at

265
00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:16,449
read only this is a very

266
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,239
important concept to preserve the

267
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:21,399
evidence point 1 one of the things we

268
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:24,119
do is analyze each  one of the

269
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:27,100
evidences or rather copies of the

270
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,110
evidences after all in read

271
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,939
only mode so that to prevent our

272
00:10:30,939 --> 00:10:33,189
partners from contaminating precisely

273
00:10:33,189 --> 00:10:35,829
even a copy why  and why is it

274
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:37,869
made on a copy for various reasons

275
00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:39,500
first

276
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,750
the original evidence if you alter it does not

277
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,900
serve second if you send yourself a [ __ ]

278
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,480
analyzing an original evidence

279
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,980
you can no longer leave it as it is and if you

280
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,050
put a dungeon and the one it had is

281
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,230
also not worth it  In fact, I usually

282
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,360
make two copies or work on a

283
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,250
copy of the copy so that if

284
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,260
he sent me one in the second copy, I

285
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,330
start through the first copy,

286
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,610
then read only a concept in

287
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:08,360
which we mount something, we analyze a

288
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,920
portion of the disk.  or a

289
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,410
disk partition or an entire disk in raw

290
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,390
directly in read-only so we are

291
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,400
sure that we do not touch anything

292
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,350
or modify even a parameter of

293
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,240
creation or modification of a file

294
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,459
images to efe efe advanced forensics and

295
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:26,940
format is a fairly common format

296
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,760
used  in all forensic analysis tools it

297
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,680
is a standard thing

298
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,050
ok so we are going to talk now

299
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,450
because these are concepts and now we are going

300
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,860
to talk about h  tools is to say with

301
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,500
which tools we apply these

302
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,930
concepts and with how we are going to work

303
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:45,209
then what do you think that everything costs a

304
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:47,279
fortune and that there are tools that

305
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,589
are paid and very expensive it is true

306
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:53,510
however linux to the rescue is worth it and we see

307
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,790
different linux distributions

308
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,950
that  They bring each of these tools

309
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,720
as best selected as possible by

310
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,279
each of the distributors, it is worth for each

311
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:03,630
one of those who have generated that

312
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,940
distribution so that to make our

313
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,890
lives easier and be able to face

314
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,480
each of those phases of

315
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,760
forensic analysis then I  What I always say

316
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,240
is that we really can, the good

317
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,740
forensic analyst, the good forensic expert,

318
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,660
has to always carry a

319
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,010
Linux distribution that you want,

320
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,180
because being on the beach on vacation

321
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:27,580
here as we are but always with a

322
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,170
CD is brought them all because if not to

323
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,370
the best thing is seen something more

324
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,880
all forensic life distributions as

325
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,670
I say is the cs kit and it is the kit with

326
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,070
which we go  Let's go to work, okay, and

327
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,980
we have, for example, the ix with warm

328
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,230
matrix different linux distributions

329
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,320
that already bring all the kinds of

330
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,880
tools for each of the phases

331
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,440
as equals I have simply put a

332
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,029
screenshot of each one, the ix is a

333
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:55,800
fairly well-known one.

334
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,200
Free version has a pro version in fact I

335
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,560
like it a lot because of course it

336
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,570
mounts it on a cd or on a usb

337
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,740
of the old ones that had

338
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,029
write protection there is still

339
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:08,610
some of those is worth so that

340
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:11,010
even in a windows it brings a partition

341
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,900
It starts in read only mode because you

342
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,220
are not starting on a medium that

343
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,200
is physically impossible to write to the

344
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,170
ticket and from there it

345
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,610
has tools to

346
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,829
acquire evidence

347
00:13:22,829 --> 00:13:24,510
in hot windows systems apart from being

348
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,970
a separate linux distribution to create

349
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,790
the case and  To do absolutely all

350
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:33,029
the forensic analysis management, one that

351
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:34,800
I really like is Cain, it is an

352
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,980
Italian distribution, it is very graphic.  fica is

353
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,329
the one they use on all

354
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:41,760
forensic analysis courses because of how simple to

355
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,339
use it is, it has here an icon that

356
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:46,199
as you can see it is in green if they

357
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:47,880
take away the light now it is that this

358
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,080
follows me here

359
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:55,690
good silver to full focus  As I say

360
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:58,630
the green icon what it says is sure

361
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,310
that now if you connect to any

362
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,440
removable device I will mount it in

363
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,690
read-only mode if you change it, it

364
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,610
costs a triumph to change them, you have to

365
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,750
give it a lot of things to say

366
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,340
are you  sure but really sure

367
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,300
you want to mount it in read-

368
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,560
write so if you mount it, mount it

369
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,050
then you give it and you can mount something,

370
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,760
read-write, but by default it

371
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,710
tells you that everything I'm mounting is

372
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,110
read-only, I insist that this

373
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,960
concept is essential.  ftc

374
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,970
is another distribution thanks to

375
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,920
working for it because I stole your image

376
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,070
and such but good is worth another distribution

377
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,740
also thought from the beginning

378
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,840
for forensic analysis to in  ciden

379
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,220
response

380
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,340
matrix this is a mixed hybrid distribution

381
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,100
because it has a theme

382
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,120
of forensic tools but it also has

383
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,860
attack tools so as

384
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,240
I say if you go to the beach and in our case it

385
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,590
is very easy because the cds only

386
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:50,160
has to cover here it is worth in the end

387
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,600
with  Carry a single cd

388
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,020
because you can do everything, no and then

389
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,150
of course lime and lime and linux, which in the

390
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,620
past is what you know

391
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,780
as bacteria I suppose as lime and

392
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,920
all of us who are here know this

393
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,840
distribution because we have all done

394
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,180
things with this type of tool  not

395
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,719
all good,

396
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,340
this distribution has a

397
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,530
boot mode in life mode that says forensic

398
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,570
mode,

399
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,940
what does this mean, it does two things

400
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,730
first, it starts, it is mounted in read-only mode,

401
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:23,640
any disk device, whether

402
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,820
physical or virtual, that we have connected

403
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,130
to this machine, is valid for this system  that

404
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:32,100
is booting and on the other hand that does not

405
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,560
mount does not use the partitions that

406
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,880
are defined with a

407
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,130
fic system  heros swap does not use them as its

408
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:41,400
own because because if we have thrown the

409
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,920
cable as I said before and it uses its

410
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,050
own forensic analysis system the

411
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,850
partition of its app for its own swap

412
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,650
you could only overwrite data then

413
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:54,319
do not use a swap that is not yours

414
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,750
and  then we have so much that this I like a

415
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,730
lot of forensics life and especially

416
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,460
because lately everything is mobile everything is

417
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,490
mobile devices therefore this

418
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:07,190
distribution is based and includes

419
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,080
tools it is an ubuntu if I'm not

420
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,850
mistaken it includes tools for

421
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,710
forensic analysis of mobile devices

422
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,450
from even  blackberry I would swear I had

423
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,690
seen somewhere but both iphone

424
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:19,910
android etc. ok

425
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,430
and well this is a bit the world of

426
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,810
forensic analysis distributions that

427
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,060
we see that we have available to do

428
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,830
things ok but I am going to tell you a bit

429
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,390
what we really see in  TV

430
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:32,420
because on TV we usually watch things because

431
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,010
they catch our attention,

432
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:36,650
really, César tomorrow or Monday  ego I do not know when the

433
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:38,120
hell we will see more things about that ok

434
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,940
but we see things that we say this this

435
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,680
is not possible ok this these are good

436
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,900
forensic computer experts is

437
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,740
posting on his blog

438
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:50,089
for weeks I have been investigating

439
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:52,369
the murders of the homicidal taxi driver with a

440
00:16:52,369 --> 00:16:54,229
certain morbid fascination and it is  in

441
00:16:54,229 --> 00:16:57,079
real time I will create a graphical interface with

442
00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:00,758
visual basic to see if it locates its ip

443
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:09,280
and in visuals and wars

444
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,780
because they do not do it in clipper better well

445
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,420
what I mean is how do you see the

446
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,950
movies we see things well how good that

447
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,510
they can be done by themselves  you can do

448
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,609
but but come on, they give us a bit of the

449
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:23,230
feeling, I don't want to screw up the

450
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,660
talk tomorrow with Cesar, I

451
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,829
think he has some of this too,

452
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:30,670
but simply because from a forensic point of

453
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,470
view we can find something

454
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,860
else, this eye to  the details eye for

455
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,730
details

456
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,770
there are no reflective surfaces and the

457
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:43,400
windows are covered not all here the

458
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,870
comments

459
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:48,120
to people and I'll see if you don't mind what  and I

460
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,500
join the investigation I suggest that

461
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,700
we go to the next room

462
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,660
expanding

463
00:17:54,429 --> 00:17:57,960
what is that buildings is a bridge

464
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,100
compare the bridges of the city to see

465
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,119
if it matches this image

466
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,830
aha the wise tom which means that it

467
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,600
is in the southeast but  we need another

468
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,850
coordinate to locate it,

469
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:14,949
put the sound again but this time 5 cis

470
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:18,640
and its cousin also the traffic

471
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,290
that is the subway and not just any subway is

472
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,030
an elevated track. I'll take the map of the subway

473
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,160
to see that it coincides with the approximate line of

474
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,360
sight

475
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,479
[Music  ] It

476
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,820
is the fast line of Pelham

477
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,630
that seems to be the closest

478
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,570
a station of values

479
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:44,120
the station of the avenue has been left

480
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:52,809
[Music]

481
00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:56,080
we have it 156 of avenue 48 in the

482
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,120
bronx that the rescuers of reims come

483
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:05,419
1

484
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,549
that is to say

485
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:14,509
as you see  here this is easy anything goes

486
00:19:14,509 --> 00:19:17,100
in a minute and a bit and look at the

487
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,360
peak I have not put it I already say that this

488
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,679
comes from before

489
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,509
at least not today I did not put it today

490
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,680
in this it exists in Spain does not strain give

491
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,520
milestone then I will explain it to you

492
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,970
bas  What is it that we see here? The

493
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,799
man is dark, this color that he has

494
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:36,260
seen directly, does not have

495
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,000
cameras instead of eyes, the close uncle, in fact,

496
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,309
there is a point here, I do not know based on

497
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:42,169
a point from the one taken here from God.  It is

498
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:44,090
Christ I know how long it took to arrest

499
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,590
bin laden one, I say because they did not have

500
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:50,500
this compadres to see in short,

501
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,080
that is to say many times in a computer expert's report

502
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,230
in a forensic expert's report,

503
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,150
you no longer have the body there that is cold and

504
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,040
such and is rotting  Instead, you have

505
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,150
to act in real time and maybe

506
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,460
you are saved because a life is something

507
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,430
so it is important to act quickly and

508
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,510
know how to do these things and you have to

509
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,250
program something because the program

510
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,810
is accepted before direct monthly, you see

511
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,060
and then the now will be missing.

512
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,710
the net point is needed this from behind and such but

513
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,870
do not worry all are done then

514
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:19,090
you have to have eyes you have to have cameras

515
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,410
from a forensic analysis point of view

516
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,360
you cannot leave even the slightest of

517
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,190
the  metadata without looking, that is, you have to

518
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,220
do it, anything goes, it always comes to

519
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,250
mind when you go up in a car forum,

520
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,980
in a car forum,

521
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,680
the last thing you have done to you

522
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,820
to you to your car and directly you say

523
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,190
look  I have put him on the gear lever

524
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,770
I have put a carbon vinyl on it,

525
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,210
hey, I am really [ __ ] good

526
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,999
and you take pictures of him in turn

527
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:51,189
and people start commenting and say hey

528
00:20:51,189 --> 00:20:53,679
but and you don't have it, your car doesn't consume much

529
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,389
because  Here it says that consumption

530
00:20:55,389 --> 00:20:58,239
is 14 liters at 100 and you listen to that

531
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,979
shitty music but he said but you are

532
00:20:59,979 --> 00:21:01,089
a little gay

533
00:21:01,089 --> 00:21:03,999
but hey and on top of that if you see a

534
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:05,679
passenger's leg, I don't even tell you that

535
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,179
you want to look at the gear lever that

536
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:08,559
is what I am saying how good I

537
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,669
have been, how proud I am of that,

538
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:12,569
because nothing people are really good

539
00:21:12,569 --> 00:21:15,159
forensics in the forums because I am going to

540
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:18,129
tell a real case of a linux system

541
00:21:18,129 --> 00:21:20,469
a real case that happened to a

542
00:21:20,469 --> 00:21:22,989
super client  important and really good  d

543
00:21:22,989 --> 00:21:24,990
happened to me

544
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:28,490
and a linux system I put you in a situation

545
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,750
basically it's any day 'a

546
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,580
Tuesday a Wednesday at two in the

547
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,140
morning time to go to bed okay

548
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:37,309
tomorrow we will have to do something

549
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:40,190
I close the lid of the sea I'm going to the

550
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,649
bed I'm going down the hall and I see in

551
00:21:42,649 --> 00:21:46,789
the adsl router I see that the lights looked like

552
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:48,409
a

553
00:21:48,409 --> 00:21:50,779
Welsh Easter tree that was jumping everything that was a

554
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:53,240
barbarism I well how strange I say my

555
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,919
girlfriends I hear her snore from there from the

556
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:56,070
bed

557
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,290
I am not getting off  Nothing from any

558
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,000
p2p network because I don't do that, I don't know if

559
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,580
someone from here who is going to leave

560
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,350
later like this, but well the star is

561
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:07,020
that I don't do that.

562
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,400


563
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,320
So far it can't

564
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,180
be 2 in the morning,

565
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,300
something's going on, that's good, I go

566
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,190
back to the living room, I open the laptop

567
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:20,520
again, I connect and I see several things, on the

568
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,430
one hand, I find that the router,

569
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,650
as I say, had excessive activity, the

570
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,570
load on the machine  that me  The internet takes out a

571
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:29,370
bad gateway, what an internet message in

572
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:31,290
which I have all the more traps with a

573
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,360
Chinese movie.

574
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,500


575
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,120


576
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,700


577
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,120
As well as 4 megabytes, I say 4 megabytes that

578
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,090
I have 100 megabytes of fiber optic download,

579
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,530
so I was browsing

580
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:52,410
great here, nothing was happening,

581
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:55,470
however, of course 4 megabytes, there is something that

582
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:57,090
does not fit, okay, no, it is not doing

583
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:00,090
well, which is what I used initially,

584
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:00,870
good

585
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:03,120
calm it is 2 in the morning we are going to

586
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,500
fix this to see what the hell is

587
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,410
happening then we start tools

588
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:09,360
like I say like and petrov they help me to

589
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,090
see the bandwidth occupied in

590
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,590
each of the interfaces is the only

591
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,480
interface that was that had a lot

592
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,890
traffic was the external one that

593
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:19,170
takes me to the internet and as I say like 4

594
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:22,740
megabytes held against cepeda well

595
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,960
that seemed like a matrix I dropped the

596
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,940
letters that you can't imagine jce start  or to

597
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,880
see a lot of traffic all to a single

598
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,160
port I think it was 80 88 if I am not

599
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,480
wrong if port 80 88 and a hell

600
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,570
I have there that they have put me here if

601
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:40,920
this does not sound to me I do not have that

602
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,179
service

603
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:43,980
put  tat the same to see connections

604
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,540
well there was a tremendous Christ of

605
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,460
connections is not and with top it was worth me to

606
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,539
see the load of the machine

607
00:23:49,539 --> 00:23:52,509
this is what I did that will be good or

608
00:23:52,509 --> 00:23:54,789
bad but it was 2 in the morning I

609
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:55,720
wanted to go to  the bed the next day I

610
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,269
would have things to do but something I had

611
00:23:58,269 --> 00:23:59,700
to do

612
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,580
then I start looking at port 188

613
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,100
and I see that the process that has that

614
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,370
port is the apache you win mod, I

615
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:12,240
do not play, it is money, you will see that you have

616
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,769
to report incidents

617
00:24:13,769 --> 00:24:15,450
The other day we were talking to the flats

618
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,850
yesterday we have to report incidents

619
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,350
by law I don't know what good luck I

620
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:22,799
'm not in the US but here not in Spain I

621
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,019
don't want to say I find this piece

622
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:28,289
inside the Apache I say when I have done

623
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:31,200
this and that  I see I have a

624
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,820
virtual  host that listens on port 80

625
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,679
88 and the public ip,

626
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:37,830
curiously, proxy request on at 2 in

627
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,809
the morning says this, well, it is worth what I

628
00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:42,750
put there, I believe it, then next to

629
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,970
when you get to a bar that says

630
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,350
I don't remember what I put it  I have now put

631
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,760
as I had a fais proxy because that is what I

632
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,210
remember where it sent it to an IP that

633
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:53,010
I have on a tomcat server on another

634
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:55,470
machine to the tom cat port gps bar

635
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:58,680
and I say host I know what

636
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,960
this is this is that I have a device in  My

637
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,050
car that every minute sends through

638
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:08,040
a 3g interface sends the gps position

639
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,800
latitude and longitude where my car is

640
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,220
at each moment and that sends it to the

641
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,930
only public IP I have and from there it is

642
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:18,390
only forwarding to a tomcat that processes it

643
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,340
and it is saving in a database that

644
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,630
helps me to see if my

645
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:24,350
car has been stolen where the hell is it good then

646
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:28,190
I say good and what do I have?

647
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,850


648
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:35,600


649
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,090
request on are you

650
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,590
saying  do that you open your legs

651
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:41,269
happily and that you are generous with the

652
00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:43,009
world and that what you want is that they are

653
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:45,110
used next that is to say it serves as

654
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,929
next outgoing and incoming I only

655
00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:50,779
wanted next incoming verse but that is

656
00:25:50,779 --> 00:25:53,269
close to the importance of a [ __ ]

657
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:57,080
letter  of on off it is ok with being good and that is to

658
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,639
say ok you have no [ __ ] idea this

659
00:25:58,639 --> 00:25:59,899
the copies of I do not know where I clearly

660
00:25:59,899 --> 00:26:01,490
copied a test that I did of something else

661
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:03,740
but it has a tremendous crime because

662
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,539
because I have worked four years in a

663
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:07,279
company that was a  uav a web

664
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,049
application firewall based on Apache

665
00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:11,029
that I know this as the Lord's Prayer

666
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:12,620
is done I know better this than the

667
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,559
Lord's Prayer is valid then in the end this

668
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:17,570
obviously did not have to

669
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:19,220
know what I find in the blogs

670
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,840
I start to look at the  blogs and what

671
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,510
was expected was something like when you see

672
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,610
a get to be proxy fight with data line

673
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:28,820
the email of the card and the coordinates

674
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,400
in the format to this dodgy, well,

675
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,470
this is what I received or  hey well

676
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,510
you send it high in catia run that

677
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,520
is what there was really I can't

678
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,290
tell you because I still don't know if it has prescribed

679
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,420
not from 2011 this has not yet prescribed

680
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,309
what was there

681
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:46,090
I start to look up

682
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:50,049
well there was how I have to aim  4 GB

683
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:52,740
of logs in three days

684
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,630
and I start looking up late for a

685
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,880
little while I assure you and I find that

686
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,150
the last the first the first

687
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:02,130
entry of the eye after a lot

688
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:04,950
like the ones you see above was this get

689
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,260
graduate are dot com  proxy header I

690
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:11,420
do not know what it is worth and the next one was http

691
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:15,860
at 06 30 and 60 66 30 and 60 32 and the

692
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,080
next next two points

693
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,280
I do not know what and then

694
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,310
well what is this point program

695
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:26,490
investigating by proxy fire proxy fire

696
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:30,800
is that proxy fica  I'm not basically

697
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,600
part of a botnet after all, to

698
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,000
call it that, it is part of an

699
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,860
altruistic service that the Chinese generally use,

700
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,200
okay, the Chinese have all

701
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,460
the [ __ ] right to watch porn just like

702
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,650
everyone else in the world.  ema is

703
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:45,420
that in their country they do not want them to watch porn,

704
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,010
at least we don't, that's why

705
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,390
Chinese come out all over the place but they

706
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,290
can't see porn

707
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:53,000
so in the end

708
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,790
it won't be the most populated country in the

709
00:27:56,790 --> 00:28:00,870
world that makes this tool this

710
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,280
tool will help you  It allows you to mount a

711
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,380
local proxy server on your machine that

712
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,450
what it does is take advantage or tunnel hoist

713
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:09,660
by shocks various machines with my

714
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,190
configuration is like the one I had, it is

715
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,260
worth and that they had proxies open to the

716
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,809
world, that is, it was the closest thing to being

717
00:28:15,809 --> 00:28:18,300
a node of  exit from the tor network but with

718
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,570
Chinese it

719
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:24,539
was the network such is that back

720
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:28,389
but at the end I say hostia good

721
00:28:28,389 --> 00:28:31,119
well fix the [ __ ] that of the

722
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:33,500
apprentice the apache

723
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,900
and well now now now I tell you

724
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,820
but basically the first thing I said was

725
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:42,140
ostia proxy fire a  One of the things that it

726
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,550
does is that, in addition,

727
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,500
each node is scanning different and

728
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,850
therefore different networks and

729
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,190
Internet Perez and what it does is as

730
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:51,230
soon as it finds one, it notifies it to the

731
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,880
central or a botnet of [ __ ]

732
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,560
who calls the schüco bar where

733
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,790
they eat them in case as in the control

734
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:59,330
and says hey you that this IP and this port

735
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:02,420
give him that we have another ticket and in fact it

736
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:05,270
has a series of blacklists  from

737
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,820
junot scan the ip of the white house of the

738
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,290
pentagon of the density sites that

739
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,630
good that it is not appropriate to do

740
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:14,140
an enema for that just in case and that

741
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,980
mistakes made because on the one hand

742
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,630
first as sysadmin I made several

743
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:22,930
mistakes a bad configuration true

744
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,180
correct because  Well, because of the rush,

745
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,710
possibly because I made a copy paste

746
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:29,020
a copy-paste of a configuration that I

747
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,670
had been trying on something else and

748
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,290
I got it, I released it ai I modified what

749
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,870
I wanted and it was

750
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:36,660
then as sysadmin ok I deserve

751
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,940
some other lash but no  six

752
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,440
bad guys

753
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,960
as a forensic analyst and with that I

754
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,480
deserve the gallows because first there is

755
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,850
no system that is, all the things

756
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:49,440
I told you before you have to do this I

757
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,170
insisted I have passed  r there okay there is

758
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:55,320
no system at any time I

759
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,910
did nothing of everything else nor did I acquire

760
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:59,610
data nor hasi nor evidence nor label

761
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:01,830
nor Christ who founded it I did not do any of

762
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,840
that directly I sat down at the foot of

763
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,910
leganer what the hell the legañas fell on me

764
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:08,480
From the dream that I had

765
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,880
more things I used the

766
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,200
system tools that is, if they had

767
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,419
compromised the machine, well

768
00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:17,660
compromised they could have taken the machine away from

769
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,929
me, it could have changed me to

770
00:30:19,929 --> 00:30:22,220
commands so that when they did ps

771
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,049
- efe I could see everything except what the uncle

772
00:30:24,049 --> 00:30:27,230
who trojan did me  I wanted us to do not

773
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:29,390
want it to look bad so

774
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,010
from there use system tools

775
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:33,559
even though the tool, although the

776
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:35,480
command itself was fine, it may be

777
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,919
that what trojan did was the

778
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:38,450
library from which the command was pulled, for

779
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:41,179
example a strip tcp  The ppk reads them

780
00:30:41,179 --> 00:30:43,160
from behind, then from there,

781
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,740
if someone changed you, explain them, it is everything

782
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,020
except what the uncle wants you to not

783
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,530
see

784
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:51,840
the unsigned evi  deviously, this

785
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,310
could not happen only to the civil guard

786
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:56,550
so delete güipe and let it be what God

787
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:59,130
wants and that the fbi do not come for me

788
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,630
because the chinese have gotten off beteta

789
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,400
know what to run and aarón but hey

790
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,130
then what should have  been

791
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,710
criminal and if it is correct to first use

792
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:10,440
tools from units that are

793
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,060
read-only, that is, it would have to have

794
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,730
started some other type of system at

795
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:17,460
a given time for tools

796
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,250
that were compiled directly that

797
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,050
is tactically worth not having

798
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:24,570
extra library dependencies for

799
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:27,330
below but you directly execute and

800
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:28,800
what you are executing is the

801
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,300
tool loads memory the tool itself is

802
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,420
worth that is what it

803
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,830
should have done to

804
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,899
have used some kind of

805
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:38,490
routing analyzer from removable media, for

806
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:40,679
example, such as ch k rootkit or

807
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:42,659
erc a  hunter to see if in that case I

808
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:44,730
had any malware that had been

809
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:47,090
plugged into the machine,

810
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:49,040
what else did I do or had to  having

811
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,830
made use of rpm minus capital v

812
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:54,410
this was a linux distribution with an

813
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:56,720
accent s ok that is a distribution

814
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,910
that you know is based on grids red

815
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:01,940
hat uses rpm as a

816
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,730
package system they are not those of pxom rpm and

817
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:07,880
therefore rpm minus capital v

818
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,820
It is less verify all that is, it checks

819
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,010


820
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:14,950
each of the files that exist in

821
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,780
each for each of the files in

822
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,570
the su jas filesystem and checks

823
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:23,590
that it does machine with what it should with

824
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,900
what it really should have, how

825
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,680
does

826
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,750
rpm maintain a  database of

827
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,640
each of the packages and each of the

828
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,260
files that each package brings,

829
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,790
then from there you check the hash of

830
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,350
each of them and if something has

831
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,630
changed it tells you at least if someone has

832
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:40,120
changed a file for me  I would find out more or

833
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,500
less because you can also do one

834
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,810
thing and if I also change the database

835
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:46,210
of gases that may be worth it I put

836
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:48,340
what is now totally steel,

837
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,820
really

838
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,920
another tool that could auto  curly

839
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,690
and if I don't I get to use my very

840
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:56,150
good friend iago cuts my salt it was a

841
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:58,100
I made a hide is a tool that

842
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,200
this man made that is in all

843
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,700
linux distributions that there are even

844
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,390
in free bs of different distributions

845
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:07,310
that allows you  look for hidden processes

846
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,730
with different sequential bradford techniques

847
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:12,050
well it has a lot of

848
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:14,390
things that from what he has told me

849
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:16,970
a French developer has joined the project

850
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:19,040
who must be a machinist and that

851
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,680
the uncle is a pleasure to see crazy from arba

852
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,350
either another  One of the things that a hi don

853
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,740
height tcp does is look for hidden network connections,

854
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,880
that is, network connections

855
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,590
that the operating system does not show you

856
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,720
but in hyde based on different

857
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,180
techniques that are speaking the pro bar

858
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,760
that is also worth for example and

859
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,350
comparing with  what

860
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:43,120
a testa actually returns says here they have bundled it up with you

861
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:46,640
that in terms of the linux case as I say

862
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,170
I am honest this happened to me

863
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:50,480
it has happened to me and that it was

864
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,790
only that and now e  Now I am going to tell you

865
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:55,400
something that happened to a friend of a

866
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:00,190
friend on an iPhone that also happened to me.

867
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,809


868
00:34:02,809 --> 00:34:07,660


869
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,909


870
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:14,060
Who is here from the 80's

871
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:17,420
are old but well well then I

872
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:21,980
too then this image will

873
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:24,590
sound like a virus that was called and that is from

874
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,210
a malware that existed for iPhone, okay

875
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:27,380
, we will tell you about it

876
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,560
but I will expose the situation

877
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:33,670
another Tuesday at 2  In the morning at that

878
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:36,730
time my colleague iago was sticking

879
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:39,520
with the whatsapp application that he was,

880
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,650
we all use it and

881
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,389
we all have a fear with that tremendous application,

882
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:45,550
very well, because at that

883
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,469
time he said hey I have an android and I am

884
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:50,590
seeing that the database  of whatsapp

885
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,510
is unencrypted from wanda [ __ ] well for

886
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:55,659
your mind to see how it is in mine I am going

887
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:57,910
to connect to my iphone and I look at my

888
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,620
iphone with jailbreak of course because

889
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,870
I like to pay for the applications

890
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:03,430
but also po  I do not jailbreak understand

891
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:07,210
the thing that I do very often,

892
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:10,610
I am going to connect

893
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:14,270
from the web via wireless ok and I say

894
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:17,240
ssh root against this IP network that I had,

895
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,730
my iphone is supposed and it returns this

896
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:22,040
connection close by remote or how strange

897
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,250
Well, here it says that it is raised between

898
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,650
these that we see here I put an enema

899
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:30,380
and port 22 gifts to the pin it responded to

900
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,260
22 no what strange thing I say well

901
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,900
as I have the cydia set here

902
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,550
uninstall the open ssh then

903
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:40,820
install it and reinstall it inside  and

904
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:44,060
I connect via ssh against the

905
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:47,090
iphone itself to a net stat among a thousand other

906
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:49,510
things that I did and I find this

907
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:52,280
as you can

908
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,780
see that at 1 226 is the ip of the iphone

909
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:59,570
from the 110 there is a stable connection to

910
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,580
the correct ssh port it is me  so far

911
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,920
correct but nevertheless you do not see something

912
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,250
strange here

913
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:11,820
you do not see like a weight odometer

914
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:15,150
and that they are all set 140 and 141 52

915
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:17,610
rare true as a gypsy jogging

916
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:20,670
this is not a little suspicious but helmet

917
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:24,240
like the son-in-law d  and my son-in-law of the king of my

918
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,980
country counting living is one thing that

919
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:30,600
this is good then good to

920
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,210
reinstall if I find this I say

921
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:35,760
weird I start to search among various

922
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,820
blogs I did not have tcp of underworld and I start to

923
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,110
search between lexicon fun I find

924
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,240
in forgiveness in  different files and I am

925
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,240
in it ssh points and being a

926
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,940
host it is a file in which when

927
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,070
you connect from that machine against an

928
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:52,080
IP address against another system by ssh there

929
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,170
is a trace, a trace, after all, it is

930
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:57,480
worth that you have  connected to another

931
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,970
machine I see this I say I can swear

932
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,980
that with the guys that is the keyboard the

933
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,350
baton fingers that I have

934
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:06,240
I can not connect to all this from

935
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,920
the iphone is here something there

936
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,020
as I tell you I start to look at the blogs

937
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,060
and  I see

938
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:17,530
in the general point the pop of kernel

939
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:22,360
protection fire and I am looking but

940
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,440
weird weird

941
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:29,380
damn it has happened to me again I

942
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,320
[ __ ] the [ __ ]

943
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,730
and now what do we do

944
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:36,550
good googling I start looking for things

945
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,380
and in the end what of  The iphone I told him there is

946
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,940
something good and I will look at it tomorrow that I

947
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,470
think this is my second problem the

948
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:44,050
first is another right now and I start to

949
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,760
investigate and I start to see that

950
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,410
indeed the diagnosis was very

951
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:50,530
clear the little poch bot program belonged

952
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:54,400
to the virus and  What and this and that this is not

953
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,400
good, it says here how to delete I

954
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,500
did I delete that file the poc of

955
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,450
bot in bar Viennese h pass I do not know what I do

956
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:04,990
not know what more or less you see it and damn

957
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:07,600
what will this be not good because this  They are the

958
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,950
files that have to be deleted and restart

959
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:10,480
what I am going to do is I am going to

960
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,780
copy them I am going to see what the hell they have even

961
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:16,210
later and to clean the iPhone and sanitize it

962
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,740
well but first I am going to see what this does

963
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,830


964
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:21,230
then I start to analyze  each

965
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:24,950
of the files and I see the pelister that

966
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:27,050
was on TV

967
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:29,500
then I find this type of

968
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,480
file is used so that when

969
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,830
iphone ios starts, sorry it interprets

970
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:38,360
this as a service that has to

971
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,490
start, which is what starts bar

972
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:43,460
well bar pop  Devotee is okay,

973
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,260
that is, without more, that is, it is nothing more

974
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,420
malicious than it starts this when the

975
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:50,630
mobile turns it on properly, I am going to look for

976
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,100
the file and I say what type of files

977
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,200
is the top box of the bot and the players are going

978
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,880
to disassemble this  Christ I'm going to

979
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,830
call the pancake here to start

980
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:00,080
looking at what the hell does this good, well,

981
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,610
I'm not going to call the bread now because

982
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:03,080
also in the afternoon, well, I

983
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,480
would be awake and I'm going to do a

984
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,250
string to see what comes out

985
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:10,160
and then it comes out.  a lot of good things

986
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,270
reading about the virus and that what is it

987
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:15,990
is a virus that was developed in

988
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:18,700
Australia and that entered different

989
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,040
mobiles designed for Australian telephony, it is

990
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,620
worth with Australian IP addressing

991
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:27,910
so that what it did

992
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:30,460
was it was connected for that reason sh against

993
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:33,640
various  devices that had the

994
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,740
default password of open ssh

995
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,850
once you have jailbroken it and you are

996
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:40,380
installed on the

997
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,940
iphone, enter that password, it says that

998
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,790
this password to paint, which was the

999
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:49,820
default that  Something copied me first to my

1000
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:53,420
same good typical viral pattern using

1001
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:55,840
in this case

1002
00:39:56,020 --> 00:40:00,160
and I also add a wallpaper a

1003
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,770
jpg image that is set as an

1004
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:05,410
iphone wallpaper that is the damn

1005
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:07,240
rich ashley saying that it will surround you

1006
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,280
very well then that  I am here today

1007
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,280
I am here first is replacement with

1008
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,750
asterisks those rows that I

1009
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,730
liked that it reconsidered relevant ok it

1010
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:19,360
says get and fade from to the drs that is to say give me

1011
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,680
an IP address which is the one of the pp interface

1012
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,140
but which is the public interface that gets

1013
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:29,440
up in the  3g interface of an ios of

1014
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,150
an iphone

1015
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:33,190
then there you see percent percent

1016
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,960
percent and zero point percent s

1017
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,910
percent of that percent and 255 that is,

1018
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:39,190
that is for within a sure force

1019
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:42,400
it is worth and it is general based on what  first

1020
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,270
to the ip address that you have all the

1021
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:49,060
ip addresses that are of that class

1022
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:52,600
c network so it looks good then here are

1023
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,010
happy [ __ ] that we

1024
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:55,630
programmers put when we develop well

1025
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:58,270
there not when i'm no  t want snif

1026
00:40:58,270 --> 00:40:59,610
by until you know the

1027
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:02,710
typical address of Australian networks of

1028
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:06,130
Australian telephony

1029
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,800
then as I say several [ __ ] from passing

1030
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,060
by here passing by there which are the ones that

1031
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,890
I put in print is it is because that these

1032
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:14,860
put other happy things

1033
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:17,020
but we are fundamentally that type of

1034
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:20,110
code  What else do I find? I find

1035
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:24,250
that he makes a call to ssh.

1036
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:26,110


1037
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,790


1038
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:30,730


1039
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:33,090


1040
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,070
of ssh when he is going to

1041
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:36,990
connect to something to match what

1042
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:39,510
he already knew and tells him look at this to

1043
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:43,590
put a 99 to see what happens if the

1044
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:47,640
password is to the country it returns something and if

1045
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,860
it is not the pin it returns something else then

1046
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:52,650
yes  It is to the country I know that I have one,

1047
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:55,680
speak and if not then I follow the

1048
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,830
next host to the country the password and

1049
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:02,150
then you find yourself here that does

1050
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:06,789
a ssh pas and executes ssp that is,

1051
00:42:06,789 --> 00:42:10,609
there are those secure copy, it is worth copying a

1052
00:42:10,609 --> 00:42:13,250
file to the correct host with user

1053
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:14,900
password to which it corresponds

1054
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,180
what is copied in the bar barbara love

1055
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,700
you can't be closer to gap point jpg which

1056
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:22,250
is where it is here right now copy what

1057
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:24,470
to steal mobile library look background

1058
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:26,539
point jpg that is  Set the

1059
00:42:26,539 --> 00:42:29,040
wallpaper well

1060
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,280
and I lost put damn rich I read and more

1061
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:32,910
things

1062
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:35,040
kill delete the ssh file fingers to

1063
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,280
the ssh server of the iphone delete it and kill

1064
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,620
the ssh process that is, that is why I

1065
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,780
could not connect by ssh against the

1066
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,960
device

1067
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:49,130
more things the  delete the lock let's go

1068
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:52,280
current jpg etcetera etcetera etcetera and blue

1069
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,660
lounge of tele loud

1070
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,610
that is to say, it activates as a service that

1071
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:58,610
starts the file with and that vote list

1072
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:00,080
that is to say the one that when the

1073
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:04,970
system starts up the bot poc and I do not know

1074
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:06,470
if it has remained  Sure, but kill a

1075
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:09,570
bloody ssh ok

1076
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:11,720
then

1077
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,910
because this did not affect me I

1078
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:16,220
mean because I did not see the rich law and

1079
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,470
well this only affected

1080
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:20,900
versions of them less than 4 if

1081
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,820
I am not mistaken  I already had four-something

1082
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:25,260
at that time

1083
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:28,350
and of course the file name of the

1084
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:31,470
wallpaper in ios after 4 is

1085
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:33,630
different from that therefore this was

1086
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:36,000
copied there and okay but I did not find

1087
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,320
out I am not going to riccardo myself  I am going to

1088
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,930
another photo on my wallpaper, yes it

1089
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:41,070
is true that the battery lasted less

1090
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:43,860
than that I put in, we will not be now

1091
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:45,120
my head hurts less on which I

1092
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,330
erase this is not a strange thing and yes it

1093
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:50,250
is I realized things  It is worth which

1094
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:52,850
tool you use because in this case

1095
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:55,530
use as cydia had a

1096
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:57,720
tool called sis info plus that only works

1097
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,430
if you have a jailbroken mobile

1098
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:01,500
that is to say that it comes in handy at least

1099
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,690
they leave you something to be able to forensic arlo

1100
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:06,750
later not since  you have it and this is already

1101
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:08,250
once clean, that is, I no longer saw

1102
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:09,750
rare connections, I saw connections that are

1103
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:12,600
supposed to be normal and that I had to

1104
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:16,350
see quite useful, the tool well

1105
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:17,670
allows you to see the established connections,

1106
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:20,130
how is the memory on the disk, I don't know  what I

1107
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:22,250
found also other types of

1108
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:24,330
tools that do it there is a

1109
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:26,970
paid one that allows you to see the

1110
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:28,740
outgoing connections for me it is the most important

1111
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,240
route table connections that is what

1112
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,470
saved me here being

1113
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:33,320
able to say [ __ ] this is really

1114
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:37,300
screwed then

1115
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,880
my conclusions regarding  In this case

1116
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,370
we first eliminate the malware without because it

1117
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:44,110
follows the procedure there and apart from that

1118
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:45,490
I took the whole pile of things to

1119
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:47,590
take a look at it whenever I want the

1120
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:51,130
entry point is detected yes and

1121
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:53,410
you will say hey but your

1122
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:55,480
elite security consultant etc. etc.

1123
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,910
etc.  You are such an [ __ ] so

1124
00:44:57,910 --> 00:44:58,660
you are

1125
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:02,270
to have the default password to the country

1126
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:05,870
because no I did not have it by default but

1127
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,390
looking back when I did

1128
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:09,450
this

1129
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:13,650
this phone I he said the jailbreak one

1130
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:15,119
weekend I was at my

1131
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:19,260
parents' house and  at my parents' house I did not have

1132
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:22,410


1133
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:24,960
wireless internet access at that time so

1134
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,069
I had to jailbreak install a

1135
00:45:28,069 --> 00:45:30,780
den terminal tool  Another of the

1136
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:32,250
iphone itself to be able to change the password

1137
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:35,190
with the double pass changed the password

1138
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:37,140
immediately, which goes from the green one

1139
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:38,309
version to another

1140
00:45:38,309 --> 00:45:40,079
the tool step is to the

1141
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:41,579
terminal tool that I had the

1142
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:43,799
terminal application stopped working and the

1143
00:45:43,799 --> 00:45:46,680
plus starter and  it was going well

1144
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,329
I had to go to the internet to start

1145
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:50,280
looking for another tool, it is so

1146
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,609
good for ios4, it started very well,

1147
00:45:53,609 --> 00:45:54,869
it installed the load, I do not know what

1148
00:45:54,869 --> 00:45:56,849
actually and it takes those

1149
00:45:56,849 --> 00:45:59,190
15 minutes, it may take those 20

1150
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:02,490
at most charger in  those 20 minutes

1151
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:04,289
some mobile that had come from

1152
00:46:04,289 --> 00:46:07,740
Australia or another that was

1153
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:10,109
working from Australia I wrinkled

1154
00:46:10,109 --> 00:46:13,079
found me as an open key to paint

1155
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:16,650
and nailed it to me I finally found the

1156
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:18,380
entry point yes

1157
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:20,300
against measures taken man the

1158
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:21,800
next is that the street the  break if

1159
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,140
I do and shelter the iphone and

1160
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:26,420
lately I no longer do it obviously

1161
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:28,490
I will do it within a reliable network and

1162
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:30,290
not through 3g etc.  Ethereal etcetera

1163
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:32,180
etcetera until we are sure that this

1164
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:34,430
is well done errors learned because

1165
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:37,899
if you do not break the iphone

1166
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:42,430
in terms of good practices to help

1167
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:44,530
for forensic analysis things that

1168
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:46,630
help us to really check if a

1169
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:48,610
system has a bug or has had

1170
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:51,820
a bug  or has suffered an incident, a

1171
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:54,340
compromise, okay, the following things can be worth

1172
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:56,500
first, tools

1173
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,060
that help us to check the integrity

1174
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:00,190
of the files, such as, for example,

1175
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:02,170
there is an otate wire that does this type of

1176
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:03,910
tool the first time when

1177
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:05,590
you start it, it

1178
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:08,050
grabs all the  file system and

1179
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:10,270
generates a hash for each of the

1180
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:13,120
files you have saves a hash in

1181
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:16,420
a database for one part every day

1182
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,940
or every X time it is configurable you

1183
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:21,610
tell it to start it again and check

1184
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:23,950
which files have changed with respect to their

1185
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:27,370
state  Above, that is, if now it has

1186
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:29,230
changed four types of files because

1187
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:31,510
its hash changes, it shows it to me and

1188
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:34,090
sends me an email, that is to say, we  Go to

1189
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:35,830
find out quickly that something has happened and

1190
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:37,930
even if it is historical, it is also

1191
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:39,940
worth checking backwards that

1192
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,370
a file changed on such dates and

1193
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:43,960
especially if we have any suspicions so that

1194
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,270
to see how to check with

1195
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:48,190
other tools with other measures

1196
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:50,530
other  security systems where

1197
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:52,750
we have been able to have

1198
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:56,050
the detailed incident is to say that you do not tell me

1199
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:59,410
that I do not know that you have made an

1200
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:01,240
invalid instruction of I do not know what not that you leave me a

1201
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,250
detail of what has happened is worth to be

1202
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:05,890
able to look at the blogs apart from  Be

1203
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:07,570
detailed that he does not only do them

1204
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:09,700
locally but that he sends them remotely, for

1205
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,670
example through his blog,

1206
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:14,549
a separate machine that centralizes those

1207
00:48:14,549 --> 00:48:18,780
events because because for an

1208
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:20,160
attacker maybe they arrive and compromise the

1209
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,990
machine, they split it in two they erase

1210
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:24,450
everything and you  You forget about the subject, okay, how

1211
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:26,250
do I find something there? How do I know what

1212
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:28,230
steps the attacker has followed? You don't know,

1213
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:29,910
well, you can find out by retrieving

1214
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:31,589
information, but not if  The company is sure

1215
00:48:31,589 --> 00:48:34,020
you can do it so if you send

1216
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:36,240
the logs you have a second copy on a

1217
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,280
remote system and the guy has to be

1218
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,809
very good at deleting those from

1219
00:48:39,809 --> 00:48:41,640
the remote system too, so I'm not saying that

1220
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,290
it can't be done, I say how good it is to

1221
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:45,200
be  It happens not

1222
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,589
ntp network time protocol this was

1223
00:48:48,589 --> 00:48:50,510
discussed with the dark operator with carlos

1224
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,770
pérez I don't know if you know him

1225
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:55,360
precisely about what is important

1226
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,940
when a forensic analysis is done that

1227
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:01,630
all systems have the same time and I don't

1228
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:04,150
even say that it is the good time but I say

1229
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:06,820
that it is  the same because because all

1230
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:08,710
systems are sent when it is by syslog they

1231
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:12,430
send one each event that happens with

1232
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:15,520
their own time so when you

1233
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,720
want to look at something in chronological mode

1234
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,610
you want to do whatever montaigne line

1235
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:20,230
of what the hell has happened with all the

1236
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:22,420
systems that  They interact here on my network

1237
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:24,760
I want to know what happened, you look at it from

1238
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,140
top to bottom, but if something has

1239
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:28,240
different hours, it is okay and they are

1240
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,700
indexed in database n  or they are

1241
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,500
sequential in szyszlo files, even

1242
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,290
if it is a file without

1243
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:36,520
everyone's centralized blog, what feeling do

1244
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,560
the hours change? You have the order of

1245
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:41,410
entry is different, you get lost,

1246
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:42,970
then it is much better that at least it

1247
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:44,680
has the same time, there is a

1248
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:45,940
protocol called  net ep that if all the

1249
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:47,950
machines comply with it, well,

1250
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:49,690
because we can know what happened to

1251
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:52,530
now we will know at what time they stole

1252
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:54,690
from us deployment of types of ideas is from

1253
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:56,700
ips tools that help us

1254
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:59,610
to analyze in a moment how much it

1255
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:00,990
is to be able to find out  that something has happened

1256
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:03,240
that something is happening or that something is

1257
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,920
blocking ok then the friend behind the

1258
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,180
web will tell us the best things about these

1259
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:09,680
and constant monitoring and

1260
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,270
notification to the right people

1261
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:12,770
well here so far he has told

1262
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:15,559
things that help the good  but and that

1263
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:17,390
helps the bad guys to skip states

1264
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:20,240
to the little anti forensics also that is to

1265
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,099
say there is someone here who is from the

1266
00:50:22,099 --> 00:50:24,410
carabineros somebody  In customs someone

1267
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:25,700
who is not going to let me leave the country

1268
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:28,210
this Saturday

1269
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,490
what do we have to do to

1270
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:35,859
leave to do things to do

1271
00:50:35,859 --> 00:50:38,290
evil safely do not do this at

1272
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:41,290
home but hey first everything we

1273
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:43,900
have with encryption later  There has

1274
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:45,160
been a lot of talk about the

1275
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,500
encryption systems for example of true crime that if it

1276
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,750
is from the n it is that if file volt reaches

1277
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:51,010
the need it asks for it but hey look

1278
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:53,410
I want you to get the password of

1279
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:55,540
this this entire container because  I don't know

1280
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:57,640
what the hell here but I'm interested in anyway

1281
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,050
you can use several I don't care to

1282
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:01,619
use encryption systems use the

1283
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:04,330
own one that linux brings the lux I do not know how to

1284
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:05,770
use different encryption systems

1285
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:07,960
whatever you want done there is a story of

1286
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,330
a Romanian I do not remember  Romanian lulzsec,

1287
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:12,430
if I'm not mistaken, it said that

1288
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:15,160
an encrypted filesystem that

1289
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,800
the Roman police had had not been able to

1290
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,570
remove it, so it was true crime,

1291
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:21,849
that is, or they did not throw the n, or I don't know,

1292
00:51:21,849 --> 00:51:24,160
but i  It is important to encrypt everything

1293
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,730
where you have diabolical sandboxing tools,

1294
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:30,700
that is, do not do it from

1295
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:33,640
your ppc directly, that is, or yes,

1296
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,619
but maybe build a virtual machine

1297
00:51:35,619 --> 00:51:37,990
with a line system or have one

1298
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:40,960
installed but something that you can delete in

1299
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,070
a safe way and not here  Nothing has happened is

1300
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:44,770
worth it because it is also something that can

1301
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:47,910
be interesting to say to virtualize

1302
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:50,430
using an external wifi card, do not

1303
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:52,740
use your own because because it

1304
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:55,060
blames your own mac address

1305
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:57,210
then using an external wifi card

1306
00:51:57,210 --> 00:52:00,520
that you can also change

1307
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,980
the mac address up to  A random one,

1308
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:05,050
well I remember years ago that on a

1309
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:07,300
laptop that I had every day I had one

1310
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:08,470
because it generated a more

1311
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:10,210
random address and raised the interface like this, that

1312
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,070
is, but we are going to work, do not

1313
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:13,940
believe it, it

1314
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:17,349
is a little paranoid

1315
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:21,130
as I say an external wifi card something

1316
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:22,570
that you can throw the garbage out the

1317
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:24,370
window through the toilet and you have the

1318
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:26,920
chain you ate it, I don't care

1319
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,280
alea  toria to

1320
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,890
use a browser and an extension

1321
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:33,080
for example like me would be a switcher for

1322
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,330
firefox that allows you to change the judge

1323
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:38,090
jenn do not leave traces of what you have

1324
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:40,900
in your particular navigation because some

1325
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:43,430
time ago in writing a post it was

1326
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:46,400
covered by failure that there was a project that

1327
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,950
I tried to identify or

1328
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:50,840
fingerprint each user by the amount of

1329
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,150
[ __ ] that he has installed on a pc

1330
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:55,700
and that goes inside liu sereim, it really

1331
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,770
was to lower them with penalties the combinations

1332
00:52:57,770 --> 00:53:00,770
and it is not directly incriminating

1333
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:02,120
because damn it shows that there is no

1334
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,500
other guy  It does not have all that there will be

1335
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,720
thousands already but it is that here it is that

1336
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,010
more things are incriminated here, that is, it

1337
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:11,050
is shown not then to avoid that

1338
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:15,119
by shooting use

1339
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:17,680
external free wireless networks such as those

1340
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,320
of starbucks for example but make a

1341
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,840
little peace  You don't pay with cash with your

1342
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,880
credit card because if you

1343
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,430
load from there you paid for the coffee with

1344
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:28,420
your credit card and it says that

1345
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:30,550
You were there, that is, do not do it like this,

1346
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:31,990
make save aydin do what you want

1347
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:35,740
and they did not change put on a wig, lose

1348
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:38,669
20 kilos,

1349
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:43,330
use a vpn to a country without laws of

1350
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:44,830
those that say that they do not keep logs of

1351
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:47,640
those that I do not know about pirate bay for example

1352
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:51,400
something that allows you to encapsulate all the

1353
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,990
traffic that you take out through an

1354
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:55,330
IP of go you who knows where encrypted

1355
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:57,160
to the other side and that does not leave logs that

1356
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,890
the IP cakes is from Malawi because it

1357
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:02,050
is bad water and I do not care if it returned that they

1358
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:04,660
go  to malawi to find me not to use

1359
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:07,960
all or anonymous proxies well well but

1360
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,730
not directly but

1361
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:12,190
also through a vpn and this is curling the

1362
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:15,480
curl by twisting the nut a lot

1363
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:19,320
if you like this type of challenge or this

1364
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:21,900
type of reading things that have  In the past

1365
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,940
I had a [ __ ] time with these two

1366
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:26,220
books my friend recommended them and I

1367
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:28,740
have put a link here in shortened mode

1368
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:30,240
in case you want to take pictures of

1369
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,090
anything,

1370
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:34,490
even to a post of criticism of folk

1371
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:37,220
where I recommended it, these have  more  It's been years

1372
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:40,520
since the black thread but I tell you it's on

1373
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,230
a pool weekend and the two of

1374
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:44,930
them returned Monday to iago and told me what

1375
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:46,280
happens that you have not liked and well what

1376
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,050
we have already aired, one used

1377
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:49,700
and the other  on Sunday and good measure to them and

1378
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:52,130
if he is telling you in the first part

1379
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:54,770
of the book 20 cases with things that have

1380
00:54:54,770 --> 00:54:57,140
happened and in the second part how it is

1381
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:58,670
solved in those cases is a little

1382
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:01,160
novels by Agatha Christie or novels a

1383
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,260
little mystery  But oriented to the

1384
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:05,300
IT line, well this talk has

1385
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:07,520
so far gone from fails, truth about things,

1386
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,730
because you [ __ ] what it demands today or not

1387
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:12,140
at the end of the day with the ones that are going to happen to

1388
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:15,170
me I want to dismiss the talk simply

1389
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:17,480
with a video that is that  It seems like a

1390
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,070
film to me but tremendous I do not know if you have

1391
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:23,030
seen it, this is really worth it because you

1392
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:24,140
have heard us talk about trust therapies as a

1393
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:25,940
couple and so that you do not have

1394
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:27,620
to fall on top of your partner and

1395
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:29,480
you will see that she will pick you up either

1396
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,770
so that you trust your partner more

1397
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:39,849
t  ranquila I'm going to give you things

1399

fail

1400
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:50,500
and well this end and I don't know if you have

1401
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,480
any questions, any doubts, do you want to

1402
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,610
throw tomatoes or something at me

1403
00:55:53,610 --> 00:56:04,260
[Applause]

1404
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:08,190
I don't see anything since 6 doubts make me rich

1405
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:10,460
now, yes,

1406
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:19,660
any questions, if anything.

1407
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:21,650
Ask Lorenzo

1408
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:23,809
about forensics and it is my phone to the girl, they

1409
00:56:23,809 --> 00:56:26,359
are the ones from then the loss and you end up

1410
00:56:26,359 --> 00:56:28,960
claudio to

1411
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:30,890
a question for a comment that

1412
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:33,920
arose here in the linux attack when you

1413
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,960
addressed us, you told us that you had

1414
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:38,240
from the gps issue to notify the

1415
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,160
location  of your car now that

1416
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,690
you are commenting on what your wife put in

1417
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:45,380
to detect what it is like, well

1418
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:46,850
maybe I put it in the car

1419
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:49,569
she from behind

1420
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:54,730
and some other question not good

1421
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:56,340
