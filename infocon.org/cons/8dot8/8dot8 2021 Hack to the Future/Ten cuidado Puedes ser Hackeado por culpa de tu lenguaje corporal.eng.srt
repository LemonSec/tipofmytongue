1
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,790
Social engineering is a very good talk, please pay close attention and I assure you

2
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:50,920
that after the talk you will behave differently, I leave you with Hugo Bayón, welcome,

3
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:04,390
well, all the changes, then and especially everyone here has come

4
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:12,070
and they are speakers if you he hears about them and they have blogs and the people from here know me

5
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,270
languages ​​and nervous re nervous and as I said to my colleagues I always do

6
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:26,000
something stupid before starting to say that I am nervous so what I

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,780
want to try this time is that all of applause but strong strong but

8
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:36,980
the incentive is the following this is social engineering here in computers but directly

9
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:42,380
with the person and there is someone that I need to make a fool of myself at one point of the talk

10
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:50,399
so who applauds is the one who is going to pass ready then and with you I hugo to cry

11
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:14,840
the truth number I was hoping well my name is your ball I coach I am not intelligent either but I

12
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:21,790
treat people in a very particular way I appreciate it ndí because the first one I was very clumsy

13
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:30,820
my loves Sean Payton more weeks are always read I never understood but still I know that well

14
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:38,820
then I decided to dedicate myself to what social engineering and it is a social life both improved

15
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:47,980
how to get to systems that do not it was possible for me to compromise them when we say we have a good

16
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:55,459
garden there would be a person who knew well what he was doing but that person knows well what he is doing

17
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,149
on the computer but that person alone is very vulnerable

18
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:07,150
so let's start what I want here is that all of you have an introduction to what

19
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:11,650
social engineering and know more or less what they have to study to be able to go fried

20
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:19,360
the definition is simple is any act of influence is a person to take an action that

21
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,340
may or may not be pre his best interest then they will tell social engineering for scammers

22
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:34,030
and all those non-rights when a child is hungry a baby cries and the father immediately

23
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:39,670
we will bring him a bed and dance warm the milk and the important thing is the busy something that person made a

24
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:46,119
decision for a behavior the child cried the annoyances until the personalized one I have to go

25
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:54,210
his children when they tell them I am going to leave that he can not leave but

26
00:03:54,210 --> 00:04:01,920
that is engineering to teach more basic and We all use it daily,

27
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:10,590
the first thing we are going to see is that it is communication, so there is a model

28
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,150
called the model, see it, there are other models but it is the one that has found that it has served me in

29
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,890
real life. To say here is because it has been tested in real life and it works,

30
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:30,940
we start there is a source that the person or what you are going to communicate is doing, I

31
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:36,730
do not then come the message how we are going to communicate what is what I want to transmit

32
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:46,380
a channel to transmit a message we have several channels the voice in this case but we also have

33
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:57,659
letters in email modes we have text messages we have whatsapp good you know horrible we had

34
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:06,660
the month that made us had one to be concise quick take off the thermals to receive it later

35
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:15,070
by massa we have an audience because it is free what does that mean hello how

36
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:18,940
are you fine what are you doing not now it is not raining

37
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,790
fall

38
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,330
how did you make an application

39
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:37,169
ok we have this problem

40
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:45,690
a source a message from a channel now the receiver who is it the receiver the person who is

41
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:53,040
going to receive and is going to interpret that message what is happening in this piece we have noise that

42
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:59,070
is that noise how many since sending an email and then in their head they say it super

43
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:04,500
friendly they write it super friendly in a friendly tone and when another person arrives they answer them with a

44
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:10,590
rivlin aggressiveness or is it that where did you offend ncl in that mail jones and keith and they get angry and

45
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:18,539
that's why we make noise because we are removing a bit of variables from the middle of the

46
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:25,320
message And then we have a pipe that is the feedback that we are going to interpret because

47
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:30,690
the other person really received with respect to what we wanted us to receive as

48
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:36,120
engineers social what we are going to do is [__] this model and do it the other way

49
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:42,270
around first, how do you want the person to respond then I want the person to do so many things then

50
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:51,240
we define someone where I am going to transmit what is the best way to transmit it exactly

51
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:57,150
as I'm going to take it and if the source is going to be done, I need the source to be external,

52
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:09,020
ok, we are going to incorporate it, it is all more complicated for many of you and it is because we interpret

53
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:14,030
the systems very well, we can read code as much as you want and people can read it.

54
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:19,280
you will understand and a person can pay here and explain a tool about code whatever

55
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,900
it is and you will understand it but when you are face to face with the person you do not

56
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:29,210
speak to him as the code would tell him then we will go over the top to deal with From reading them

57
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:37,680
here we are only going to focus on two things, which is comfort and discomfort, which is the same,

58
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,170
we are interested in working when a person works when we are going to obtain information from him

59
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:52,520
or her. we are looking for access to a specific place look at the mouth here relaxed the lips a look

60
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:59,450
that here in this bit serve as in conversing joy in the eyes as some

61
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:08,530
say there is that person is relaxed is happy look here these pieces see how they arrogate a

62
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:15,140
That person is telling us a little there, that person is happy instead, look at the discomfort,

63
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:22,310
look at the position of the eyebrows with respect to the prisons, if you see how it has lowered a little,

64
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:29,810
the women express the discomfort by covering you,

65
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:39,659
then if you arrive at your house and see that his wife is here every time you see him

66
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:50,839
in trouble the male version is that we have to catch ourselves with lula but in

67
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:56,130
many of the people where they are stressed in their offices, men do this when

68
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,980
you are talking to a person and that person in middle of the conversation

69
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,120
and in several signs and within those that are there is that

70
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:15,280
then when you do this the person is uncomfortable ready more inside the

71
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,699
why but look at the difference is what we have to express

72
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:26,480
to identify when a person is as always I have to use I feel comfortable

73
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,940
with me not many times what we are going to do is precisely the opposite that that thing

74
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,830
feels uncomfortable and so uncomfortable that You have to do what I want him to do in a

75
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:44,410
shorter time so if I do this he got it off me quickly then we are going to lower that in

76
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:48,850
others when we want to have more permanence we are going to need the comfort of the person

77
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:55,780
a sign of comfort What women have is when they take off

78
00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:00,220
their shoes when you are in a woman who starts to play with her heels and takes

79
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:06,530
them off or puts her shoes aside is a very great sign of comfort yes

80
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:16,060
then when you see this you have gained a lot It is part of the trust of the person because

81
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:21,849
because we were taught to lie from a young age, it is true that here he has never lied,

82
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,130
too, that is

83
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,970
what people feel and then we s We understand we started to lie

84
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:37,980
with our faces because yellow is not that lying people look at

85
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,850
us as a result they told us as a child that a lying person is going to maintain

86
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:48,840
eye contact for longer but also to avoid

87
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:54,210
that because we learn to lie with their eyes and then If we were nervous, well, he had better

88
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:59,400
here when he was a drunkard, he does not stand in front of the mirror and that is why he saw,

89
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:10,610
we learn to lie with our faces and then we learn to lie with our hands, we hide them but it becomes

90
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:18,170
more difficult because once people tremble that people rub themselves then we begin

91
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:23,420
to have difficulties to lie with our hands but that we do so when we are tired

92
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:27,740
or in pain we tend to walk sometimes more in a row to lie with the rest of our

93
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:36,850
body but nobody or almost nobody about the people who study this I am not very sincere to learn to

94
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:43,470
lie with those who are nobody because we forget the risks we are not lying so many

95
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:51,120
times one sees a group of people and one of those people has a foot pointing towards the exit

96
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:57,730
when one sees that it is a group that is to say that that person is not so interested in what they are talking about

97
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:03,440
and is unconsciously looking for the exit when a person has a very

98
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:13,460
large community of Rogues aside and it is at the age where they listened and the truth is that the talk and everything

99
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:19,620
above it here is going to focus me a lot on body language before you try to

100
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:25,230
read because any of these things have to generate a baseline of behavior

101
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:32,010
That baseline will allow is when it is normal for a person to do this if it is a

102
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:38,250
person who since childhood has been taught to take off his shoes everywhere you can not

103
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:43,720
interpret that as a sign of comfort because it is normal behavior of a person

104
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,270
a sign that we have been taught that a person does not care what

105
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,980
we are talking about is when he crosses his arms

106
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,830
how many of you over all men feel comfortable standing talking to another man

107
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:07,890
like that, a lot of truth we feel comfortable so you need a baseline of behavior and that

108
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:12,870
baseline what we are going to look for are changes in behavior if a person never

109
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:18,130
crosses his arms and we are talking if he crosses we can begin to interpret

110
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:26,470
body language when one person is taking care of another and this is going to be

111
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,350
this person has can you see that his body is a

112
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:41,870
box has an invisible house when I reach zero well right now

113
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,120
on a deadline

114
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:57,210
ok me I have the victim

115
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:07,780
if I get to this person and talk to him like this, what I am doing is that with my body

116
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:13,839
I am locking myself in an invisible drawer if you see how it was totally encompassing

117
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:21,300
what happens when you go to a person and say there is a quick question always

118
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:27,790
as it was asking hours it feels uncomfortable it feels uncomfortable because I am telling you

119
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:40,350
yes yes what I am doing is blocking that person I am blocking completely and what he is

120
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:45,720
probably going to say is very long is it will take time and he will remove it instead

121
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:51,180
if I arrive and from a person excuse a question anger I feel anger because

122
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:56,699
I am going to go right here look where my feet are pointing that exit not towards him

123
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:04,860
then they follow the body language if we do it consciously we can first make him

124
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:09,540
feel more comfortable to enter slowly what we are going to do is climb

125
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,740
and we are going to talk about it with the person no longer if thanks for this information we get

126
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:19,160
apologies and that slowly hitting these two probably people already

127
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,360
carry much living as both are enclosing can be together cuffed

128
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:32,440
the state a little bit has a smile a little sincere and she is not here

129
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,310
I can tell you what the difference between a real smile and not

130
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:48,180
one way spirit exactly why

131
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:56,680
right now I always look to have front

132
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,240
said

133
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:11,320
the public is is not true if you come here have the outline of the eyes to

134
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,520
see this p I do not know if it looks good

135
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:19,200
wrinkles this part when a smile is totally sincere

136
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:27,420
in it you see the smile but here in this part of the eyes it is totally flat

137
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:38,069
that is a false smile when you are because you smile yes it is false it is not sincere it is not real

138
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:44,520
however she is giving him her full attention something different and exactly different when

139
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:49,620
the fighting forces look at how her shoulders are pointing totally the other

140
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:57,510
way and he is trying to bring his personal circle If you see how his shoulders try to

141
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:04,200
develop that imaginary box, close it, but she does not want the audi, look at the eyes, the

142
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:11,500
look of going towards her, but she is directed the other way, and that comforts and comfort

143
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:17,030
we have when you have

144
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:26,790
good the charismatic or not, yes true and when you have heard about this very different equality it

145
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:33,940
is true that is to say the technical level we are not going to discuss it wozniak

146
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,840
but look at the body language

147
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:46,240
that is exposing its dolls what happens if someone cuts their wrists

148
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:51,830
is vulnerable if we see it from the biological point of view it is easier to understand

149
00:17:51,830 --> 00:18:01,970
is what he is saying is to all of you I fully welcome and expose your veins expose

150
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:11,360
instead if you see the Bosnian language because it responds and that makes it less charismatic that is why

151
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:18,520
there is the same branch, the discomfort we will see that is called there is blogging or eye blocking

152
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:26,270
when a person does this, it is because he does not want to see what he has when rendering when we have

153
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:31,730
problems what we do not want to see is a specific situation something that we are giving us a

154
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:37,190
fight a report that we have to deliver we do this because you can know that how horrible it

155
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:43,310
still makes it unblock my view regarding that this is another sign of very extreme discomfort

156
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:54,080
ok here we already have one of the most interesting things and it is something that first

157
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:01,830
differentiates us from ourselves from those of our monkeys that

158
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:12,670
this makes us powerful this makes us very powerful because we have thumbs and they oppose

159
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:19,770
and we can grab things when a person exposes their thumbs with a person talks and

160
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:24,900
much squeezing their thumbs giving them up the person is showing superiority

161
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:33,420
when a person sits like this stands thus exposing their thumbs is a person

162
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:39,960
who he commands or who sees that he commands but there is an exception to that rule and the only exception

163
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:49,320
is called dental framing or genital framing and it is when we hide our thumbs and walk to teach

164
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:58,480
I personally feel very uncomfortable when another man is talking to me and you do

165
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:06,190
but unconsciously because because that is all I was showing I am the alpha male,

166
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:14,090
men do it a lot when we are talking to a woman the problem is a lot but it is

167
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:19,860
another topic and it is a topic that I started, probably the twitter is going to reach me I wonder why

168
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:28,830
with this security then well the first he is closing and the second they are marking it

169
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:37,770
on the other hand look here this the person wants zoom in look that she is not moving her lucid body

170
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:43,050
language is leaning a little forward she probably knows herself later she has a

171
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:48,330
long conversation at that moment but here this person is approaching her and look at how

172
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:56,129
the body is totally moving away from that person look at the face and how the eyebrows wrinkle the attention

173
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:06,500
on the face and look how the whole cheek wrinkles that expression is a mix between disgust and terror

174
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:15,860
and it is very hard when one reads a woman it is not so good

175
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:25,770
ok now we have it is the neck look these two people look at the girl in particular

176
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:37,830
is here in our neck that the students come if I have cut my jugular alive it is not

177
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:45,140
something that nature has taught us to hide one of the most impressive things and I

178
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:51,710
found myself when I was studying this It is when you fall is the first thing that you do not place your

179
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:59,060
arms true because because nature taught us that if we lose an arm or a leg we are not

180
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:04,700
necessarily going to die then It is the body what it does is give up the less important part

181
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:11,080
of its body that is why we react like this so we do not put our heads in what we do our

182
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,790
impression is immediately that we lose the less important members of our body

183
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:25,840
that is why we do not expose the neck a lot if they see many of the tribes that still live

184
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:32,409
in the savages they usually when they are going to face something dangerous they raise their

185
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:39,890
shoulders a little, hiding precisely the jugular this girl has total confidence about it so she

186
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:47,050
exposes her jugular even leaving the teeth be close to the neck and look at the sign of

187
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:53,740
peace that she has that is very comfortable if you manage to get a person to expose the neck they

188
00:22:55,770 --> 00:23:02,760
have confidence but if I want to generate confidence in someone I expose the neck also

189
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:08,240
while we speak then now yes and now no do what many did and

190
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:14,790
what the Manizales air currents did who wanted [__] the trust of the grapes and

191
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:25,040
and this s they are subtle signs the discomfort is going to be exactly the opposite we are going to

192
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:29,060
hide our veins our important and vital parts

193
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:39,120
we are going to watch a video and why it is not because it has nothing to say and to fill in the time

194
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:47,080
but rather the difference between interpreting from photos and interpreting in videos is in the

195
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,939
videos we have a background of everything that has happened before and why the person is

196
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:57,310
reacting like this instead in photos you do not know what is happening there are people who make the

197
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:03,370
mistake of studying body language with photos of models models are people who

198
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:09,520
advise them and tell them how to stand and sit turn not rotate then it

199
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,650
is not a correct way to study body language will find many courses that

200
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,830
those who seek to make banks after many courses with photos but really

201
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:28,159
they I recommend that they do it with people or study videos but photos not so much they

202
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,600
want to upload the videos

203
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:45,020
maybe

204
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:57,910
making fun of people I think the reaction is coming of the person

205
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:10,920
the first of the upper thumbs and to hide the thumbs that is I feel

206
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:18,710
below the other person where the thumb of that person is, it is better to hide

207
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,960
that he is covering himself

208
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:33,100
are he hides his hands

209
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:41,320
one of the things we do when We are nervous and many of the things that they gave me

210
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:48,570
here I have a lot this morning when I am nervous in 3d something shot of what we call

211
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:56,010
manipulators what do I do I have too many hands what is this think what another person

212
00:25:56,010 --> 00:26:03,030
was next to me and I was doing this to myself, it is calming down but I have no one and

213
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:12,570
internal peace, so what do I do? I start to realize the same thing this person who is already doing

214
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:22,760
this person what he is doing is the same I come he

215
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,870
starts to sweat his head scratching what he is doing is precisely

216
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:33,830
that calm down now I'm going to take the photo and the offering in the next

217
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:52,230
look at the mouth see how it begins to tighten and the eyebrows come as they immediately lower

218
00:26:52,230 --> 00:27:00,930
a little is a signal that mix The insecurity with a little aggressiveness but it is very little

219
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:16,280
he is about to do it but he is making his lips tighten and they are

220
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:23,540
turning inward when we do this when we have something to say but we cannot say it or

221
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:29,159
our fault that the first thing that we generate from childhood educates us in

222
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:35,220
guilt they do not let him probably he wants to refuse to tell him everything in the world but

223
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:41,520
he cannot or should not according to him and that is why he generates the pressure on him, you know

224
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:49,270
even though a mythical woman told him simply beautiful

225
00:27:54,860 --> 00:28:00,889
ah I leave them homework to interpret

226
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:16,250
ok another thing we have are the microexpressions when a show called

227
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:29,330
did the clue they know who advises that series doctor paul ekman seen the series is not one hundred

228
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:36,649
percent dedicated it is not 90 of the central spout nor 70 but is advised by the problem doctor

229
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:42,860
Dr. Paul Ekman is the greatest scholar the psychiatrist expert in micro expressions the micro expressions

230
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:51,110
last a 25 aug second and are very r fast very fast but they express emotions

231
00:28:52,550 --> 00:29:00,460
these are the basic ones what is going to be studied in the micro expressions is this when

232
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:08,200
the lips are raised when the frown wrinkles look at what the smile was saying see joy

233
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:13,340
contempt contempt is the only micro expression we are going to To see

234
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:20,449
that it is irregular and it means that the two parts of the face do not express it but one

235
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:31,240
but then to one side only anger is the only one we see how the eyebrows go down how they tighten the

236
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:41,110
space they inhabit true if the flood gains what it needs from anger the surprise this time we are

237
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:48,010
going to deal with it right now comes the sadness how the forehead works the eyes look drooping

238
00:29:50,560 --> 00:30:00,360
the mouth the fear of the eyes one thing one of the experiments I did to see the

239
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:09,560
microexpressions were mainly two 1 where I put to see the most tense parts in parts

240
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:15,200
before the horror movies and placed the person and what was seen the most was fear

241
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:23,610
but when they tried to feign fear many of these parts around Under the eyes it was very

242
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:31,199
complex to imitate them, so in my way of seeing the microexpressions if they work, there are studies

243
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:37,500
of people who say that the microexpressions do not work what I was talking about the one in the series

244
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:43,380
is the doctor is more the advisor and on the blog of paul ekman there is a chapter by chapter analysis

245
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:48,330
where they are going to tell you that it really can be done that I really don't know today it is not done

246
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:55,050
because if they are going to be guided by that series it doesn't seem right to me but they have the doctor's guide

247
00:30:55,050 --> 00:31:02,280
ayman so that they know that if it is real and that it is not real another film that I recommend that you see

248
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:09,510
that was also advised by the magnet doctor is the intensely someone who saw it they saw the

249
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:15,960
concepts how they were explained in a simple way those concepts are real between psychological concepts and

250
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,340
are advised by the highly recommended for life to understand how the head works

251
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:27,390
because he did not explain the expressions here because we would do a lot and we are going to really see how

252
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:32,730
fast and Yes and make you understand in such a short time it would be very complicated

253
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:59,750
with and the works to the boats

254
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:05,710
oops

255
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,750
but the kuwait sex

256
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,980
more

257
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:21,870
edwards yesterday to be voyeur

258
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:28,480
to reform

259
00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:03,110
and I honestly when of you managed to see some of the micro expressions

260
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:11,550
quite fast of pig not It is to sell but for you to learn, Dr. Hernán has

261
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:17,190
a specific program that will teach you to read them and yes, despite how simple the program

262
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:22,470
seems, really after a while you start watching and it starts, as it were, like on

263
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:27,300
camera slow and learn when people are making certain micro- expressions

264
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,490
and when not ok remember that surprise spoke to them when we grow up they teach us that

265
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:42,280
being exaggerated being genuine is bad because they tell us you have to behave like this like this like this

266
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:49,330
and surprise at the end when We grow in a moment the person is surprised and already

267
00:33:50,550 --> 00:34:00,240
but after the surprise comes the happiness of amazement and in babies they will see total sincerity

268
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,160
and that will help you to climb while learning to read body language

269
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:27,449
those reactions are totally sincere they are thick if you scale that down

270
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:34,560
towards a reaction of maximum one second so you can see the surprise in a person if you have

271
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:42,870
a party they say The person's surprise is going to be the same, so when they see babies if they know

272
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:48,449
the parents who must be staring at them if they don't look at us, the end is not coming,

273
00:34:54,540 --> 00:35:02,970
ok let's focus on what I know about body language, the first thing we are going to do is evaluate to the

274
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:08,100
person to see what his line is going to be what his normal behavior is after knowing that it is

275
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:13,830
normal for that person we will see under stress what changes he has we can produce stressful situations

276
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:20,279
without one being compromised we can see when an imaginary person One thing that I

277
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,840
like to do a lot when I talk to people and people do not realize it is to force them to

278
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:33,470
imagine something then, for example, how do you like some v Acaciones then the

279
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:40,160
people and then what happens I already know that this is the expression to imagine when I ask

280
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,839
a person when I realize that something disgusts him I ask him for something more disgusting

281
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:52,280
and he verified if that is his expression of disgust and so on. he is building a base on that person but

282
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:59,300
then what are the mistakes of the beginner we find out what the person feels but not

283
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:06,640
why you go and then you are going to come in and shout not what I told you and you

284
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:16,850
are the worst with me and not suddenly if they are pants is uncomfortable but it is not because of you a person who

285
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:23,360
keeps it like this you say no what happens no no you are not receptive to me what if I have more

286
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:30,770
pain in the armpits does one of the mistakes that happen really happens One commits that is to say that such a person

287
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:38,090
dislikes you as you know that you do not resemble the ex-boyfriend of three years ago, the simple thing

288
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:43,710
is that we a person resemble someone else our services jump and it makes

289
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:47,670
our body language s It is affected so we know that that person is uncomfortable what

290
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:52,350
we can do is accept their reality and make them start to feel more comfortable with us

291
00:36:53,740 --> 00:37:00,790
ready now close your mouth do not tell people that you are studying body language

292
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:06,990
because why not They invite beer I say why because they did not have an order to speak they

293
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:13,529
do not have conversations the reaction tive because people begin to hide I see people how

294
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:20,400
they approach before the talk and they are normal they ignore me they do not know me and after this

295
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:38,350
do not say it do not rush not from a reading before the golden rule the cluster needs

296
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:48,650
four clues what does discomfort mean one we do not say that a person is in a coma no

297
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:57,770
2 although he did this he did this he turned to the door when he accumulates four when I am

298
00:37:57,770 --> 00:38:05,120
just starting to need four clues that tell me that person is expressing discomfort or

299
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:14,830
comfort not from before there is that you are no 4 after a time of a year and a half

300
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:20,799
with three or two they will achieve it but before they will not make you they will leave the people

301
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:26,170
in their life because there is nothing more horrible than not knowing that another person can read one

302
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:35,350
the other pass dissimulate dissimulation please this a

303
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:39,610
lot People who start and are useful to link people

304
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:51,569
or disguise will do the same thing look at groups look at interaction between other people evaluate but from a

305
00:38:51,570 --> 00:39:01,330
distance do not do it directly and finally culture is important because if you come

306
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:10,460
here I come from hot land of the People analysis all the time but they do not come here and it is

307
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:18,490
cold it is obvious that people are not going to walk so loose because our body tends to want to

308
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:28,890
keep warm when one of the people in other countries in countries like the United States as soon as they express themselves

309
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:38,040
look here at the magazine we are going to steal a little true

310
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:48,140
when a person expresses disgust towards something like that

311
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:57,220
but in our cultures they can change if I do it that restricting from enjoying

312
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:05,740
but I don't disgust anything of the cul ture is important when you see people who have

313
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:09,160
seen people who are talking to them and they put their glasses up so

314
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:16,810
that is subconscious working in the morning we know what it means

315
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:22,600
and there are people who are talking to you and suddenly they really do you like that or they

316
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:27,460
scratch their heads like that and no no no Spain is the subconscious one knows what that means so

317
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:33,370
when one goes from another person let's say I don't remember there is a country where I think one of

318
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:41,859
these two is a false one if you do it and I think that France, that is, 2 a person like that, culture

319
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:47,200
is important that you are going to read someone to know where they come from and what their customs are,

320
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:56,590
ok, let's move on to another topic and she is a friend to whom, man, not the flow,

321
00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:03,500
broadly speaking, what we are going to to do is to force the brain to cause a response

322
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:10,190
when it should not respond so we have emotions feelings and logic

323
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:25,380
love emotions feelings well well no it is not emotion love is a result

324
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:32,070
a mixture of all of many things as we feel happy we feel the public

325
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:41,049
but it is a feeling we have the emotion that is interpreted it becomes a feeling and then

326
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:47,540
logic tells us how to act true when one stops anger at someone it is not that that person

327
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:53,150
falls, stumbles and breaks the nose then well the feeling of joy but logic tells us

328
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:02,750
the truth and some emotions are capable of reducing the brain's ability to

329
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:12,200
process it is like what wealth, why because if someone tells us

330
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:21,180
good, I need that goal state and look print the curriculum it has to be the favor

331
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:30,189
not true it is me from you good excuse for the previous program i ask ford the ford

332
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:34,090
print my resume i have the last job interview today

333
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,740
and this is social engineering

334
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:48,220
we are going to do a test but for what do the test what I want you to see that if it

335
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:55,330
works we can force the amygdala interpret before everything I do not need that it

336
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:59,560
was the test without cheating simply entity to show you that the brain if I can make

337
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:08,290
ground for nothing then this is called the stroke effect comes from here you know it

338
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:20,680
ok then say the color but do not tell only the color of the word did 1 2 3

339
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:38,810
this they already realized that no

340
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:44,609
what is most interesting about this

341
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:55,220
many attacks you have basic engineering studies all and how many chicaneros masters

342
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:04,779
and doctorates and that and all these people and super is intelligent true but who do you

343
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:16,490
think such a child after year and a half because we can beat because the child knows the colors but does not

344
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:25,279
know then the one who is going to see only the colors what I am sending is precisely I take that

345
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:32,720
piece of code that has a very large memory space and I am injecting a

346
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:43,830
low cristian brainware instruction here is very good for Christian and social social engineering in the dr

347
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:52,130
now we are going to get closer to the goal seen as getting closer to the goal we already

348
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:57,560
know who the person is we know how to read them we know how to tell them that how

349
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:03,170
we give encouragement but we need to be close to that person so there is

350
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:07,640
something called fashion liz I don't know how to say it in Spanish and he won't find

351
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:14,180
there is a paper from a Spanish psychologist but he says litis fashion so what are those

352
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:22,870
and it could be this smile and make simple eye contact is true

353
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:30,650
to face the other person raise your voice touch the person to

354
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:36,440
talk about the other person refer to them raise an eyebrow fill an eye

355
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:45,549
and shake hands because everything that happens to them like this as alice enabled to mark

356
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:53,470
we are going to do hypocritically sincere what does this mean we are going to learn to pretend sincerity

357
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:03,920
we have a big division and it is sadness that will generate empathy and it will serve for

358
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:09,380
quick and reactive attacks the example I gave them now I need you to insert into the usb and

359
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:15,860
double click on a word with a ridiculously large macro because it made the big resume

360
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:23,000
but what does that give us if I arrive? I'm sad that the space you have I am meeting a friend

361
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:29,240
from a long time ago and that person tells them all the misfortunes that have happened to him in his life and

362
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:35,330
tells him not to give me your phone number so that we can get in touch again, how many from here have

363
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:44,100
to do again with a person and ahora que nos da la felicidad cuando se me acercó una persona cálida

364
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:51,420
cordial hablamos pasamos un buen rato llegó a personas que no veían hace mucho tiempo y bailaron

365
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:58,350
conocieron gente se divirtieron totalmente y esta persona les dice dame tu teléfono para volvernos

366
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:02,790
a encontrar cuando esté aquí después de esa experiencia le dan el teléfono y suelen encontrar

367
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:09,020
entonces qué es lo que pasa precisamente eso la felicidad nos va a dar ataques a largo plazo

368
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:14,509
donde vamos a poder sacar todas todas toda la información que queramos y la tristeza cuando

369
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:21,860
necesitamos un ataque inmediato de eso esta frase tienen que grabarse a toda su vida porque

370
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:31,000
el ingeniero social lo hace conscientemente para muchas personas en su vida porque sí no porque

371
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,010
quieren sus dato s no porque quieren su dinero nada simplemente porque sí porque disfrutando de

372
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:41,380
la desgracia en la carrera usted entonces para manipular eficazmente a la gente es necesario

373
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:47,140
hacer creer a todos que nadie les manipulan increíblemente no sé por qué eso lo dijo alguien

374
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:52,230
que estaba estrechamente relacionado para la política no he entendido entre tan sincera porque

375
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:59,850
iríamos entonces una conversación ya digamos no hay computador de por medio tengo a la persona

376
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:06,509
me lo encuentro lumbar que tengo que hacer primero conseguir la atención nuestra primera falla en una

377
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:15,540
conversación veo a la persona entonces para qué emoción a una niña divina hermosa en un bar sola

378
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:23,720
y llega a uno se arma de valor después de poco tiempo de tres horas se acerca uno y

379
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:31,850
eres una mujer tan hermosa en un lugar como este y ella responde qué

380
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:38,720
no te necesito primero llamar la atención y disculpa

381
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:45,810
inmediatamente ella se voltea el lenguaje corporal no está diciendo o la atención está en mí ahora

382
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:57,380
aunque esa persona s si yo hubiese es eso disculpa el reto de preservar destruir cambia

383
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:04,710
pausar y descartar láminas que en los primeros 10 segundos de la conversación la persona va a

384
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:11,190
evaluar si es una amenaza o no cuando nosotros en la segunda persona en la calle porque si el

385
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:22,850
disculpe bueno primero entonces es una pausa disculpe me puede decir entonces pausa y sonrío

386
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:29,580
sonrío lo suficiente para que ella descarte la mirada de esta persona no me va a amenazar

387
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:38,569
la puñalada no entonces y lo que vamos a hacer vamos a hacer un ejercicio y miren la persona

388
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:45,230
que está al lado y ahora lo primero que hace es sonreír con la mitad de la cara sólo con los ojos

389
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:50,120
y ahora mira a la persona al lado y crear otra persona le diga si son

390
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:56,529
revistas los ojos de la cara y ahora y que ahora rentable diga son raíces

391
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:06,560
complejo cierto pero hay que aprender a sonreír con los ojos ahora hágalo con la otra mitad

392
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:11,600
la otra persona a persona

393
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:23,839
sincero sincero básicamente ese mismo ejercicio lo van a hacer en sus casas

394
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:33,330
como frente al espejo primero sonrío te llenas de los recuerdos felices y todo iba a sonreír frente

395
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:45,259
al espejo y ahora si los ojos luego sonrió con eso y luego los puntos les genera una sonrisa sincera

396
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:56,480
y yo estoy feliz pero miren como parezco salir eso lo vamos a aprender cuando yo llego y lo hago más

397
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:04,370
sutil una persona como estas no disculpa es que estoy perdido primera vez que vengo a santiago

398
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:10,220
y no sé un supermercado o algo que me puede recomendar si logro mantener esa sonrisa 10

399
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:18,620
segundos la persona va a empezar a confiar en mí y eso es lo que necesitamos qué es eso que está

400
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:25,580
hasta aquí de que le digan cómo tiene que asegurar todo y todo mundo lo regañó y todo dice que es más

401
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:33,620
un trabajo vamos a generarle un oasis de confianza en estos diez primeros segundos pausa y descartar

402
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:38,480
amenaza una vez descartada la amenaza lo que vamos a hacer es reconocer la realidad de la persona

403
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:46,640
nosotros entramos y nos reconocemos la realidad de otra persona como la reconozco disculpa yo

404
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:54,029
sé que esto es un poquito extraño pero quiero decirte que diferente y esa pe rsona le importo

405
00:51:54,030 --> 00:52:01,320
yo eso es importante una vez reconoce la realidad era otra persona de personalizado él me entiende

406
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:09,819
y empujar la conversación los primeros 20 segundos si lo que necesito es generar una

407
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:14,290
conversación inmediata necesito durante 20 segundos empujar a otra persona empujarla

408
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:18,610
empujar vale hasta que otra persona empieza a responder una vez me empieza a responder

409
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:23,800
estar contribuyendo a la conversación y cuando ya la persona se interesa en

410
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:28,510
contribuir la conversación se va dando y eso no le tengas miedo a los silencios

411
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:36,630
los silencios incómodos sean cuando usted es incómoda pero si yo no estoy incómodo 5

412
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:46,950
ok si alguien tiene mayor es más rápido más tranquilos por allá

413
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:54,390
entonces porque es generar compenetración buena relación y entendimiento conformidad

414
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:59,910
la mejor manera de generar vapor en 5 minutos como hagan eso

415
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:10,550
ya no tienen que hablar ahora cómo estás y qué haces no yo me ató los cordones

416
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:20,879
y bueno a todos a todos cinco minutos y la persona ordenar el conquense en sus expresiones

417
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:29,070
lo que decide la sonrisa si ustedes se demore la boca y los ojos tiene que ser simultáneo si

418
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:33,900
un agua primero que el otro la otra persona en el subconsciente de interpretar no son sinceros

419
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:42,380
trucos de la oscura de la fuerza todo esto es lo que yo he probado y después decir funciona

420
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:54,900
bueno pues no entonces escalamiento corporal muy rápido todos los hombres y las mujeres también eso

421
00:53:54,900 --> 00:54:00,870
le sirve quiere conocer el hombre de vitruvio no quien conoce es un equipo de da vinci que está así

422
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:08,420
entonces va a ser lo mismo que es escalamiento corporal básicamente tenemos esto es un truco

423
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:15,690
qué es lo que no queremos que nos vean cuando estamos con poca ropa como son los vestidos

424
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:22,530
de baño lo último que ocurre son que los genitales entonces está en la zona roja que

425
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:35,090
vamos a hacer entre más lejos esté más fáciles como saludamos porque quedó más lejos sí o no

426
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:51,850
estaremos entonces que voy a hacer boyacá boyacá boyacá acá acá o aquí está nervioso

427
00:54:55,930 --> 00:55:05,500
gracias mucho cuidado miren eso yo que normal pero esto

428
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:15,960
la palma tiene que ver a cá la espalda que pasa que el otro que queda manejo

429
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:28,590
dental los pies entonces tocamos los pies y para eso hay ley porque esto se ve más

430
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:42,870
no hablo con ganas que vamos a hacer porque esto es incómodo porque esto es incómodo

431
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:53,580
que te quede esto es incómodo sencillo porque su mano está lejos pero dónde está su cabeza

432
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:09,480
por qué seguimos manos antebrazos más habita tocamos la espalda a cara con

433
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:14,970
la mano hacia que yo no palmas afuera para que no sea barro luego lo que podemos llegar

434
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:22,709
es la espalda baja pero la espalda baja no es donde se pierde la frontera aquí

435
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:32,260
que las piernas después de las piernas los pechos entre hombres no por favor

436
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:39,620
y luego si los genitales ese es el orden en el que ustedes pueden descargar corporalmente cuando

437
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:45,290
ustedes hacen eso lo hacen de una manera muy sutil y sin afán sin aparezca mientras corporal puede

438
00:56:45,290 --> 00:56:51,680
verse durar horas como post gran minutos listo cuando ustedes lo hacen en un grupo asegúrense

439
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:56,120
de hacer el mismo escalamiento corporal con el resto del grupo que la persona pi ense que eso

440
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:59,870
es normal y luego escalas más rápido con la persona que quieren que sea la víctima

441
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:14,400
para que antes de que el daño social 8.8 que es lo que queremos llegar a estos bolsillos es lo

442
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:21,570
que realmente llegar a estos bolsillos por tocar acá voy a acercar un clonador de tarjetas eso es

443
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:27,150
lo que queremos ver la personal de guardas usb y tener la posibilidad de meter la mano renunciando

444
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:31,080
a nuestro pulgar siempre que vayan a hacer tipo que tim renunciar a su pulgar y manejen

445
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:35,790
estos dos dedos para manejarlo si la persona no se va a dar cuenta cuando las haces aparecer

446
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,870
entonces el otro por rápido y seguro ya les dije cómo se acuerdan de la

447
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:50,720
nueva vitis ok vamos a sacarlas porque se puede una moda yo no

448
00:57:56,370 --> 00:57:57,270
un fuerte aplauso

449
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:07,750
ok te pasa mod antes una muerte

450
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:17,890
raro cierto que una persona llegue y se me acerqué me quedé mirando sonríe

451
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:26,780
horrible vamos a hacer como devolverlas para que la gente pueda ver 2

452
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:41,820
ok vamos a probar pararse en frente y levantar la voz lorenzo bien la reacción

453
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:49,750
porque los modales des pués de autoritarios verdadero paradero en el no como lo es el comer

454
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:58,790
de esos presos chilenos también cierto ahora

455
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:07,760
para hacer frente a levantar la voz y tocarlos de una manera normal lorenzo como a ir a verte

456
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:22,290
hombre que pasa es cálido 3 son cálidos pero vamos a ver qué pasa con 4 bien eso

457
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:30,000
es diferente porque lo que pueden ver ahí es que no volví carismático y que es carismático

458
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:39,010
aunque no parezca a largo plazo esto logró un escalamiento corporal inmediato a dónde todas sus

459
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:46,330
credenciales pueden ser copiadas bien en donde una carga normalmente las credenciales aquí tenemos

460
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:55,000
como copiarlas acá si la tengo oculta en la manga tengo como las tarjetas de crédito ok está bien

461
00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:59,240
esas son cuatro

462
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:09,870
cuando el tiempo pero que pasa 4 carismático ya pero cuando una persona hola cómo estás

463
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:18,480
increíble verte raro muy raro 4 está bien 5 está correctamente mal

464
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:24,230
ok entonces eso

465
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:32,480
y bueno y lo último vamos a parchear compartíamos básicamente van a llegar a sus compañías van

466
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:39,200
a evaluar los ataques de ingeniería social qu e necesitan y que van a hacer atacan funciona educa

467
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:49,680
vuelvo y atacó y comparó mis resultados estadísticos entre esto cuando volví a

468
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:58,799
atacar y ahora cuando redujo redujo con respecto a lo que las personas volvieron a caer si si

469
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:07,710
todavía muchas personas son víctimas como el director de la cia y alguien leyó eso que un

470
01:01:07,710 --> 01:01:11,700
adolescente llamó y le dijo que era de su compañía de celulares y les ayuda estará

471
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:19,620
a ellos entonces atacan educan y estarán su informe cuántos problemas cayeron tantas vuelvo y

472
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:26,430
atacó redujo y volví sacó el informe si todavía es muy alto vuelve atacó y educó y así sucesivamente

473
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:34,080
hay desde los primeros pasos una serie de ejercicios para que hagan para que vayan

474
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:38,340
perdiendo la dividen se les puedan acercar a las personas y hacer lo que ustedes quieran bajo su

475
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:43,770
responsabilidad no de responsable nada muchas gracias a estas personas el doctor ekman la

476

doctora esta autoridad experta en detección de mentiras muy bacano esta persona es experta en

477
01:01:49,830 --> 01:01:56,880
carisma este de riesgo sólo si lo pueden ve r yo navarro esta gente el experto de interrogación

479
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:10,170
por último muchas gracias y twitter me escribe por ahí si necesiten y público excelente dañado

480
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:23,820

481
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:51,730
bueno gracias por tu y tengan bien visto mucho y buena información aquí vamos a andar preocupado

482
01:02:51,730 --> 01:03:04,870
no sólo tuvo experto en realidad este post tras el final que tú dices que analiza ataca y reduzca

483
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:11,140
cierto que pasaría en algún momento como los hemos enfrentado cuando haces esto pero después

484
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:17,470
tus propios compañeros o gente que conozco amigos empiezan a cuestionarse la duda siempre porque al

485
01:03:17,470 --> 01:03:22,270
final tú estás haciendo ver aquí educando y por qué no darán por sí cuando en el mismo punto no

486
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:29,550
sea como te dije tú intentan mantener la confianza o la cercanía con esas personas ok primero si es

487
01:03:29,550 --> 01:03:37,410
muy difícil se pierden muchas personas pero lo primero es porque porque realmente uno renuncia

488
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:42,930
a ellas porque porque te das cuenta de que amistades son sinceras y cuáles no si volvés

489
01:03:42,930 --> 01:03:48,750
lorenzo e s una persona está gabriel también y ellos ya vieron mi charla y me siguen hablando

490
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:59,009
pero hay algo muy sencillo es muy sencillo todo lo que te mostré es psicología total lo

491
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:03,420
que quiere decir que funciona y cada semana ellos ya no exactamente lo que yo hago y no

492
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:10,560
les importa y tercero uno tiene que vivir una vida sincera o sea totalmente sin ser es lo

493
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:16,020
mejor o sea uno se cansa de saber que no tiene que estar mintiendo todo el tiempo entonces lo

494
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:20,670
que es la sinceridad total y la gente se da cuenta vez que implemente sin servicio las

495
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:25,350
cosas como el bien y si me dio la gana de sorprenderme porque me regalaron un viaje

496
01:04:25,350 --> 01:04:31,200
o porque viaje en bus o porque bien bajaron [ __ ] una persona yo lo digo y lo hago y la

497
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:36,450
gente al final se da cuenta que mi vida como ingeniero social está totalmente aparte de

498
01:04:36,450 --> 01:04:43,410
mi vida como amigo o compañero de algunas de las personas que se quedan esas son la última

499
01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:48,640
y no muchas gracias

500
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:54,160
