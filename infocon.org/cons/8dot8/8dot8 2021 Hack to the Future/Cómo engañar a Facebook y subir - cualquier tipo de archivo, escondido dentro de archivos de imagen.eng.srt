1
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:45,190
Well, as I was saying, there are only three talks left, but we think they are one

2
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,930
of the best, so now there is a serial with Joaquín, automated.

3
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:18,140
Well, this talk is to be done. I needed internet and there is no internet.

4
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:23,119
I'm going to show half of what I was going to show and the other is golden brown and that they imagine

5
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,450
how

6
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:38,630
big there is no active wave,

7
00:01:54,290 --> 00:02:01,840
the idea of ​​the talk is to be able to automate the processes that we do manually through

8
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,900
script back with php and also explain what things we are doing, for example the first

9
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:15,080
case that We are going to see it will be to hide a file inside another for example to find

10
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:22,340
an mp3 inside an image and that image then upload it to twitter and in this way we can have

11
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:29,960
twitter flickr facebook as an mp3 or program or movie store without that they detect it

12
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:38,090
to show them that facebook twitter internet can test it later but we are going to test

13
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:42,920
the script and without losing consistency verifying the border md5 of the files

14
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:09,440
to be able to hide u In a file inside we go to the catch command that is used to concatenate a

15
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,560
file with another file or more than one file and then to separate the files we are going to use

16
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:21,740
split passing it with arguments the bits or bytes that correspond to the separation

17
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:26,320
of the file so that they are not stop what I want we are going to do a test first

18
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,260
we are going to make a screenshot

19
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,170
that was the image that the screenshot is given

20
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,860
and we are going to copy an mp3 that I have in the directory

21
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:32,429
we have the file bird point m3 which is an audio file and the file made 1

22
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:41,670
point for energy than an old image with the command we are going to concatenate the audio file

23
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:47,070
below the image file and we are going to call it an image in two points or an image one point in axis

24
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:14,370
we have the concatenated image that is a png And it weighs twice as much because here the

25
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:21,930
sum of the mp3 bad png weighs and if I want to see the image the concatenated image

26
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,469
can also see the image is not corrupted

27
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:46,350
then what I have here are two files in one and to separate it n I need to know the number

28
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:51,270
of bytes that the first element has and separate it and to go up to the split command

29
00:05:52,960 --> 00:06:01,049
the first element that is 1b on the axis has 58 thousand 556

30
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:16,410
and I separate the image I look at three files the first is going to be the image

31
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:23,950
the second is going to to be part of the mp3 and the third to do another part

32
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:33,810
because it creates three files and not two because the first file has a different size smaller

33
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:39,240
than the file action that go sideways the spirit separates me between therefore to make

34
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:45,410
a well-made spirit I have to have the two bytes of the two files and there is the grace to

35
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:52,630
automate this process with a script that reads me the first byte of a file, it passes the 20

36
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:57,550
the first file the bytes of the file are and I saved it at the end of the concatenated file and

37
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:04,780
then another script that reads it since the last string in that file and to make the

38
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:13,030
numbers and magón split and we will see how lm of 5 is not modified and that to a consistent file

39
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,840
we use the same bird mp3 file and 1

40
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:31,770
hide er the file in file 21 the bird file point 93 and we are going to call it

41
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:38,150
obfuscated point png and files each point does not leave created

42
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,130
I am here in our image and if we see it with the image viewer

43
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,800
in the image of the image you

44
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:08,240
need the sizes and that the same as before and the hide script

45
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:14,970
I do not know if it is read or not we are going to see others

46
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,820
a great desire

47
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,820
is the script and the same thing that I told you with words this does it automatically

48
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,420
and notice that in this line it

49
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:06,590
adds something that I did not call a separator in the amount of

50
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,570
bits since it is added to the end of the file

51
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:17,760
so that after writing I want that I do not know where to do the split

52
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,170
and on

53
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,620
that is the file that we create and if we go to the end of the file we see Some numbers here below

54
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:58,260
is the amount of view of the first file are from file and the script that separates the files

55
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:08,260
reads that amount of days the necessary spirit and leaves the files as they were

56
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,720
to find obfuscated png point

57
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,439
and we have the original file file point of

58
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,380
view dad and original png file that are the files that he separated

59
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,500
and if we see the md5 that the mi5 of the original mp3 point file

60
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:43,100
is different from the bird, something does not go wrong but

61
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,720
the original png file does not matter with the m5 of 1 point ng

62
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:04,090
and thus not loses file consistency and if these flickr

63
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:12,150
files are uploaded to facebook whatever they look like in the file header it says that this gesture

64
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:20,160
lets it upload and if it has a size limit of 5 megabytes it already uploads an mp3 5mb pro and then the

65
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,300
'stop 'Well, its image that weighs a kilo and all the rest that is music that is the program

66
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:31,360
and they do not detect it cannot be the proof because there is no internet but they have to trust

67
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:42,920
this is a demonstration of how some know that it is possible with what having two

68
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:49,790
files I knew that you could have an audio with a video a video with an

69
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:55,219
mp3 a chip with a tar but I did it in an automated way to make life easier for

70
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:30,090
the next script and we are going to test it is a script that automates attack

71
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:34,800
tasks on about servers and In this case on wordpress

72
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,010
in my virtual machine I pass the tests

73
00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:03,080
in a typical configuration of the servers, the user apache www2 has to have read access

74
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:09,350
to the files that he wants to show, therefore, all users in the case that they do not

75
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:15,950
have contact with the system They have to have in their home or in the directory where the

76
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:20,900
two sites have a directory of the typical public html for example and there they have all the files that

77
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:27,790
are eligible for the use of patching if they cannot show us another grace is that also so

78
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:31,030
that the Users to authenticate must be able to read the file of that password

79
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:37,949
then having the file etc password with the home of each user we are going to make

80
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:46,620
a type of program I define it in this php script that looks for me within the count

81
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:56,500
cause obtained from the etc password the directories public html www php public ftp and inside them it

82
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:03,200
will look for the double conflict file php and get the connection user to the base

83
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,320
to all the connection passion to the database and all the information of the site

84
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,540
and apart there is a function that an administrator user can create within the site

85
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,690
and I set up in the Serbian a virtual machine that has like 5 sites in

86
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:53,720
wordpress to do the test for example by giving it a Lawyer name

87
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,469
point will be the org point

88
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:09,460
I have 3 j pérez jb 10 points in the org point

89
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:18,280
two wordpress default internships I none no special configuration

90
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:24,349
and the script I have the root test cables point will be the point over there

91
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:36,610
the writing is called w config discover and we are going to execute it only with one click

92
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,470
and I like information from the eyes with the key obviously the key

93
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:46,170
this figure because if it were encrypted the wordpress could not connect either

94
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:51,089
then the grace that takes advantage of the apache has to be able to read that file

95
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:57,040
and having your information the script connects from behind

96
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,880
and creates a user as minister as administrator

97
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,900
so far the user does not exist

98
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:29,760
false administrator password then we are going to create it through the utility

99
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,040
and there it tells me that it created the user fake admin with the elda password domain

100
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,550
I do not know we try to enter now

101
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,330
we have access as administrator and we have access as visitor to all

102
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:03,810
the wordpress blogs of that system and as well as it is wordpress we can also do the

103
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:09,179
same script that does a search for the configuration file pachelbel point of the joomla or

104
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:13,230
the data you see point that of the symphony or any framework that we use cms

105
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:22,730
when we have to do some testing some audit

106
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:26,900
we usually do manual things we look where We can navigate the inside

107
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,770
of the directory which files we have read permission and this automates

108
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:39,980
how we can solve this complicated

109
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:51,930
one can put the user in a cage which the apache's paste can only leave

110
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:56,760
the user's home so perhaps it can read the password etc but it cannot enter with the other user

111
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:03,910
there are some administrators who remove read permissions from the home user but e The young giuseppe

112
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:08,170
tablet in this topic that also has reading and if you enter directly you can enter if

113
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:12,700
you enter the home user as apache they do not lower the list, the directory does not work to enter

114
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,690
but if you enter a higher level directly with giuseppe publishes this month and you you are going to leave they

115
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,909
want to see the writing

116
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,630
this is the variable I indicated it here the directory has to

117
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:48,870
look for the possible directors where a wordpress could be installed

118
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,169
is the wordpress configuration file in the case that it is from the jungle we change

119
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,110
that for rain for example done on average as the file is called

120
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:07,780
if we cannot read files from that password we exit and say that

121
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:14,170
it can not be simply otherwise we pass and here he begins the walk of the configuration file

122
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:18,460
where we get the user the password and all the information of the blog

123
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:28,480
the males with regular pressures on the beauty of the steam of benin

124
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,790
and we define the actions that I have on the script that with creating

125
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:38,930
users delete users the create user function

126
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:48,169
simply connects to the database and insert the necessary records to be able to create

127
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:52,490
the user the class directly the advanced one as a user and password which is something in

128
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:58,380
the configuration file and the it option eliminates the user so as not to leave them back

129
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,220
to others I think I am going to show that it is thought that I do not know if I have time to

130
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:23,679
give my life when one does in testing, generally we do not want to spend as little

131
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,370
time as possible inside the server therefore we have to rescue art information to analyze it

132
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:33,159
on the premises and see what can be done for that a long time ago with a friend we made a script

133
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:38,590
it is also based on the theory of can read the password lts for

134
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:42,189
about and remove the directors of the when the user and does a recursive search of

135
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:46,560
all of all files that can so that later you have a list

136
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,399
of all the files recursively on the server and you can know

137
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:56,370
on which director this read permission on q ue directors and files of the first its writing

138
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:01,770
on which file you do not have writes permission to know how far your attack can go

139
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:11,330
I do not have a demo to show you but I have the result of an output file of this script

140
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,860
this is the result of when we execute writes session

141
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,040
for example here tells us that we have planned writings on this and on this of files

142
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:23,290
within this host so we already know that when if we want to upload a file we already know to leave it

143
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:36,980
I remembered all the server I did not do an authorization by dinners

144
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,600
the script

145
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,220
as a parameter Not only does he write, we give him how

146
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,830
we want one to save the file, but we want him to compress it to

147
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:15,290
download the big ones, he can use the civilian, the file, he can think a lot,

148
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,360
this is where he does the magic that reads the file, this is the password

149
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,650
and per user and uruguay of shares of that resource

150
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:43,890
and I am not good also so that it does not search try to search for directories on the robot

151
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:48,180
or files on directories that The authors who do not have a home do not have

152
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:51,720
a web page and then we pass them that the wide 10 is greater

153
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,990
than a thousand because always generally the 1000 only users ahead

154
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,480
is simply a recursive ls, give it a file

155
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:19,200
and well the idea was more than anything like show how to automate processes daily tasks

156
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:25,650
that we do when we do research work when we do pen testing and you can automate the

157
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:29,250
making script to improve the times so that it is easier and the simplest

158
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:41,129
good is that the script that does not measure is contains a file inside another to test they can

159
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:46,080
use their twitter their facebook to do the test and it will work for them, we

160
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:49,700
are going to work

161
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:06,470
and the other to write I do not know the others because I need the internet

162
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:10,190
to demonstrate it not even half the operation of the time

163
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,280
in other

164
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,040
questions

165
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:40,670
such hello do you plan to leave under public domain some of the scripts that you showed if they are under

166
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:49,170
public domain where in my blog blog point will be the pointer although per I have

167
00:25:51,180 --> 00:26:00,120
another question yes, hello, look, I have a site where you upload images, videos, so I have the doubt if

168
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:10,979
it goes up on the bridge, it had a cello, an executable, I don't know how I use third-party libraries and I have

169
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:18,180
already done tests and passing more hacker bridges. use that mechanism and then run

170
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:26,640
that script let's say I couldn't hide files but and I could upload them I could make a beta pass it

171
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:32,160
's like a photo but from there to running it is different because at some point you don't

172
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:40,500
change the bridge you an ex and I put png and I uploaded it to facebook but eventually I was always left

173
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:46,980
with the doubt if they could execute it or not but it went up, it's not me if it went up on the naturalness

174
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:53,400
by extension no more facebook of course of course and it was not long ago in fact it was this year the title

175
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:59,460
executes I will make sure every day of png with the image viewer of course if something was not seen at all but I

176
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:05,490
am left wondering if they could take it and execute it to do something malicious they know theory

177
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:10,950
should have validated by the type file and not by the extension since it is but it is going to execute it

178
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,879
last question

179
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:31,510
a query in relation to having the pick up that applies is the file to attach it at the

180
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:37,600
time of making the look by uploading the file to facebook twitter or ofir As you

181
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:44,560
mentioned, most of these pages use an algorithm to transform the image if, even so,

182
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:50,860
when you download the image again, you can recover the other file or simply when, for

183
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:57,699
example, you want facebook where the system is uploading the file, it does a 67 of

184
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:02,920
transformers or that it changes the extension and applies some filters there it loses sense but

185
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:07,390
that has to keep the original photo just for that for example in twitter acts audiences

186
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:11,830
as in practice it does not work then for example if you upload to twitter give it dimension

187
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:17,629
It is but somehow it can still reach the original you can actually see a thumbnail

188
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:22,370
preview but the original is always available everywhere p or at least twitter

189
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,919
well applause for it would be slow I have

190
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:37,870
thanks well then before the next talk I wanted to

191
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:41,739
kill the boy who solved the third challenge if he can go up

192
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:47,970
so they know what the key will be it is super difficult after the pita

193
00:28:49,410 --> 00:29:02,860
then congratulations and password 1 by the way 1 was the key to the thing and well the internet created this

194
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:16,070
well I don't have many thanks and we talk then now we introduce all the

195
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:20,389
women who are going to give us the next talk then please hand

196
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:29,080
