00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,060
[Music]

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:05,160
[Applause]

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:18,480
[Music]

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,440
[Music]

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,289
[Music]

6
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:42,770
I know that a lot is true, perhaps who

7
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,600
will be there again that I know of a

8
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,890
logistical problem so that's why I can't

9
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,769
do it but they go to the

10
00:00:48,769 --> 00:00:51,110
disguised promoter outside we are very

11
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,699
happy that he has  The fifth version arrived,

12
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:55,040
these games 2011 as a crazy project,

13
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,960
we did not know if we are going to continue

14
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,180
doing it or not, but our

15
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,699
fifth edition was coming.

16
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:04,119


17
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:05,899


18
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,149


19
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:10,820
South America and we thought that

20
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,950
this could bring us a problem but

21
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,020
we are going to have a full house because

22
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,759
so many people have never registered, we have

23
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:19,580
more than 640 registered so maybe

24
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,960
we say I tell you that next year the

25
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,550
same date

26
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:27,030
I met they took the year 2011 and that

27
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,900
same  year I invited him to 8.8 5 years have passed

28
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,870
and well possible we have here so

29
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,610
also take advantage of thanking

30
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,480
telefonica h with infoport displayed because

31
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,510
with that 50 foxx and  Without taking more

32
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,820
time and offering more presentations, I

33
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,820
have it with Chema Alonso, thank you very much

34
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,250
[Applause]

35
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,969
Good morning, let's start.

36
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,180
Well, the questions you are going to ask, if

37
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:06,210
I only have a joint, it is the ego's hat.

38
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,519
There are people who keep asking but they

39
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:14,290
have a lot of gold.  Only a government not

40
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,209
only has a hat, so I have to

41
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:21,340
record well, the truth is that it is true

42
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,349
that Javier had the courtesy to invite me

43
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:26,110
to the first of the first edition but

44
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,299
the circumstances had never happened

45
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:30,970
this year at last because I was able to come

46
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,540
had  I really want to be at the

47
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,269
conference and I hope that at least the

48
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:39,790
radio with me, because you like it, I come to

49
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,910
tell you,

50
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,130
being fine here, I have no complaints

51
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:48,220
about telling you, so let's see if we have the

52
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,959
opportunity to follow it now that

53
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:52,720
we are working on the phone, continue

54
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,360
with duty you go and we can see each other many

55
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,030
more times the talk I am not going to do

56
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,260
now

57
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,110
that I come to speak now it is quite

58
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,049
simple is I am going to tell you a little how

59
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:07,329
we played in the eleven vas with

60
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:10,019
different technologies I was

61
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:14,260
lucky three years ago to receive the

62
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,480
opportunity to create a

63
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,840
security company project to develop

64
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,959
technologies and from the company I

65
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,060
had previously, I was computing 64

66
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,239
because I have been able to get many people  good

67
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,939
and ready to work with me and one of the

68
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:32,920
toys that we have made because it is one of the

69
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,840
problems that is a big data they do

70
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,870
all the difficult part within the

71
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,030
management part with all the technology and nothing

72
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,420
else is going to play with it now  entangle

73
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,069
so I have to be here that is

74
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:48,400
our center as we use it and we do

75
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,470
not have it to slide it is true

76
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,989
directly in real so that you can

77
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:54,730
see how we take advantage of this

78
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,329
technology

79
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:58,420
well the initial idea for a part of

80
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,790
this project

81
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,709
is for  the idea that we had that

82
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:07,079
android android had become

83
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:10,079
the new windows xp you know that windows

84
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:11,969
xp when it originally came out has a

85
00:04:11,969 --> 00:04:13,439
lot of problem  s security in

86
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,480
fact there is a moment when

87
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,310
microsoft itself thinks that the entire operating system platform is going to fall

88
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,988


89
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:20,910
because the windows xp time system was

90
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,220
born at a very

91
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,340
complicated moment in the history of microsoft

92
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,800
had been denounced for competition in

93
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,460
europe  And due to this complaint, it is

94
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,740
operational, it cannot add any

95
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,099
characteristic of which there is already an

96
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:39,870
industry in the market.This

97
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,940
means that when a second sheriff does not

98
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,759
have any security features,

99
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,509
remember that Microsoft was

100
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:50,160
denounced for putting a

101
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,660
multimedia player on windows

102
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,139
to  That sounds absurd nowadays

103
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:59,210
because that was a complaint not because there was

104
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,530
an industry of multimedia players,

105
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,479
this led to the fact that

106
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,669
when windows xp came out without an

107
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:09,490
update manager without a firewall without

108
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,289
any protection and antispyware or anti

109
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:15,139
malware or anything because the industry

110
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:17,120
had  a lot of attacks and security flaws

111
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,030


112
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,460
so much so that in the end microsoft

113
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,810
He chose to break everything and more than 10

114
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,250
years ago to use operating systems

115
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,620
well, in the

116
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,390
android world our vision is that

117
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,370
more or less the same has happened and in this case it has

118
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,949
happened

119
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:37,030
taking advantage of another feature

120
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:40,150
that is an advantage of android and that  it is

121
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,919
an inconvenience at the same time the

122
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,479
advantage is that it works in any

123
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:46,000
terminal the disadvantage is that

124
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,190
supporting all terminals is a

125
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,560
problem the advantage is that it is very

126
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,180
open when uninstalling

127
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,190
applications from any market the

128
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:58,550
problem is that it can be

129
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,500
yes  the great news is practically

130
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,240
every day there are discoveries of

131
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,510
new applications

132
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:08,480
the graphics are quite ugly when you

133
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,980
see it malware for android mobile devices

134
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:15,890
99% rest but still a little bit and

135
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,420
that is the idea with which we started

136
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,550
working as how we were going to

137
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,860
discover  to the

138
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,680
malicious applications in these environments

139
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,390
we started to work with this but we

140
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,490
realized that the thing was enough  The

141
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,680
worst thing that there is not only in the

142
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,170
android world is that if we go to the root of the

143
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,420
applications in the android world we continue

144
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,940
to google play because the thing was more or

145
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,940
less the same in fact in the next

146
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,380
slide and I am going to put you a lot

147
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,380
of whatsapp applications all of them

148
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,010
have been admitted and published in

149
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,480
google play so that people can

150
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,130
download it to us if you put the

151
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,600
real whatsapp in less than three

152
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,390
seconds 123 the salt drop

153
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,360
but all the others have been approved

154
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,110
and published in google  play is to say that

155
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,990
a user who was looking for them could

156
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,140
locate them to see I do not know you have to be very

157
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:14,909
smart to know that it cannot be good to

158
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:22,260
know there, well it is that we will

159
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,240
focus on seeing how we could

160
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,850
analyze the applications of all

161
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,860
markets and in  also specifically the one of

162
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,170
google play because it is not possible there is

163
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,580
no database that you can go and

164
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,930
collect the applications without

165
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,570
consulting them there is none of that so

166
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,790
we

167
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,430
start thinking how it goes  We are going to create a

168
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,560
database with all the

169
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,420
android applications that are published in

170
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,820
all markets that is what for us

171
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,890
is the origin of the project that is nothing

172
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,450
more than making use of open solos

173
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,940
intelligent, you know, let's go to the internet,

174
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,130
we see how  we do the discovery how we

175
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,500
discover all the applications how we

176
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,610
download them not only the applications

177
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,650
but all the content related

178
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,650
to the application that has published what

179
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,750
comments they put what

180
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,910
fusion stars what references were the

181
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,070
images that were associated the

182
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,720
dates on which they were  They published the

183
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,270
dates if the information in

184
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:21,750
the files disappear, etc. We

185
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,210
collect all of that from all markets and

186
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,040
put them in a database.

187
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,470


188
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,480


189
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,640


190
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,830
and information cataloging, the

191
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,140
second of which is cloud computing

192
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,669
because we are going to have our system

193
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:41,580
it is working 365 days a year 24 by

194
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,919
7 scanning the entire internet it

195
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,990
is looking at all the markets that

196
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,000
we have monitored in real time and

197
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,050
also we constantly go back

198
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,610
to see if the

199
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,110
applications have been eliminated if they are

200
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,910
no longer found or the comments have been changed

201
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,260
or  If the

202
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,389
information related to it has changed and finally,

203
00:08:57,389 --> 00:08:59,579
we put all the power of the

204
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:03,060
dictate so that in a second you can

205
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,980
search for applications within

206
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,779
databases as you are going to see in our case of

207
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,449
45 million applications because

208
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:11,070
we can search by very characteristics

209
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,260
little ones in a matter of seconds

210
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,230
what is the objective of our objective to

211
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,750
build an intelligent open source platform

212
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,389
that will search the apps of

213
00:09:21,389 --> 00:09:23,339
all markets to do two things

214
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:25,260
that are important to us, which is

215
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,889
the spatial data correlation

216
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:30,180
crossing data from applications that are

217
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,620
published to  across different

218
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,050
markets and the temporal data relationship

219
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,600
looking for cut  do data from applications

220
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,029
that were in the past and are no

221
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:41,160
longer in such a way that we can

222
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,350
track the families of

223
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,750
malicious applications to know who was first a

224
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,550
normal developer and then went to

225
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,920
the dark side etc.

226
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,899
we have been doing this type of  tracking

227
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:52,730
we have done in our own

228
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,889
technology let's create everything from

229
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:58,550
scratch but if you want to do it we

230
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,139
were with the project about to

231
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:03,040
announce what was published a work from

232
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,690
a university in the united states

233
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,600
something called play drone plate rom

234
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,579
was a study that  they did in the

235
00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:13,100
university where basically they scan

236
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,750
google play twice

237
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,519
then instants of time to see

238
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:18,019
what the changes will be and they have an

239
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:20,029
analysis of the information look for other

240
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:21,380
passwords had to harpo of fairies

241
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,889
how many of apicc and could be found

242
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:26,449
in the applications how many had a

243
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:28,100
bug  security back large

244
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,470
etcetera if you want to do it and build

245
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,750
our own database  Because you

246
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,730
have the play drones code as a base

247
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,560
for everything published on the internet,

248
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,660
there is even a fort, so in order to

249
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,029
adapt it to your environment

250
00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:43,030
the difference with us

251
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,310
is that ours is to throw away and fall

252
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,540
computing is

253
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,540
constantly working this is

254
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,040
integrating applications in realtime  It

255
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,259
is injecting them in realtime for all

256
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:56,209
the characteristics so that it is very

257
00:10:56,209 --> 00:10:58,249
easy to search for it and what we have done

258
00:10:58,249 --> 00:11:00,529
has been to organize in the tools

259
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:01,790
that we give to security analysts

260
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,949
to look for things so

261
00:11:03,949 --> 00:11:07,069
this is basically looking for things you have

262
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:10,690
understood what  the games

263
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:14,290
ok well let's see we will work

264
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,410
that is better

265
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,029
good these are the aspects that it has

266
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:19,480
was good it

267
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,920
is perfect

268
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,829
good to see how the internet is going learn

269
00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:28,689
a cable just in case the cable

270
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:34,309
[Music]

271
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,470
this is basically from the console and what

272
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,370
we have here to search for

273
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:40,399
applications and you say hey how many

274
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,670
applications we have in total we give you

275
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,440
4.5 million applications  of

276
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,339
which 874 thousand have already been is in the

277
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:51,290
past they have already been eliminated they are no

278
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,520
longer in their original location

279
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,860
we have each and every one of

280
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,660
these applications because we will save

281
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,610
all their characteristics if we look for

282
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,610
example facebook well we have all the

283
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:04,250
versions of  age of home and then

284
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,899
all the details because the information

285
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:08,089
we got from it downloads

286
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:11,839
the package information sizes the

287
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,790
permissions each and every one of the

288
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,680
permissions that ask what you see

289
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,190
but that basically asks you for all

290
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,470
help here to put to your  son I don't know what

291
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,860
it means

292
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:28,220
and e-mails they appreciate links links to the market

293
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,019
to know follow information with other

294
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:32,209
applications give us the

295
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,160
digital certificate important dates of the

296
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,619
files developer data the

297
00:12:36,619 --> 00:12:38,809
manifest comments that have been

298
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:41,449
published related to the application the

299
00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:43,970
images etc. and all this

300
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,919
information  It is indexed so that

301
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:47,839
we can search

302
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,660
what we want at the click of a button if  We would like it to be

303
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,730
an example how many applications have

304
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,980
more than a million downloads if they have

305
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,609
the permission of the set and for example we

306
00:12:58,609 --> 00:13:00,459
give the magic button

307
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:05,899
32 which are the ones that go to the rows we

308
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:09,369
are not going to save the facebook

309
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,410
this is basically what

310
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,390
From here on, you can play in two

311
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:17,030
ways, play either from the point of

312
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,040
view of judo research or play

313
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,530
with a pete. I'm going to see what a mess,

314
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,960
then, for example, you could do things

315
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,120
like hey, okay, tell me all the

316
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,200
applications published in  google play

317
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,110
that have been marked as an

318
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:36,590
antivirus that has already been covered,

319
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,720
that is, they are no longer available and that

320
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,899
in the title they have the word antivirus

321
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:49,069
that is, it is automatic

322
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,990
140 applications that you can

323
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,670
investigate all of them have their

324
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,220
characteristics and then you can search

325
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,410
things related do not look for

326
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:00,569
relationships in this case because we could

327
00:14:00,569 --> 00:14:03,869
look at the strings to see what are

328
00:14:03,869 --> 00:14:06,209
the links that use this domain to

329
00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:08,249
locate  other applications that

330
00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:10,379
use the same plan for

331
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:13,350
back-end technology, whatever you want,

332
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:16,080
you can look for more silly things like tell me

333
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,580
all the applications that have put

334
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:21,740
a password in a text file,

335
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,290
because there is always someone who

336
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,060
thinks it is a good idea  For example

337
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:31,060
and we have eight and this loneliness if you are going

338
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,800
to see the links

339
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,250
and in the links we look here for the password

340
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:41,090
the gospel 45 and there is the password

341
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,800
of the colleague that he has put in the

342
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,359
dropbox cake so that nobody

343
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,199
what you want logically we will

344
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,820
We use in many ways if we are

345
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,250
auditing a company or

346
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,500
what we are monitoring the security of

347
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,120
a company because maybe what

348
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,800
interests us is to know of all the apps that

349
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,500
there are how many have a link that are

350
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,120
pointing to one of my domains  or to

351
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,680
an address and it came because they are

352
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,180
making me a pt or they are doing

353
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,670
anything right, that is to say, how many

354
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,009
applications something pointing to give my own

355
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:15,600
point

356
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,089
of the est  [ __ ] of third parties

357
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:20,009
United States to search do not leave the

358
00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:24,839
obligations and then quotation marks because yes

359
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,360
we already saw because the links that have part of the

360
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,200
infrastructure

361
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,020
already allow us to discover things about

362
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,870
the infrastructure of the 1000 point varnish

363
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:38,170
or do research I am going to tell

364
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,810
one in a very  Simple look at how

365
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:44,790
easy it is to locate a

366
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,810
seasonal hardware which and how it changes,

367
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,790
finding over time for

368
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,530
a very simple thing in this case that

369
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:53,590
uses the pencil and that are the apis

370
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,300
that are used for the case s to

371
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,830
use third-party libraries that

372
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,570
register they get a piquín and

373
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,910
put it in the code this should not

374
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,340
appear in the code because that

375
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,930
ricky must use environments

376
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,360
environments with three legs that is, we have

377
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,400
a portal put it on the mobile they are

378
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,020
delivered to all  users but

379
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,949
many use it

380
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,960
applications that have been uploaded to

381
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,310
google play that are also dead

382
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:24,040
that are dead because some antivirus

383
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,190
of what  that we have there has

384
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,200
marked them as these sms that are

385
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,880
malicious applications that

386
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,010
subscribe to premium sms, that

387
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,870
is, the one that subscribes to a

388
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,940
premium sms system works and you are paying

389
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:40,000
money for it every day every month and

390
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
that also has an

391
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,790
increase

392
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,860
that has a villa at least in the

393
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,780
code and

394
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,460
well we have already seen 23

395
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:58,470
applications in this case and I

396
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,570
established three applications because we know

397
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:03,230
that

398
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,520
if

399
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,010
you are good it is here we have one for

400
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:30,440
example this one called you see that

401
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,510
it is called lightening snooker  Kings is an

402
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,520
application that responds to it says that it

403
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,730
is already launched now pull up google play we see

404
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,460
the developer of the itam and if

405
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,810
we open it we give all the details of the

406
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,929
application

407
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,550
or it is good to see all the

408
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,260
details here and as you can see it has an api that

409
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,790
is ricky is  for a sdk if you are a

410
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:56,400
smart cybercriminal because once you

411
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,590
get caught what you do is flush everything

412
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:02,130
down the toilet including lazaridis but

413
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,110
like these sometimes e  s expensive it is better to

414
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,420
reuse and then we give the

415
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,700
magic button this to find me

416
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,890
within the 4.5 million all those

417
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,010
applications that are in google play

418
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:15,780
that are in google play and that have

419
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:19,230
this africa and we give it and one is already there is

420
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,810
no  the 43 applications that have

421
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,670
this then if we are going to close that

422
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,950
vicky has the same and we go to the

423
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,660
last page the oldest one

424
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,460
we see that initially they were used by

425
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,920
developers called new light up you

426
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,870
see all the applications of this

427
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:36,540
developer have no longer added them

428
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,520
They have been withdrawn so what

429
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,620
he does is change and start using

430
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,390
a new one called mobile stockings

431
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,860
when he takes the [ __ ] out of the

432
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,540
infrastructure

433
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,510
and starts using the developers in

434
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,940
this case the gay down

435
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,530
there is ours but if we go to the

436
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,560
present  We have a vast number of filters and

437
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,810
we are going to the future, what we have is that

438
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,520
now you are using one that is called

439
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,180
over developers in addition to dir and they

440
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,040
will be malicious  or it will have been reconverted

441
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,070
because we do not know but of course if

442
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,810
we have to invest now in reviewing

443
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,760
we will invest it better in this type

444
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,530
of suspicious applications than in the

445
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,970
rest so that you can get an idea

446
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:20,040
we are discovering more or

447
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,080
less about ten thousand applications  new

448
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,450
every day if you had to analyze those

449
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,790
ten thousand with sandbox it is by looking at how

450
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,110
malicious applications work

451
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,780
today that are executed one out of every

452
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,210
seven times 24 hours after they have

453
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,490
been installed for example it is something very

454
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:37,590
typical because you die doing it with

455
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,690
sandbox  If you had to do

456
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:43,680
it in reverse for now 10,050 you will need

457
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,230
daily to look at all the apps it

458
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:48,180
is in our idea you have understood

459
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,790
what we do

460
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,230
that you would like to play is to look for

461
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,650


462
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,780
good things this is one of the things we

463
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,970
do let's go what is the way to

464
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,450
work  Well, our way is,

465
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:05,930
we rely on locating two things, one

466
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:09,970
the first, the romaría, an anomaly, something

467
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:14,420
that catches our attention  to put it

468
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,610
in a short list is to say something that

469
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,820
sounds bad in the application, for example

470
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,680
applications that the paris saint does not

471
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,520
look like at all

472
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,230
the name of the package does not look at

473
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,990
all like

474
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,940
the name of the application that may

475
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,230
mean that there has been a change  of

476
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,150
name following versions that is

477
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,860
usually murky let's investigate it

478
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,170
applications that have names from

479
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:37,950
the game prize I do not know how many

480
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:41,770
widely used names and that occupy very little

481
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:44,350
if you are going to have graphics to make games

482
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,700
probably in another busy

483
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,679
application of two megabytes or three megabytes

484
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,350
dangerous applications that ask for

485
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:53,550
certain types of permissions I will mix

486
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,480
applications in certain types of

487
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,130
permissions and certain words

488
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:00,610
in the name of the obligation one of the

489
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:03,280
cases could count is an

490
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,970
application that promised magic as

491
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,890
if you touch it it gives you cramp or that you can

492
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:11,860
scan the girls and other naked

493
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,330
factory and untimely android

494
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,960
does not work

495
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,380
and I say it for the week reversion d  In his

496
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,999
eyes

497
00:21:24,999 --> 00:21:27,659
there are many types of applications

498
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:30,129
so what we do is

499
00:21:30,129 --> 00:21:32,199
within our platform we apply

500
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:35,289
three types of intelligence first the

501
00:21:35,289 --> 00:21:37,119
intelligence that you have seen not that of

502
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:40,119
one day team his hat entangling playing

503
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:42,759
and to see what comes to him that we will see

504
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:45,099
in filters  A filter is nothing more than

505
00:21:45,099 --> 00:21:47,529
a combination of text search, what

506
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:48,639
do I do about selecting this

507
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:49,989
feature? This feature here

508
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:52,629
I make the filter and it is saved

509
00:21:52,629 --> 00:21:55,149
within the analysis, you see dell,

510
00:21:55,149 --> 00:21:57,699
from that moment on, any new

511
00:21:57,699 --> 00:22:00,819
application that goes away will dictate  discovering it

512
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,319
goes through all the filters that have been

513
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:04,569
created and they are generating the

514
00:22:04,569 --> 00:22:06,249
short list of applications for

515
00:22:06,249 --> 00:22:09,069
us to look at them.The second of them is that the

516
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:10,959
filters are shared we

517
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:12,669
make a collective intelligence system one makes a

518
00:22:12,669 --> 00:22:14,919
filter and puts it as a public now

519
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:16,269
From that moment all the rest of the

520
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:18,669
users also have those filters

521
00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:21,579
and the third one because we apply in

522
00:22:21,579 --> 00:22:23,319
learning techniques  that some we will do

523
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:25,719
directly inside and others we give

524
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,819
outside that we do because all the

525
00:22:27,819 --> 00:22:29,199
applications that have been thrown by

526
00:22:29,199 --> 00:22:32,379
some thing the profile masters we make them

527
00:22:32,379 --> 00:22:34,929
some good profiles and then we pass them

528
00:22:34,929 --> 00:22:36,549
through the machine learning ear to

529
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:39,669
know which characteristics are the most

530
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:41,979
important of  In fact, we have a

531
00:22:41,979 --> 00:22:43,179
published paper that we did in the

532
00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:44,529
conferences, we did not talk about what

533
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,719
were the most common combinations of permissions

534
00:22:46,719 --> 00:22:49,389
in malicious applications and

535
00:22:49,389 --> 00:22:51,159
how with a high degree of probability

536
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:54,119
some classes that had those permissions

537
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:56,559
automatically and had a

538
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,069
very large reality of being malicious  well

539
00:22:59,069 --> 00:23:01,419
we do a lot of research to publish

540
00:23:01,419 --> 00:23:02,829
we have asked is one we have published

541
00:23:02,829 --> 00:23:06,219
yesterday of how the investigations are

542
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:08,830
being carried out by companies like flight

543
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,830
china mobile and fortinet that spoke of

544
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,410


545
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:17,190
different versions of android demand

546
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,270
adware for android

547
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,890
they were really all the same group and

548
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,510
we through  the cidh in been

549
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,340
coron  I go all the information to

550
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,860
close the timeline you have it explained

551
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,020
in detail there and one of the

552
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:32,310
investigations because with a round of

553
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,940
names you have the paper

554
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:39,030
described everything is quite

555
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:41,820
funny I used the theme the trick of

556
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,890
the greim links applications you already know

557
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,980
these that I know

558
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,100
that  It is installed from the first version

559
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:53,949
but if they give him dinner out of the water

560
00:23:55,639 --> 00:23:57,030


561
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,790
then you will be in the works

562
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,440
normally in its first version it is

563
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,190
usually very silly apps such as its

564
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,200
screen progress or an application a little game

565
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,740
and a lot or a help manual  to

566
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,960
anything and that obligation then when it already

567
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,150
has an installed base, well

568
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:17,400
what is done becomes malicious

569
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,950
after malicious and does something in this case of

570
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:22,200
these that we detected were hundreds of

571
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,780
three applications and what they did were

572
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:30,290
the Chinese that we baptized  affectionately

573
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,680
what I had done is revert reversion

574
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,930
the protocol that android used to

575
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:41,080
create you the user is configuring in

576
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,550
android by  The first time he asks you for a

577
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,960
username and password that you create a

578
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,730
google play account because with my he did not

579
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:48,790
ask for captchas the uncle knew how to rovérsio that

580
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,560
to automatically create the users

581
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,340
of the applications

582
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,900
that the applications installed on the

583
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,600
devices and what he did was you

584
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,430
have  Your android user he with the

585
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:02,200
application creates another

586
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,680
android user register your phone with that

587
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,120
new user in such a way that your

588
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,640
phone has two users, yours and the

589
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,860
one created by you, you do not see why

590
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,170
you continue to use your session and this

591
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:15,880
user  Once the authentic one receives

592
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,750
the google entourage, it automatically

593
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,750
reports it to Mr. Aaron's control panel

594
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:25,240
directly always and puts it in

595
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,070
a database and with that writing that

596
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:30,430
to maximize the impact what he did

597
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,710
was that he received all of the apps from all the apps

598
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,330
the illicit ones that after paying the

599
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:36,010
user device and

600
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:38,650
then do it with this entourage by going to

601
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,930
other devices to use another

602
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:43,180
device with the cit  and shop touch

603
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,920
that it had generated in another and send it

604
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,290
a task and the tasks that it sent

605
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:49,300
to be first and foremost within the

606
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,220
database it sent them to tasks and the tasks

607
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,810
that it did basically of great

608
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:55,380
positioning of apps in google play

609
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,740
that is to say them  I could vote comments

610
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,540
position etc. at the end the only

611
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,370
thing they were doing was what we

612
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,910
know as black as well as the app store

613
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:08,520
optimization but I have done with

614
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,620
yungas techniques we for those random things

615
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:16,260
we got to your control panel and

616
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:21,049
for coffee

617
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:27,440
and it is curious because  There was

618
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,750
only access to this control panel from that

619
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,760
IP address that curiously coincides

620
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,050
with a marketing and

621
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,210
advertising company in China. We are not saying

622
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:38,380
it was them, but

623
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,690
Marista

624
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:43,230
[Music]

625
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,480
trace depends on publishing on the internet and

626
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,419
basically it all started with a

627
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:52,010
native application.

628
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:57,760
I left

629
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,650
if not it is not called pp

630
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:06,260
well this is this the applications

631
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,510
with which we started as you can see what

632
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,250
called us the anomaly was that  a

633
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,750
preparation that he promised magic not to

634
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,910
choose it undercover who is going to go to the

635
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:17,140
doctor has been able to download a

636
00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:24,029
medical insurance that yes I already have

637
00:27:24,029 --> 00:27:27,059
good here are the places and as you can see,

638
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:29,029
the developer is djukic

639
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:32,070
uses a 163 dot com bolt that is

640
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:34,559
a rare  form to stay that way

641
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,169
practically and then well what had

642
00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:39,840
to be put the car does not change

643
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,820
etc. if we look at the application this

644
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:47,820
one but also with an ascendant of

645
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,580
Hispanics because it was also a package and

646
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,860
what made

647
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,600
the images reuse the type

648
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,820
reused the images with us

649
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,820
we have indexed in it will dictate everything for

650
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,590
everything here we can search the images

651
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:05,260
by images then in this case of

652
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:08,320
choosing the king body scan of jujuy we can

653
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,720
say with the motto and say hey also

654
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,309
all the apps that have this same

655
00:28:12,309 --> 00:28:15,909
image we give it something traumatic end now

656
00:28:15,909 --> 00:28:17,860
we see two and now this is a new

657
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:20,700
developer that is called if printer the

658
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,370
same image same trick different from

659
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,659
developer if mir  masters this

660
00:28:25,659 --> 00:28:28,779
developer has three applications in

661
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:32,279
these applications again magic

662
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:38,130
away touch the electric screen same

663
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:40,230
trick as the type of wall because we go to

664
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:42,810
the application of the images where he has

665
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:46,159
reused this image more

666
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:51,250
and there it appears sui young lee is worth another

667
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,710
also the 163 with  Another developer

668
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:56,620
with another series of this 5 for padilla

669
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:01,090
are at night and thus up to 163

670
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:04,360
applications that it was easy to locate

671
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,870
which is the idea first, we raised the

672
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:10,990
anomaly that the investigation generates

673
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:13,300
once we know and verify that it

674
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,210
is a malicious application already  We go on to

675
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:18,430
create the singularity, that is, the

676
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,830
characteristics that will allow us to

677
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,640
locate the rest of the applications

678
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,780
once it has been attended to,

679
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,980
very

680
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:32,740
well, so a lot of

681
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,130
research,

682
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,020
the idea knows that detecting the

683
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,780
anomaly, we generate a singularity and

684
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,540
we go forward to generate the

685
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,580
anomalies  In general, the anomaly detection filters,

686
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,600


687
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,450
we try to apply any

688
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,490
idea that  It does not have to do with

689
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:52,130
directly due to the code because at

690
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,450
the moment we see the

691
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:55,669
code we have bundled it so what we

692
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:57,770
do is look at the characteristics of

693
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:00,100
everything we can and we apply

694
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,179
indexing of all the details of

695
00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:03,590
all the applications we look at  the

696
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:06,080
aggregate we decompress we remove the

697
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,160
habits of the files we remove

698
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,799
absolutely everything today we have

699
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:16,190
more than 56 application control points

700
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,290
and with them we are pulling and

701
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:20,150
some of them well,

702
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:22,640
very murky applications this is an example that I am going to

703
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,630
put now this is  a

704
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:26,299
gremlin application if you realize the name of

705
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:29,480
the application is cap row christmas is

706
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,289
misspelled because the original is

707
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,729
to attract attention and

708
00:30:35,729 --> 00:30:38,549
the packing name is discounted has to do

709
00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:40,830
with the original name of the application

710
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:43,649
if we are going to search in the  google cache

711
00:30:43,649 --> 00:30:46,379
for that country name we see that in this case

712
00:30:46,379 --> 00:30:48,230
there is an

713
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:51,470
injected application that does not look at all like the

714
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:54,060
road christmas we have here  Currently

715
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,010
we have in this case this is the

716
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:58,590
typical example of a gremlin application

717
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,570
in the business world and in the world

718
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:03,510
that we see ourselves today of

719
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,850
the attacks between states of the

720
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,740
earrings credible applications are a

721
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,470
brutal problem worth an application

722
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:14,700
gremlin is as dangerous as it can

723
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,940
be made malicious only an

724
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,130
installation many of the applications

725
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:23,340
in android have the permission of the one who

726
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,320
is account to know the

727
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,240
phone number in which they are and the name of

728
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,370
the email address if you

729
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:30,620
do not have the  10 and the email

730
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,750
installed in an android operating system

731
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:35,550
that you give to many of the

732
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,440
apps that you are on your device

733
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,660
because the email you get in

734
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,550
LinkedIn taken out on twitter the facebook

735
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,500
get the rest of the sites where you have an

736
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,110
account is trivial the way  someone

737
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,700
who controls an

738
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,770
application uses a determined game that leaves

739
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:52,660
two thousand three thousand installations four

740
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,470
thousand and that those installations t  engan

741
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:58,390
have the permission of creta camps could

742
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:01,210
know at all times which person is

743
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,520
in each of the systems of their

744
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,670
facilities and could put a model

745
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,920
to make malicious only that

746
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,690
application that is installed on the

747
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:12,460
mobile phone that has that

748
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,810
email we could do a

749
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:16,420
targeted attack which makes it very complicated

750
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,250
this that

751
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:22,060
the businesses of some

752
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,400
a little game or anything have become very fashionable on the internet something that

753
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,430
has news etc. and I go and

754
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,170
see it there then and it is like an

755
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:31,720
app shell where you put  what the

756
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,050
facilities that you have, the subject of the

757
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:38,380
app and the permissions that you have app and

758
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,850
logically an application leaves you

759
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:42,760
permissions that each one of

760
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,550
sms reis or wishes of sms or certain

761
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:47,770
things is going to be more valuable than an

762
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:50,680
application that  have fewer permissions and in

763
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,430
this case we are talking about a concept that is

764
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,710
beginning to be generated is the appetites

765
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:59,020
dances I really do not do any

766
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,670
directed attack but I dedicate myself to  create

767
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:03,190
apps that I can put in certain

768
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,830
nuclei of interest by making apps that

769
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:08,590
people will like vice, if you

770
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,030
imagine someone comes and makes an

771
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:13,960
app for the hacker community of

772
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,740
Chile,

773
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:18,380
then put back the dates of

774
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,330
all the conferences  leave here the

775
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:23,050
agendas the prices how to get to them

776
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:26,600
the towns I do not know that when you think that

777
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,280
a high percentage of the existing ones who

778
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,570
are here were going to install it

779
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,299
and then that is sold since it could have

780
00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:37,039
all cataloged and will decide any

781
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:41,120
example analysis  It is always there, for

782
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,010
example, it is the military in Jubail and the

783
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:44,299
cloyne track prop

784
00:33:44,299 --> 00:33:46,070
are two applications that have nothing

785
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,960
to do with the US Army but

786
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,630
that a company has made them and that

787
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:53,230
allow you to know where

788
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:56,600
the US Army fields are.  and they can give you

789
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,580
information on how to get there

790
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,520
if you don't control it you may have a

791
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,460
real problem so be very

792
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,629
careful with the applications to

793
00:34:13,629 --> 00:34:16,029
install because they can be game and

794
00:34:16,029 --> 00:34:17,679
not  We look at this of the

795
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,569
gremlins applications to see what

796
00:34:19,569 --> 00:34:21,070
we find

797
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:23,409
and well person of these I am going to tell the

798
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:25,449
case of our friend from the Turk the one from the

799
00:34:25,449 --> 00:34:28,489
cut road in this case

800
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:30,710
the anomaly that caught our attention was

801
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:34,639
because in the title it had the word

802
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,869
dv it

803
00:34:35,869 --> 00:34:38,860
had the  rhythm

804
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:43,690
and we drink and way of thinking at

805
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:47,199
first and this obligation promises you that

806
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,880
you can control the television

807
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,659
remotely but without infrared permission

808
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:55,230


809
00:34:58,119 --> 00:34:59,619
we go to the permissions without being

810
00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:01,359
infrared and you say and how it will be

811
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:04,288
controlled tele

812
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:09,810
well logically this application was

813
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:14,810
and then if  you look at the country

814
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:17,810
n of the are kentucky that seems the

815
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:21,890
cousin of son goku and the application is

816
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:24,080
called ringgold control marmoset they have

817
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,750
nothing to do so this is already starting to

818
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,090
be suspicious and murky for we do

819
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:31,460
the analysis and we see that it is malicious

820
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,250
What this application does

821
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:36,790
is it connects, opens a layout and

822
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:39,160
connects to a url that is put on a

823
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:43,240
server that is here on the web and this

824
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,640
site gives it links from where it is

825
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,670
You have to download the advertising to

826
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:53,460
click on it in the banner to see if

827
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,820
the

828
00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:00,060
server works well on this site

829
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,670
every time you connect a link from the place

830
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,800
where you have to download the ad as

831
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,360
you see it has to do with porn if

832
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,240
you want  Links well, well, I spend it

833
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,600
here for

834
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:15,859
I don't know, I suppose it will be with taxis for whatever reason,

835
00:36:15,859 --> 00:36:18,670
it is a horse,

836
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:24,030
the grace is that logically when

837
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,710
we do we already have the reverse and

838
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,990
we already go on to the detailed analysis of

839
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:31,230
each of the characteristics in this case

840
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:35,970
Well, if the site does a quiz about the

841
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:38,130
domain, it turns out that they had forgotten to

842
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:41,240
protect it in such a way

843
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,070
that if we look at them we can reach a

844
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:45,080
cyber identity in this case we take

845
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,210
a guy who is an

846
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:49,790
android developer from Turkey who curiously the

847
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,350
applications had been  uploaded from

848
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:54,020
Turkey that curiously

849
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,600
those strange names that I said are words in

850
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,820
Turkish we are not saying that it is him

851
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:04,570
but we are only going to put security on the

852
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:09,250
duties and  the help is and we already have the

853
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,260
application we know that it is bad we have

854
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,730
had the research and an

855
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,470
identity fiber and the next thing we can

856
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:17,740
do is how we remove all the

857
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,540
murky applications all those that are

858
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,890
within this family well with the

859
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:22,540
singularity and in this  case the

860
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,150
singularity is the layout where I was

861
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:27,250
loading the advertising brave this one

862
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:31,110
here we give it a born vote

863
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,400
and there we have the applications as you see

864
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:37,470
monopoly kingdom of more traffic weiser

865
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:40,510
botnets doctor driver simpson all

866
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:43,720
also as you see with a word because

867
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,730
the guy knows that they are going for him

868
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,920
Then to lash the malicious nine

869
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,420
quickly and study quickly and he is

870
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:52,300
digesting he has given a speed range

871
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,520
so that they do not catch him and well, as you can see, they

872
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,670
use all the brands

873
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,260
recognized by more people and that

874
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,390
easily any teacher will

875
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:03,290
install themselves yes no

876
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:05,720
more

877
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,480
[Music]

878
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,210
well, we could be like that with a lot of

879
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:15,170
security. It's the last one, as you see at the

880
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:17,930
end, what we try to do is it.

881
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:20,549
ar information

882
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:23,609
with the information by fat gives to give

883
00:38:23,609 --> 00:38:25,529
information by the

884
00:38:25,529 --> 00:38:28,079
context information of different markets and so on

885
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,929
to remove all to clean the area

886
00:38:30,929 --> 00:38:33,749
once we have found and this we

887
00:38:33,749 --> 00:38:36,140
do with a lot in this case it is a

888
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:40,880
case that is a world  As when they were

889
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:46,019
installed exactly the same and the

890
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:48,119
area is there and it goes to the telephone number of

891
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:51,900
payment and in this case the normality

892
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,270
is us the link of permissions that

893
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:56,099
we have very controlled as those of

894
00:38:56,099 --> 00:38:58,650
access to the sms is the geta count the

895
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:00,270
access to the  phone call

896
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:03,180
we have all those very closely watched and

897
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,950
logically if a new permission appears

898
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:07,740
in malicious applications that is

899
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,420
very unique, we start to monitor it

900
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,940
, that is, it is not a very common permission

901
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,980
because we began to visit it also in

902
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,170
this case the application had in the

903
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:18,619
title  of the word sex

904
00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:21,369
for no

905
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,390
video

906
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:27,819
h so far everything normal

907
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:32,260
[Applause]

908
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:36,130
but the permissions

909
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:39,550
in the name of the permissions had

910
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,860
the deck at the bottom that at least  Better not

911
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,270
what you want than an application that

912
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:46,890
works for the porn of the calls

913
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:52,260
and well

914
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:59,790
in four in some videos hd movie

915
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:02,430
videos this way of life a form of sex

916
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:06,049


917
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:17,450
well combinations well nothing is already hd videos

918
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:21,129
now you like to see more  to choose

919
00:40:23,369 --> 00:40:27,180
well we open the first one and we go to the

920
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,839


921
00:40:28,839 --> 00:40:32,060
precise permissions of the mattress we are going to also put

922
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:35,690
that we search in google place nothing else and if

923
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:37,099
we go to the files backwards it is the

924
00:40:37,099 --> 00:40:40,190
reverse and the library to use to

925
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:43,190
make the calls is is here

926
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:46,400
you see  There it is called a day it is worth

927
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,380
using a library to make the

928
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,720
calls with that using the permission

929
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,920
that has been granted during the

930
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,230
installation and this what we do is that we

931
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:56,900
say the uniqueness applications with

932
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,369
the permission of the mattress that you use in

933
00:40:58,369 --> 00:40:59,510
this library and  that they are in google

934
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,339
plate please here right now

935
00:41:01,339 --> 00:41:04,250
present that thousands happened to be like this and

936
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:06,200
these last two have been uploaded new

937
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,530
and they are not from the scam but they use those

938
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:12,290
same libs  You would laugh for good things but

939
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:14,089
if we go down we have the

940
00:41:14,089 --> 00:41:16,550
remaining eight that are used for the scam,

941
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:19,670
notice that it has videos of accessing a

942
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,470
million recipes that was a

943
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,790
recipe application some family member at

944
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:25,509
some time

945
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,190
and nobody

946
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,700
did not

947
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:35,210
and a movie or a movie or  of

948
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:38,480
nursery rhymes a friend for your

949
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,840
child

950
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,619
so good to

951
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:48,920
install applications you have to be

952
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,749
very careful is one of the complaints

953
00:41:51,749 --> 00:41:53,999
that I personally have with the

954
00:41:53,999 --> 00:41:56,400
android security system that a

955
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,680
person during the installation has to

956
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,089
know what all the

957
00:42:00,089 --> 00:42:02,339
permissions mean  that you are granting one by

958
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:04,289
one when you enlist your phone seems

959
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:06,480
the smartest thing to do for the

960
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,480
normal user of course to me if I have to

961
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,740
say all the admired all the

962
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,900
permissions I would not be able to know if you

963
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,519
can do something good it can be something

964
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:15,990
malicious our obligation is  that with

965
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:20,910
three permissions on the phone that in

966
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:23,039
a more efficient way to manage

967
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:24,630
security for mobile operating system  vile

968
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:27,559
nowadays

969
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:34,760
all the investigations that there are more

970
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,300
today we have taken another investigation

971
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:40,850
we have organized with a group of

972
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:43,040
applications that sent sms are well

973
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,230
using the roberts javascript libraries

974
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:48,200
that what they do is sit down

975
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,840
one out of seven times and generate you use

976
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,000
the permissions of  Wake-up calls

977
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,260
to be with you all the time

978
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:56,540
until you install it, that is, there are a

979
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,640
lot of different tricks that

980
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,140
each of the applications are using,

981
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:03,530
what we try is how to detect sooner

982
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:04,070


983
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:06,650
we are not going to discover them soon we are

984
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,050
not trying to be an antivirus  And a

985
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:12,290
rating system only what we

986
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:14,150
do is a platform that will choose

987
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:16,490
to monitor what is happening to

988
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:19,940
detect things as soon as

989
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,400
possible and once we have

990
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,650
it, what we have done is add another

991
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:26,600
piece of technology that also  we have

992
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,610
developed that it is also open

993
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:30,620
short and is published in the

994
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,960
community version on the internet you can work

995
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,070
With it, what is this?

996
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:36,500
Is winston called a symphony without

997
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,110
putting it? It is a tool that allows us to

998
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:43,870
take the power of these to process

999
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:46,520
huge amounts of

1000
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,990
information sources that are sometimes

1001
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:50,810
information or without on the internet and again it

1002
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:53,990
will be private information to mix and

1003
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:57,950
process it  and for that we use a

1004
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:00,290
graphic design interface that shows you

1005
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:03,140
the time for security analysts

1006
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,030
can use these three components

1007
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:07,250
the first is a spot that is a

1008
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:09,140
proponent that connects to a

1009
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:11,270
data source that can be an rss a

1010
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:14,390
call to a  de huelva jason

1011
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:17,180
xml files a call a very brief a call

1012
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:20,420
something that you want this is what they

1013
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,370
are doing is taking

1014
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:24,950
constant reality information from the repository that

1015
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:26,960
you have connected to your

1016
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,140
information topology once it arrives within

1017
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:32,120
the stones platform.  you put into

1018
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,820
this we are going to process them with volts and

1019
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:35,540
the bots

1020
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,160
what they do is from each source of

1021
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,870
information as in the end this is  a

1022
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:40,590


1023
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:43,470
data stream a continuous flow of data so

1024
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:45,510
that selecting the pieces second

1025
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:46,800
lifting one of us is processing

1026
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,780
and you can use it to

1027
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,340
mix it with whatever you want the

1028
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:52,350
barriers because when I went with

1029
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:54,300
reputation databases with your own

1030
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,070
mail database  electronic with

1031
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:58,860
peace searches in 9 en is with what

1032
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:00,900
you want the processes as many times

1033
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,760
as you want and as many times in parallel

1034
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,310
as you want you can enter data

1035
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:08,040
from three sources, mix them and then

1036
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,560
divide and drag out

1037
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,500
output results tricks and at the end  when they have just been

1038
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,880
processed with the bots

1039
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,710
you take out the greim which are the places

1040
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:20,630
where you deposit the information that

1041
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:22,160
you can a database a

1042
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,290
real time control panel the entry of a

1043
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:26,300
and of that what you want ballet at the

1044
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,160
end of the cinema is  how are you going to put the

1045
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,900
event and these peoples have the

1046
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:34,099
200 components for integrated with

1047
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:37,339
integrated telegraaf pencil are the ones that

1048
00:45:37,339 --> 00:45:39,740
can influence the in the flow d  e your

1049
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:41,780
information technologies with which it

1050
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,220
can be tuned is delivered as it

1051
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:46,849
should with public services such as hacking

1052
00:45:46,849 --> 00:45:49,580
pound or whatever you want is worth and the

1053
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,490
result of nothing more than is to get an

1054
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:54,020
information topology that looks like this,

1055
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:56,510
as you can see, they are little boxes that

1056
00:45:56,510 --> 00:46:00,230
They are the piquito, the rayito and the yarn

1057
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:02,359
where you go making how you want

1058
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:03,950
the information to flow

1059
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:05,690
and you reuse the component

1060
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:09,369
components to process some times they

1061
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,440
processed gay they are the ones with figures and the

1062
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,010
result is ecology and then you take your

1063
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:20,740
parents out of control you have the version is

1064
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:22,810
eating and you can use it this is a

1065
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:26,230
topology that we use

1066
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:28,390
as a test as you can see in this case it is

1067
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:30,760
connected with for 5 of us that is

1068
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,980
here is what we called the project

1069
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:35,380
internally and the grace is that the

1070
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:37,840
connectors make all

1071
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,760
the components are prepared for  that one component to

1072
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,040
another is standard the flow of data in

1073
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,120
such a way that you only have to

1074
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,130
configure them sele  You ccion and then you are

1075
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:46,690
configuring the parameters that you have

1076
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:48,040
to use of each of these

1077
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:51,400
components and in the end the topology

1078
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,060
once done is executed it is processed

1079
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:59,860
in this continuously and you decide

1080
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,900
how to remove it and this for example is a

1081
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:04,950
panel that we made to  the route where

1082
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:07,120
applying what I have told you the machine

1083
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:10,210
learning we had selected all the

1084
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:12,070
applications that we had marked as

1085
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:14,920
malicious from them we

1086
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,410
automatically remove all the links all the

1087
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:19,590
urls we keep the path

1088
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:22,060
simply with the bar and what comes

1089
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:24,520
next and we see  Which are the ones that

1090
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:27,460
are repeated the most? This allows us to have a

1091
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:30,010
database with a new scoring with the

1092
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,630
pads in such a way that within a

1093
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:33,850
filter it will appear and we see if it has

1094
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:37,120
links with similar peace, why,

1095
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,430
because many of the schemes that have

1096
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:41,950
the  the malicious

1097
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:44,050
back-end applications what they do is change the

1098
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:46,000
domain but all the infrastructure of

1099
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,550
the tasks of two has written of the

1100
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:50,290
The components that they are using are

1101
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:52,210
still exactly the same from one

1102
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:54,160
server to another and that's it because we

1103
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,250
did with a technology and it

1104
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,380
feeds us with all

1105
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,839
the cybercrime frameworks that

1106
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:03,519
each of these types are using and in

1107
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:05,529
this case we take it one by one

1108
00:48:05,529 --> 00:48:07,630
Dashboard panel where we can get the maps

1109
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:09,549
to point the IP addresses of

1110
00:48:09,549 --> 00:48:14,840
the Chinese countries and this kind of thing,

1111
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:18,990
good if you want to encourage yourself

1112
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:23,090
to play with this because we

1113
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:25,900
have made

1114
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:29,290
the panel has opened a couple of

1115
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:31,240
contests for us, we now have them available

1116
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,910
on the internet and there is one for like the one we

1117
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:36,280
did last year in which the best

1118
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,340
age integration comes out better the best

1119
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:41,500
age planning only a better idea you know

1120
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,320
that we have the ones used for a thousand

1121
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,100
things

1122
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:47,410
we have it until you have seen the video of

1123
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:49,740
the ones to control  the house bell

1124
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:52,690
I want has seen who has not seen the

1125
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:56,490
video controlling the house bell

1126
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:01,170
now where is it what

1127
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:03,920
always

1128
00:49:08,619 --> 00:49:11,480
this is an example of integra  tion of the

1129
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:15,760
chs with the internet of things

1130
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:22,970
for September

1131
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:26,000
get down

1132
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,560
now

1133
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,320
[Music]

1134
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:33,620
is a free state of his house and he was

1135
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:34,370
from some

1136
00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:37,160
[Music]

1137
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,010
now call

1138
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:41,260
[Music]

1139
00:49:42,759 --> 00:49:44,749
but what will he do at your house at

1140
00:49:44,749 --> 00:49:48,279
three in the  Tomorrow I was trying

1141
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:54,140
because nothing the pay does not work

1142
00:49:57,170 --> 00:50:00,390
this type of this type

1143
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:02,420
of beach idea integrations we are going to

1144
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:05,310
reward the first prize of giving the

1145
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:08,400
five thousand dollars in bitcoins

1146
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:15,710
five thousand dollars in all of America

1147
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:18,920
we give five thousand dollars to the first

1148
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,110
three  One thousand dollars for the second and one thousand

1149
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:22,910
dollars for the third in the integrations

1150
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:25,840
with the and then without putting for the

1151
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:29,750
other two prizes for the best goal, that is,

1152
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:32,090
to the best processing component itself,

1153
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:34,250
we give three thousand dollars

1154
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:37,190
and the best topology the one that does the

1155
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:39,370
the best topology, the most imaginative,

1156
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:42,440
and so on, because we give the three thousand

1157
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,570
dollars too and you have information there, you

1158
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:47,240
don't see something in real because

1159
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:50,480
the screen is cut a bit, but we have opened

1160
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,930
a forum directly in it.  even pads

1161
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:56,120
for him to comment on this

1162
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,569
information

1163
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:05,140
where I am also there

1164
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:09,260
the videos when we are going to do

1165
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:11,510
good we are going to do a training webcast

1166
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:13,120


1167
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:18,110
use them and you can enter and

1168
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:20,150
participate and there you have all the data

1169
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:23,780
of the community community points 55

1170
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,910
million point and  level for background and

1171
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:28,160
there you have information about the

1172
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:32,190
contests imposing documentation on them

1173
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:34,500
and it goes further

1174
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:39,330
to quickly summarize the session that

1175
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:42,330
had already passed time created the number

1176
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:43,860
of applications in the world of

1177
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:45,690
cybercrime is large you have to be

1178
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:47,060
very careful every time it is more  difficult to

1179
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:50,670
locate them because they are being more

1180
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:53,730
sibylline if they try to be more hidden

1181
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:55,920
what we try is to locate

1182
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,560
them as quickly and with symphony then

1183
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,360
process and extract the intelligence of an

1184
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,100
exit detect more in the future because

1185
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:04,170
without a doubt while we only remove the

1186
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:06,930
apps  and the bad guys stay at home, they

1187
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:08,880
'll come back and we'll try another

1188
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:09,600
way,

1189
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,360
just like that, thank you very much for h  aber

1190
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,130
endured my talk and I hope you

1191
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:16,280
liked it

1192
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:27,620
today questions come

1193
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:29,420
well two questions someone to ask

1194
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:31,810
some questions

1195
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:36,370
will someone not here there is one that is

1196
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:43,140
where actors yesterday in the middle there are

1197
00:52:45,819 --> 00:52:48,390
how

1198
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:51,990
good we are the free ones that can

1199
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:53,820
be downloaded and the paid ones  we download

1200
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:55,860
all the features and all the

1201
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:58,170
information associated with them

1202
00:52:58,170 --> 00:53:00,210
the skills we have not yet seen

1203
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:05,040
cases of maxwell in the world

1204
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,810
of payment applications there are companies that

1205
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:08,550
use techniques that we do not

1206
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:12,050
like that is the purchase

1207
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:15,240
we do not do that we look for all

1208
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,520
the  applications public information

1209
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,960
and with that we work but because we

1210
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,040
have not yet seen cases of malware

1211
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,520
or targeted attacks that use payments

1212
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:30,840
from those businesses if they are able to

1213
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,610
sell anything for many of these it is

1214
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:34,380
better than what they get for the

1215
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:36,690
advertising they need  much more

1216
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:39,140
work

1217
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:42,890
and my fault

1218
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:48,800
pfeiffer I do not know if we have a

1219
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,460
block in blogspot.com and there they are all

1220
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:55,430
The papers, the channels, the yzr, on YouTube,

1221
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:57,260
we make the web, we almost put it, and the

1222
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:59,420
royal web owes all the

1223
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:02,050
intelligence reports to us,

1224
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:07,530
very well, thanks and so far,

1225
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:09,750
thanks a lot to an abyss that had a

1226
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:11,130
world

1227
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:13,770
after the king, there is a scale in English

1228
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:18,110
so those who do not understand

1229
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:25,190
English well
