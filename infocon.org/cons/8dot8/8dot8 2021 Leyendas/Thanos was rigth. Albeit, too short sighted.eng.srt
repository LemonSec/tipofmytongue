conversation about just some fun things

in the industry as we move through the

34
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,280
industry as we walk through you heard

35
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,159

43
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,400
dug out of a large hole

44
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,159
so without further ado

45
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,760
let's have a conversation so we're going

46
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,080
to talk about about security and we're

47
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,159
going to talk a little bit about the uh

48
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,040
the mcu so a little bit of fun with

thanos and his clicking fingers

50
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,280
uh but before we do that we will have a

51
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,560
little bit of a public service

52
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,120
announcement as i would like to call it

53
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,799
uh for those of you that were looking

54
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,560
for a fun light

55
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,680
pep talk and a hoorah for the industry

56
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,799
this is not going to be that talk uh you

57
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,239
have been warned this is going to be a

58
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,159
very blunt conversation

59
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,080
about the state of the industry what is

60
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,599
going on in the industry and what we

61
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,720
need to do about it

62
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,560
um so for those of you that know me my

63
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,159
squirrel moment is over

64
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,200
and we're gonna have a little bit of a

65
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,360
conversation with the agenda so we're

66
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,879
going to talk about what is going on

67
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,399
with the security industry

68
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,079
not just in north america but europe

69
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,720
obviously south america

70
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,479
and other areas around we're also going

71
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,880
to talk about why we need to change

72
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,479
how we're approaching the industry why

73
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,680
we need to have a different look at

74
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,800
things

75
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,320
and we'll probably break a few things

76
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,880
along the way and kind of go from there

77
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,560
uh the hairy thing that is in front of

78
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,560
you my beard is not as colored as it

79
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,960
normally is for that as i apologize

80
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,320
my background is obviously as a

81
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,639
researcher a father to both two-legged

82
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,240
ones i have my daughter upstairs asleep

83
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,600
because it is early in the morning for

84
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,560
here

85
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,759
i got the four-legged ones running

86
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,600
around a geek and then yes

87
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,880
the hacker and i wear that very very

88
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,240
proudly

89
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,560
so let's have a conversation uh let's

90
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,400
talk about why are we failing so

91
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,680
and we'll have the conversation about

92
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,680
why i think we're failing but if we're

93
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,440
failing let's talk about the humans this

94
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,199
is nothing to do with technology

95
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,800
this has got nothing to do with any of

96
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,960
the procedures this is about the humans

97
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,280
ourselves and when i talk about the

98
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,360
humans ourselves let's take ourselves

99
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,520
back to the early days when we were kids

100
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,440
when we had parents or guardians or

101
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,360
somebody was looking after us

102
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,120
when we first started and when we first

103
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,280
started not even in the industry

104
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,039
the first time we came into the kitchen

105
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,720
the parents what did they say to us they

106
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,039
said

107
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,199
don't touch the kettle it's hot don't

108
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,120
touch the stove it's on

109
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,000
and what did we do we touched it we put

110
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,039
our hand out

111
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,840
and we got burnt and then later on in

112
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,440
life oops i've missed the later on in

113
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,039
life later on in life

114
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,120
we did this we all thought this was a

115
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,479
good idea we all as

116
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,039
kids were like ah this will be wonderful

117
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,240
until we ended up

118
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,800
wrapping ourselves around a tree and as

119
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,680
adults

120
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,800
this is us not just us in the industry

121
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,639
but these are the very people that we're

122
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,840
trying to look at and look after

123
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,039
so if we think about that and then we

124
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,160
think about our work

125
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,319
on the work that we're doing this is

126
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,080
every single red team engagement

127
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,400
i've been doing this now for the best

128
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,240
part of 40 years minus jumping out of

129
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,000
airplanes for the military

130
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,199
and i'm not on one occasion have we been

131
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,520
unable to actually break into something

132
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,639
every single time

133
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,400
we can get in so this really is the

134
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,319
state of our industry on this one

135
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,080
so then we have to take a step back and

136
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,319
go well we've thrown technology at it

137
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,160
for so many years

138
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,039
will technology fix it and the question

139
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,880
on will technology fix it and here's a

140
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,319
little bit of the answer unfortunately

141
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,360
for this one

142
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,479
we take a look at the amount of

143
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,000
passwords that we have we take a look at

144
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,840
where we're going on passwords

145
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,240
and this password one two three four

146
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,880
five six

147
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,120
is still the number one password that we

148
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,960
deal with not only is one through six

149
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,479
the number password but if you decide

150
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,400
you fancy having a little bit of fun

151
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,240
with the us congress you can put all

152
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,080
ones into some of the user accounts to

153
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,280
still get in although

154
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,039
for those of you that are following us

155
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,199

you know we as a society and we as

161
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,840
people are

162
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,120
charging down the way of technology yet

163
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,479
we're still facing these levels of

164
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,919
passwords

165
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,680

and british writers and some british

171
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,039
humor on this one

172
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,880
we have the conversation from douglas

173
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,720
adams which is any time that the

174
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,720
civilization gets to a point where it

175
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,319
has to put instructions

176
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,400
on the inside of toothpicks this is

177
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,000
where we have to have a bit of a change

178
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,479
and then we have to look at the very

179
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,879
people that we are trying to protect so

180
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,400
again our industry is all about

181
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,759
protecting people or it should be all

182
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,280
about protecting people

183
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,680
and when we have to put signs like this

184
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,400
up

185
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,960
around the zoos or around other areas

186
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,960
then we really have to take a step back

187
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,560
and go hmm

188
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,639
we should change our approach we should

189
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,080
look at doing something different

190
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,440
in this industry but if you

191
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,199
listen to the very people in our

192
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,680
industry everybody's charging off down

193
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,720
this well i've got

194
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,960
cyber and if you look at it from the

195
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,800
perspective of the attackers so the

196
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,720
adversaries the attackers

197
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,800
the the folks that are actually breaking

198
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,879
in and not legitimately breaking in

199
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,958
if you look at the how organized how

200
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,399
well put together they are the

201
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,320
technologies that they have the tools

202
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,279
that they have

203
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,039
to move the screen just a little bit so

204
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,120
you can actually see what's going on

205
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,760
just a bit

206
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,440
you look at the tools and the technology

207
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,760
that they have and the time that they

208
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,240
have and the patients that they have

209
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,040
they have as it shows a much bigger and

210
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,720
a much more effective toolbox

211
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,040
than anybody on the defensive side which

212
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,480
typically means from the attackers

213
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,680
perspective

214
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,800
it's easy hunting and it's easy fishing

215
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,720
so then you know we take a couple of

216
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,240
examples from this there were a number

217
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,680
of us that got brought into

218
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,080
uh beginning of this year it was a

219
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,760
capture the flag it was an invite only

220
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,040
capture the flag

221
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,440
and we basically were given a target it

222
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,040
was a fully patched windows 10

223
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,200
environment with endpoint detection on

224
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,760
it

225
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,519
all sorts of software and all sorts of

226
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,880
detection stuff on it and a whole bunch

227
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,920
of other things in front of

228
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,519
it and it was sitting on top of the

229
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,600
virtual machine

230
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,360
we knew going into it what we would be

231
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,200
facing how would we facing it

232
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,640
and as you can see you can read the

233
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,480
stats as well as i can once we got into

234
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,440
the system

235
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,320
it was 68 seconds to break past the

236
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,720
windows 10 environment bypass the

237
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,240
endpoint detection system and take

238
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,839
control of their metal

239
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,920
it was too easy and so that was the

240
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,440
state of technology then and it hasn't

241
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,959
really moved on from now

242
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,480
so then we have to go back in history

243
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,240
and look at how nortons cannot obviously

244
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,519
protect you even then

245
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,279
so then we look at the defensive teams

246
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
we have to take a look at where we have

247
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,640
been

248
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,880
we take a look at the the people on the

249
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,480
blue team side of the fence the purple

250
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,680
team side of the fence

251
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,040
and where they are today and quite

252
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,640
honestly it's not pretty as it says in

253
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,360
here

254
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,920
arguably less tools or even if they have

255
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,279
all the tools

256
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,279
they're not using them effectively

257
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,640
they're actually still some of them are

258
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,240
still chasing for more technology some

259
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,800
of them have

260
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,279
time to implement them properly and not

261
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,720
only do we have to worry about the tools

262
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,160
but we also have to put policies

263
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,279
procedures

264
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,040
and controls in place so we have to

265
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,200
justify exactly what we're doing

266
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,120
and then also typically we're doing with

267
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,640
politics we're having to worry about

268
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,560
various other things and often with less

269
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,839
resources

270
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,959
so um this unfortunately is where we

271
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,640
come to when it comes to the defensive

272
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,040
side of the world

273
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,079
now for those of you that believe your

274
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:44,800
vendors

275
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,200
and you believe them without questioning

276
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,959
the vendor apparently keeps telling us

277
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,399
we're going to be secure

278
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,959
the vendor keeps using hooded images and

279
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,560
to tell us that they can keep you

280
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,680
100 secure that they have anti-hacking

281
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,640
solutions

282
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,560
and we aren't going to question them

283
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,920
something we'll talk about in a little

284
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,880
bit

285
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,440
so here is what i say you do to your

286
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,279
vendors that keep telling you that they

287
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,880
can keep you secure

288
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,680
now we are going to need a few more

289
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,800
cartridges because

290
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,839
this is the state of the security market

291
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,000
so again if you put yourself in the

292
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,200
shoes

293
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,720
of the very people we're trying to

294
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,320
protect they have

295
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,240
all of these companies that they're now

296
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,519
trying to figure out

297
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,600
who can do the right thing for me who

298
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,440
can do the right end point or the right

299
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,600
technology or the right defensive system

300
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,000
or the right intelligence platform

301
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,440
and the companies themselves aren't

302
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,360
helping the situation because everyone

303
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,880
every single one of them

304
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,399
keeps saying hey we can all do

305
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,640
everything perfectly and so

306
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,480
part of our challenge and part of the

307
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,560
work we need to do in this industry

308
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,160
is sort this bloody mess out more

309
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
effectively

310
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,959
now let's have a conversation about our

311
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,040
industry

312
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,600
this is what i do not like our business

313
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,959
is booming

314
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,800
we have a lot going on there's money

315
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
flowing in and unfortunately it keeps

316
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,519
moving

317
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,920
which means we keep rewarding the bad

318
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,519
behavior

319
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,600
we are spending more and more money i

320
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,079
mean it's crazy the amount of money that

321
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,440
we've spent in this industry

322
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,560
last year alone 124 billion us dollars

323
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,720
was spent in the industry now

324
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,880
some of it was for legacy systems some

325
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,320
of it was for

326
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,760
you know software and hardware and

327
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,360
systems that we have to maintain and

328
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,800
that we have inherited et cetera et

329
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,639
cetera but a lot of it unfortunately has

330
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,560
been spent on newer technology which

331
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,040
means in theory we should be winning

332
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,120
but unfortunately we're not even close

333
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,240
to winning

334
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,959
so this is where we're expecting to see

335
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,360
damages hit by 2021 now i've seen some

336
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,800
stuff throwing around in the newspaper

337
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,480
which is oh we're already here and we've

338
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,680
already done it and

339
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,360
i'm still not entirely certain i'd love

340
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,240
to see some more material behind this

341
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,040
but if we take a look at the statistics

342
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,160
that we have in

343
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,480
our industry now and this is a mix from

344
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,279
like ponymon the feds from the verizon

345
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,079
report

346
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,160
uh ibm and a couple of other reports all

347
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,360
put together

348
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,600
the amount of time it takes us to even

349
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,720
detect

350
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,560
that somebody is inside a system

351
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,959
averages out about 197 days it's all

352
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:11,760
over the place

353
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,040
it's everywhere from like 90 days up to

354
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,040
a thousand plus days you know if you're

355
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,639
yahoo or somebody

356
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,320
we're not good at doing anything on this

357
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,160
one then recovering so when you

358
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,320
know that you found me inside your

359
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,279
environment

360
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,880
then it's going to take you another two

361
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,240
months to actually get me the hell out

362
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,920
of your environment

363
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,519
for those of you that know me part of my

364
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,600
background is doing research and a lot

365
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,839
of work in the deception space

366
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,760
so i do a lot to work in that one which

367
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,440
actually starts to affect those top two

368
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:39,920
figures

369
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,480
quite significantly then we look at the

370
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,760
amount of companies that are being

371
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,199
fished the amount of companies that have

372
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,160
had a breach

373
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,760
the cost of the breaches i mean those

374
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,839
numbers are again all over the place

375
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,279
part of the problem in our industry is

376
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,760
we don't even have a clear set of

377
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,399
numbers to go against we keep talking

378
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,760
about all these numbers but we don't

379
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,440
actually have one good set to go against

380
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,480
which is a problem

381
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,160
the worst one for me is the fact that

382
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,160
we're losing so much data

383
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,320
that's a global number so 22 million

384
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,240
records a day is a global number so

385
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,000
you know all over the world as far as

386
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,519
i'm concerned and those numbers are

387
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,560
fairly significant unfortunately

388
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,600
if you tally up and you add up

389
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,000
the top 30 breaches that we have had

390
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,959
globally

391
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,480
it's almost double the earth's

392
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,320
population so if nothing else we're

393
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,040
extremely

394
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,800
thorough at making sure that we lose

395
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,839
everybody's data

396
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,560
twice and then we look at when we fail

397
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,959
then we look at even how we managed to

398
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,519
make a profit even when we fail so

399
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,000
i've sold you equipment and i've taken

400
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,959
your money

401
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,240
and then i've taken your money to

402
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,920
maintain it and manage it i've taken

403
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,760
your money to penetrate test it and to

404
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,560
assess it

405
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,320
i've taken more money to put policies

406
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,680
and controls around it

407
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,920
and then when the whole thing fails and

408
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,600
you get ransomwared

409
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,600
i take even more money from you to try

410
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,800
to fix them around somewhere and repay

411
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,959
repave in the first place

412
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,720
we're terrible how the hell

413
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,680
do we succeed

414
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,720
this is the state of our industry

415
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,839
it's not good

416
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,839
if you want to add extra things into

417
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,199
here as well for those of you that are

418
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,360
science fiction fans

419
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,480
this sums it up perfectly we're erratic

420
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,760
conflicted and disorganized we lack

421
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,399
harmony

422
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,759
and cohesion and greatness it will be

423
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:30,560
and currently

424
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,720
is our undoing now on top of this

425
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,880
just to add a little bit more on top of

426
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,120
this we have alert fatigue

427
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,959
you guys can read the statistics as well

428
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,279
as i can so we have put

429
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,360
technology into the hands of the people

430
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,120
that we're meant to protect

431
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,320
that they can't effectively manage

432
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,000
we've put technology into the hands i

433
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,959
mean i've done it we were on a

434
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,000
penetration test

435
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,560
not that long ago and we'd gotten in and

436
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,680
we were sitting there

437
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,720
and the managed service provider hadn't

438
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,240
noticed that we were there

439
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,639
so we started to make some more noise we

440
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,880
started to like ramp up the noise

441
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,639
and they saw us and they categorized as

442
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,000
something so like okay we're going to

443
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,519
really make some noise we fired up

444
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,079
something called

445
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,959
angry ip scanner angry ip scanner for

446
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,320
those of you that don't know what it is

447
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,240
it's basically it's it's a scanning

448
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,839
software it basically looks at every

449
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,160
single port or specific ports across the

450
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,279
network and it does it

451
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,759
loud and proud it's like standing in the

452
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:26,959
middle of a library

453
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,519
with a loudspeaker yelling at the top of

454
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,959
your voice somebody's going to pay

455
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:31,440
attention

456
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,800
they did after they tuned the system

457
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,519
down

458
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,040
they then said oh it's it's a bad

459
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,480
network card don't worry about it we'll

460
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,079
fix it in a couple of days and we were

461
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:40,480
like

462
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,040
we give up and so this is where we have

463
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,639
the problems even in our entry when we

464
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,000
put the tools

465
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,839
that should be doing the detection we

466
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,199
haven't tuned them or we haven't done an

467
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,800
effective enough job to actually help

468
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,199
the organizations understand

469
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,199
so then the challenge then becomes how

470
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,399
do you help a company

471
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,720
understand that it's not an if it's not

472
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,920
the fact that you've built all this

473
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,519
technology in place and oh they'll be

474
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,959
perfectly safe which is what they think

475
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,319
they're like well why am i spending this

476
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,079
money

477
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,319
we don't explain it effectively we don't

478
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,880
talk about it as a journey or a path or

479
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,400
a way that we're trying to do things we

480
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,839
say oh it's okay it's fine

481
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,880
we as our industry have to take a step

482
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,760
back

483
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,359
and we have to look at what we're doing

484
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,480
what we're doing right and what we're

485
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,839
doing wrong and unfortunately we're

486
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,359
doing more things wrong we are

487
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,200
definitely led by marketing messages

488
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,280
when i first started this industry we're

489
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,960
talking a long long time ago we were led

490
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,160
by innovation

491
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,559
we were led by people who had passion

492
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,559
who had desire who wanted to see

493
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,640
change you just listened to an amazing

494
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,880
talk by eff which was taught by eva

495
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,799
which were talking about change and

496
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,400
wanting the passion back into this

497
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,919
industry to help people

498
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,039
and help society get better but we don't

499
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,799
do that we spend much more money on

500
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,640
marketing messages to try to confuse

501
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,600
everybody

502
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,679
then we charge down the latest buzzwords

503
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:58,880
so it doesn't matter if it's

504
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,160
ai or machine learning or picky buzz or

505
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,559
you know endpoint detection etc etc

506
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,400
we'll go charging down this in the hope

507
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,480
that we can make some more money on it

508
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,960
we're not focused on protecting we don't

509
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,320
care about protecting

510
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,240
we focus much more on making profits and

511
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,480
for me that's a shame there's so many

512
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,840
in this community and you know that's

513
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,200
why i love talking at these even if it

514
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,120
is a crazy hour of the morning

515
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,200
because we have a community and so many

516
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,559
of us want to see

517
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,120
change but we have to be able to affect

518
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,039
it something we'll talk about

519
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,120
and unfortunately you know we haven't

520
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,400
evolved

521
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,160
for the right reasons we've evolved to

522
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,919
make a lot of people some people a lot

523
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:36,559
of money

524
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,320
and not necessarily to protect people

525
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,720
effectively so we have created

526
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,960
an exceedingly good breeding ground for

527
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,160
an attacker to succeed

528
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,240
not for us to be able to do things as

529
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,080
well as we want to

530
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,400
so this is about where we are really

531
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,080
when we look at it let's face it we have

532
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,520
actually not just got a bit of a [ __ ]

533
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,559
show we've actually set it on fire

534
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,080
so what do we do how do we actually do

535
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,200
something about this and we have some

536
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,919
options

537
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,760
this isn't just to do this or us we have

538
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,440
a couple of options we can

539
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,480
go all thanos

540
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,720
now what i mean by this is if you look

541
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,559
at where technology is and you look at

542
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,760
the work that's being in doing the

543
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,760
technology especially in healthcare

544
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,320
especially in biotechnology especially

545
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,080
nano and embedded technology

546
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,600
especially technology and critical

547
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,120
infrastructure we

548
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,919
are at a point so even a maybe or a

549
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,919
possibility we are at a point where we

550
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,520
affect actual humans

551
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,480
when we screw up it is no longer just

552
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,000
reboot the computer

553
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
it is when we screw up in healthcare

554
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,120
people die

555
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,200
when we screw up by ransomware in these

556
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,880
places people die we've already had

557
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,559
examples we've already had potential

558
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,360
examples

559
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,120
the us and the club in europe is going

560
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,160
through it at the moment with a whole

561
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,520
bunch more healthcare attacks that are

562
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,480
going on

563
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,240
people are suffering so you take that

564
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,160
extrapolate that out even further

565
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,320
we kill more people unfortunately

566
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,240
especially in the united states

567
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,640
people only pay attention when more and

568
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,919
more and more people die

569
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,760
and more bodies pile up so we have that

570
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,720
option it is a bit drastic

571
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,559
especially very very drastic when you

572
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,320
turn three and a half billion people

573
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,159
into nothing more than dust bodies

574
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,400
the other problem with this as well is

575
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,720
phallus was very short-sighted

576
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,679
um i grew up i mean i was born in the

577
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:20,480
70s

578
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,799
so when i was born the world's

579
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,720
population was only about three and a

580
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,360
half billion

581
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,840
fast forward almost 50 years were seven

582
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,039
and a half billion

583
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,360
so we would literally have to kill off

584
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,440
half the population of the planet every

585
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,919
50 years just to keep people's attention

586
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,440
not sure it's a good thing to do but

587
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,080
it's an option it's out there especially

588
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,159
the way we're turning to technology

589
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,520
especially if we look at healthcare i

590
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,039
mean this is just you know the last four

591
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,400
years with healthcare the amount of

592
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,400
places that are being hit the amount of

593
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,080
systems that are being attacked

594
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,480
the overwhelming amount of machines and

595
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,840
people and everything else that are

596
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,440
being affected on this

597
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,440
and the costs that go with it it's um

598
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,520
it's pretty substantial

599
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,000
and as i said when we get it wrong at

600
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,919
this point in time when we screw up

601
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:04,960
people die it

602
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,480
there's no even question about this at

603
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,320
this point in time it's no longer

604
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,919
reboot the computer will be fine it's oh

605
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,159
that icu system just went online as

606
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,000
ransomware the person couldn't get

607
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,760
to the hospital on time because of

608
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,280
ransomware there are

609
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,120
too many examples of this where we're

610
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,799
seeing this so this is no longer

611
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,960
us just screwing around with computers

612
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,640
these are people's lives that we're

613
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,480
affecting

614
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,159
and this was that ransomware attack

615
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,679
unfortunately where we were talking

616
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:32,559
about you know

617
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,720
um this was several weeks ago and i said

618
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,320
16 hours this is several weeks ago where

619
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,760
we were talking about this

620
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,600
where you know it wasn't just the first

621
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,039
one we've had one of pride we've had a

622
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,240
whole bunch of other things how many

623
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,000
people do all through stress so

624
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,360
it's not good now option number two

625
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,960
we've all been charging down the

626
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,400
technology arena and looking at

627
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,559
artificial intelligence so

628
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,559
there is a part of me i will admit that

629
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,320
she wants the machines to take over

630
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:56,960
because as

631
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,919
humans we suck i mean we're terrible

632
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:00,320
we're

633
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,559
not good with looking after each other

634
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,159
we're terrible between different

635
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,840
countries about how we help people or

636
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,919
ignore people unfortunately

637
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,919
and we tend to have too many biases we

638
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,159
really tend to have too many biases so

639
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,760
let's let the machines take over as far

640
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,280
as i'm concerned

641
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,440
now there's a bit of a problem with that

642
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,880
we haven't got quite the machines where

643
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,960
we want them this comes off of so i

644
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,559
i'm very fortunate i live in a nice

645
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,960
house um you saw one of the dogs come in

646
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,000
a minute ago

647
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,840
we have the roombas we have we have a

648
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,280
couple of roombas running around the

649
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,000
house

650
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
um cleaning up you know all the dog hair

651
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,520
and stuff like that so apparently

652
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,799
according to roomba

653
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,039
it has advanced decision making

654
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,159
capabilities

655
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,960
powered by artificial intelligence it's

656
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,720
capable of scanning a room

657
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,640
remembering things sorting out and

658
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,960
everything well no no it doesn't

659
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,440
this is artificial intelligence in

660
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,240
action

661
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,320
this is exactly where the bloody rumba

662
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,400
gets stuck day after day after day no

663
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,840
matter what i do the stupid thing ends

664
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,440
up getting stuck but it eats the carpet

665
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,880
and it goes to try to hide under the

666
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,679
side

667
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,080
so and if you look on top of this this

668
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,880
is actually a fairly modern example

669
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,520
when we look at how that intelligence

670
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,480
system is

671
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,960
able to categorize imagery is able to

672
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,480
mess around with them we look at us from

673
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,840
the hacking community

674
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,520
at how we can mess with it so on the

675
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,600
left hand side you have basically a

676
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,559
picture of a pig

677
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,280
great wonderful now you manipulate that

678
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,000
image by

679
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,240
you know by literally less than one half

680
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,360
of a percent

681
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,120
and all of a sudden the actual

682
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,120
intelligence system classifies that pick

683
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,720
as an airline

684
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,760
this is where we get into adversarial

685
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,720
machine learning

686
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,280
adversarial intelligence so if you think

687
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,159
about it

688
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,000
artificial intelligence is typically

689
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,400
very very dependent

690
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,720
on the data but it's learning from and

691
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,640
how often that data refreshes how often

692
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,320
that data is used

693
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,400
et cetera et cetera et cetera if you can

694
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,159
poison the well

695
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,880
and actually put your own data into that

696
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,799
data source it's learning from

697
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,960
all of a sudden you now influence the

698
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,799
outcome of some of these decisions so

699
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,159
perfect example

700
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,320
um i don't think clown strike is

701
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,080
supporting us who do we have we are palo

702
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,840
alto tenor will naysay mcafee

703
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,760
all right i can annoy clown strike so

704
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,200
plan strike is a good example of this

705
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,640
one same thing with doctorates those are

706
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,400
two organizations that rely very very

707
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,880
heavily on on artificial intelligence

708
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,480
now if you can get to the source of the

709
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,159
data which is possible and you can

710
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,520
poison it and you can do all sorts of

711
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,880
interesting stuff with it

712
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,320
all of a sudden the machines it's

713
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,320
protecting become the machines it wants

714
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:28,880
to attack

715
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,799
and defend against so you basically

716
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,400
induce a self-attack on systems it's

717
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,799
kind of fun to do

718
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,559
so for good measures apart from making

719
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,440
pigs fly as it says adversarial machine

720
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:39,919
learning

721
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,919
uh it really is the new frontier of what

722
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,360
we're doing for those of you that are in

723
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,799
the industry are looking to advance in

724
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,880
the industry take a long

725
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,080
hard look at how companies and

726
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,279
organizations are

727
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,919
using large quantities of data to make

728
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,840
decisions and then look at the attack

729
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,799
vectors

730
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,559
that you can insert across those and

731
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,640
please have some fun with that

732
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,320
so as it says despite what the vendor

733
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,919
say ai is not

734
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,840
going to save us just yet it won't

735
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,520
exactly be the downfall of us but it

736
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,640
isn't there yet

737
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,159
now we could just keep going down the

738
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,919
same route that we've been doing i mean

739
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,919
we obviously have that option and here

740
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,120
it is

741
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,720
head in the sand and we all know how

742
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,320
well that works we are going off the

743
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,600
edge of the cliff we're going off the

744
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:23,919
air

745
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,440
the cliff at full speed or

746
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,960
we try something new we take a different

747
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,960
approach to this we take a little bit of

748
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,000
a look at this and see what we can do

749
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,919
we can take a step away from the

750
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,919
technology and we can look at how

751
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,919
we interact with each other we can look

752
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,080
at how we communicate with people and

753
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,919
exchange ideas again

754
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,240
what i love about this community is we

755
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,600
have you know 8.8

756
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,880
10 years old this year okay 10 years

757
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,880
of working with the community we have

758
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,799
the b-sides community

759
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,880
which again is amazing all over the

760
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,960
country we have all these areas where we

761
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,120
can exchange ideas with each other

762
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,480
and we can influence um we have

763
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,000
cooperation

764
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,200
the ability to actually share the data

765
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,039
and this is a very very crucial one and

766
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,039
share in a timely fashion that's a huge

767
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:15,440
one

768
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,600
we can coordinate effectively we can all

769
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,360
actually work together for a common

770
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,000
course

771
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,440
as opposed to all of us behind the

772
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,799
scenes pulling in different directions

773
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,159
we're going through some challenges at

774
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:25,120
the moment

775
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,720
um and i've got to be honest i'm kind of

776
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,240
pissed off with some of the some of the

777
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,840
people in our industry

778
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,279
because we're having problems with

779
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,720
healthcare and there's a number of

780
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,520
amazing people

781
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,840
evan frankfort ryan fortier and some

782
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,600
other amazing people of other companies

783
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,960
that are actually doing some amazing

784
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,320
work to try and figure out what's going

785
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,039
on

786
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,480
and then you get some people which are

787
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,480
holding on to information and don't want

788
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,600
to share

789
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,440
that's when i start getting pissed off

790
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,760
because we need to collaborate much more

791
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,039
effectively

792
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,760
so uh a shout out to some people in our

793
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,559
industry that are holding on to

794
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:58,799
427 hospitals worth of information

795
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,919
share your [ __ ] um krebs i hope you're

796
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,840
listening to this

797
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,559
all right when we talk to people

798
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,960
when we have conversations with

799
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,919
companies

800
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,880
when we engage with companies think

801
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,520
about it

802
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,200
think about it not just in your shoes

803
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,880
but think about it from the company

804
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,039
if somebody was to walk up to you and

805
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,399
somebody was to have a conversation with

806
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:23,600
you go hi

807
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,200
i'm chris i'm gonna penetrate you

808
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,399
what the hell are you gonna do i'm not

809
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,559
only gonna penetrate you i'm gonna

810
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:31,679
penetrate you

811
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,840
with a piece of software named after the

812
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,120
goddess of death and destruction

813
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,760
doesn't sound very inviting doesn't

814
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,360
sound very nice and not only am i gonna

815
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,000
do that

816
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,159
i'm gonna penetrate you with pineys

817
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,640
pineapples and ponies and you're like

818
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,159
what the hell are you talking about

819
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,520
that is not the way to do it

820
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,840
how about walking up to the people that

821
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,120
you want to engage with

822
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,799
how about walking up to somebody you

823
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,640
just want to help understand security

824
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,720
how about walking into that next client

825
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,000
engagement with

826
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,480
tea or coffee in one hand and donuts or

827
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,159
pastries in the other hand and sitting

828
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,520
down going

829
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,200
can we have a conversation can we

830
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,960
talk can we role play can we engage in

831
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,880
discussion

832
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,880
much more collaborative much more

833
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,520
engaged the barrier comes down you're

834
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,320
not

835
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,679
in an adversarial relationship

836
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,240
and here's what i mean and again i'll

837
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,840
take this as english but for those of

838
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,559
you that follow

839
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,880
xkcd i know he does these books in other

840
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,840
language

841
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,000
so talk in a language that others

842
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,960
understand

843
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,799
in other words you know you're in chile

844
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,000
when you are talking

845
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,120
with your clients don't talk in code

846
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,440
don't talk in acronyms talk in spanish

847
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,960
have a plain and simple conversation

848
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,080
with them

849
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,120
don't talk in geek speak but explain

850
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,000
what we're doing

851
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,600
in a language that others are

852
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,360
comfortable with and others understand

853
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,960
this comes back to training

854
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,720
so for those of you that follow me i do

855
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,640
a lot of work with the wiser team so

856
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,440
wiser

857
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,760
we do a lot of education work and we do

858
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,919
it in plain and simple language and it's

859
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:14,720
free

860
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,399
you know there is a ton of free training

861
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,080
out there the wiser training site

862
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,000
i've even got a compendium i've got a

863
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,600
dictionary where we break

864
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,480
down how technical terms are going to

865
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,760
english take them

866
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,760
translate them to spanish please in fact

867
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,240
i think we do some of the languages

868
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,240
but we need to be the ones that come to

869
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,840
the table and talk more effectively with

870
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,640
others

871
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,200
the other thing we need to do is ask

872
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,840
more

873
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,159
questions we also need to help the

874
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,440
people around us

875
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,320
ask more questions and i have them help

876
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,640
understand what's going on with security

877
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,799
have them understand what's happening in

878
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,039
this industry

879
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,080
this is a big shout out devsecops

880
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,840
whether you like the name don't like the

881
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,360
name like what's going on et cetera et

882
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,080
cetera

883
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,520
to me this is where we have

884
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,600
collaboration this is where we have

885
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,600
development teams security teams and

886
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,799
operational teams

887
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,279
working together a big shout out for

888
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,200
like mark miller on the devsev ops teams

889
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:09,600
here

890
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,000
they have a conference in two weeks time

891
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,919
there's a hundred and fifty speakers

892
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:14,320
over

893
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,760
24 hours it's completely free it's all

894
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,919
day devops go watch it go listen to it

895
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,279
go engage

896
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,880
go understand how we have to collaborate

897
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,840
more effectively and work together more

898
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,840
effectively break down the barriers

899
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,279
just because we know the development

900
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,559
teams are a pain in the ass and just

901
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,000
because we know operators become a

902
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,720
strange

903
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,120
we're also weird in the middle and we

904
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,720
have to be the ones that go out there

905
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,120
and help

906
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,320
everybody else listen to be more

907
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,720
effective

908
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,640
we gotta share again this is a community

909
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,480
you have so many people here listening

910
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,880
you have so many people here engaged

911
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,960
get to know each other get to understand

912
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,720
this and when you are talking and when

913
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,399
you are basically working with each

914
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:57,360
other

915
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,120
figure out exactly who you can tell

916
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,360
if you get hit or when you get hit with

917
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,840
ransomware or you get hit with an attack

918
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,000
talk to the people around you and help

919
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,159
them protect themselves as well

920
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,080
we shouldn't be waiting for the lawyers

921
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,600
to get engaged and we shouldn't be

922
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,279
waiting before the authorities tell us

923
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,640
we can say something

924
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,720
even if you keep the back channels open

925
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,399
the signal channels and all these other

926
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,080
discussion points open

927
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,919
we should be the ones reaching out and

928
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,279
helping those

929
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,000
around us the only way we get better is

930
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,880
if we work

931
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,720
more effectively as a community it's as

932
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,840
simple as that

933
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,720
oops there's some slides there we go i

934
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,159
think that's the one yep

935
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,919
so there's more on this there's a lot

936
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,120
more on this that we could obviously

937
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,559
have a conversation about

938
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,240
but i want to talk a little bit more

939
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,480
about this one so if we look at our

940
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,320
industry and we look at where we started

941
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,000
it used to be people process and

942
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,320
technology but let's be perfectly honest

943
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,320
um we tended we have forgotten the

944
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,559
people we've looked at technology as

945
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,039
solving these problems and it's not

946
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,880
going to do everything for us it isn't

947
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,760
going to solve the problems unless we

948
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,919
re-engage

949
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,640
with the people you know unfortunately

950
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,399
as an industry we've blamed people we've

951
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:10,960
said oh

952
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,600
users are stupid or users can't learn or

953
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,039
i can't teach them or anything else

954
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,120
that's on our problem that's awful we

955
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,960
need to take a step back and go look

956
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,000
how do we engage with the users

957
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,159
how do we enable them how do we make

958
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:27,760
them more effective not just training

959
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,600
them once a year that's useless

960
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,279
but how do we do something on a regular

961
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,799
basis like once a month

962
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,559
just teach them help them understand

963
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,320
help them protect their families their

964
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,240
friends their kids their grandparents

965
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,760
and everybody around them

966
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,080
that way they learn and then they become

967
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,799
our best

968
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,640
asset they become our first line of

969
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,000
defense

970
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,919
and the processes as much as we hate

971
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,080
paperwork and as much as it sucks

972
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,640
those processes the policies or the

973
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,600
controls

974
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,039
they help a lot

975
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,640
start thinking about them more

976
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,399
effectively before you start throwing

977
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,960
more technology of the problem

978
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,360
here's one for us again for those of you

979
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,840
that know me

980
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,640
i have two of these guys hanging around

981
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,240
and i love them and they're probably the

982
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,919
only thing that kept me going through

983
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:14,640
last year

984
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,000
no two ways about it this is a shout out

985
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,360
to the mental health hackers

986
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,960
we as a community need to unplug

987
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,880
sometimes we have to

988
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,919

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,600
me in front of any of this damn

1010
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,960
technology i don't touch it i don't

1011
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,000
wanna know there

1012
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,600
i leave my phone behind i hate

1013
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,119
technology on saturdays

1014
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,599
this is the one exception i have made in

1015
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:12,399
probably

1016
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:14,639
months because i believe this is so

1017
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,320
important and the guys called me up and

1018
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,760
said hey can i come hang out with you

1019
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,440
folks on saturday so normally i'd be

1020
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,800
nowhere near technology i'll be up in

1021
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,239
the mountains hanging out

1022
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:26,079
but please look after yourselves

1023
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,399
take time away reach out to people in

1024
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,879
this industry and go hey i got a problem

1025
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:32,480
i've done it often enough other people

1026
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,560
have done it that's what we're here for

1027
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,679
so some final thoughts

1028
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:41,598
this is our future

1029
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,599
our future is simple it's going to take

1030
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,040
all of us

1031
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,520
i don't care about your background i

1032
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,679
don't care about your race your color

1033
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,760
your creed your language how many limbs

1034
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,480
you have

1035
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,719
your orientation or anything i don't

1036
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,079
give a [ __ ]

1037
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,400
what i care about is here i care about

1038
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,720
your passion i care about your desire

1039
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,240
and i care about your want to help to

1040
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,000
protect other people and this should be

1041
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,760
when we employ people when we engage

1042
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,400
people

1043
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,240
and when we work with people that should

1044
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,560
be how we define people

1045
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,000
and it's going to take change we can't

1046
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,680
blame leadership we can't blame the

1047
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,040
research i'm sure as hell don't blame

1048
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,079
the hackers

1049
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,320
we all need to take responsibility for

1050
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,960
what's going on in this industry and we

1051
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,200
need and have to be the very change that

1052
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,960
we want to see

1053
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,200
and this is my loved one i love this one

1054
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,119
this is a fundamental attribution error

1055
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,599
we've got to stop blaming everybody we

1056
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,280
really have to stop blaming everybody

1057
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,000
else you know

1058
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,560
when you get breached when something

1059
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,599
happens

1060
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,320
when you fail stop trying to blame

1061
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,320
everybody else take a step back

1062
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,440
go look in the mirror what could i have

1063
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,760
done differently if a user clicked on

1064
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,680
something and they infected the system

1065
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,599
could you have educated that user more

1066
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,200
effectively could you have trained them

1067
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,720
could you have taught them to do

1068
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,599
something

1069
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,680
when leadership says no we're not buying

1070
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,760
any more tech maybe take a step back and

1071
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,560
go

1072
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,880
did i explain it effectively what could

1073
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,920
i have done

1074
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,240
differently to influence that situation

1075
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,320
because the attitude of i can't affect

1076
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,119
change

1077
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,040
is [ __ ] we can all affect change and

1078
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,839
we can all choose something on this one

1079
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,000
so last couple of slides and i'm going

1080
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,359
to shut up and we'll do q a

1081
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,440
so this is kind of a cool we've all come

1082
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,040
at this from different directions by far

1083
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,640
and away i've been in this industry way

1084
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,240
too long i've seen way too many changes

1085
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,520
and i love the industry

1086
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,040
the people that are coming into this

1087
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,720
industry now are great there are some

1088
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,960
amazing ideas some amazing thoughts

1089
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,040
you know i was introduced by an amazing

1090
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,880
individual who has done so much in this

1091
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,920
industry as well

1092
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,599
the people that are putting this on for

1093
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,440
the 10th year

1094
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,599
are amazing in this industry we've all

1095
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,920
come at it from different directions

1096
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,320
so we're all in the same boat we're all

1097
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,000
trying to affect change we're all trying

1098
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,920
to do things differently so we need to

1099
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,320
figure out how we can do that

1100
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,440
and as i said as individuals if we

1101
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,599
do this individually we're going to fail

1102
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:58,960
the only way

1103
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,520
that we work effectively is if we do

1104
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,599
this together the only way this succeeds

1105
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,040
is if we work together

1106
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,440
and that's across the globe that's

1107
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,320
everywhere and

1108
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,400
and this is remember this is a part

1109
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,240
english part scottish guy who was born

1110
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,000
in cyprus who lives in the u.s talking

1111
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,680
about a conference in chile

1112
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,240
so if anybody can reach across the globe

1113
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,320
and do this that'd be us

1114
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,880
so do me a favor let's put the country

1115
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,720
barriers down let's actually figure out

1116
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,599
how we can all work together please

1117
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,119
all right huge thanks to everybody for

past oh that's good to hear

1154
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,280
well we have some questions from the

1155
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,880
from the attendees so

1156
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,960
do you think today that the artificial

1157
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,079
intelligence

1158
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,200
is generating cyber attacks

1159
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,960
or do you know if they're working or

1160
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,880
investigating to create that kind of

1161
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,599
attacks

1162
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,280
oh yeah we've been we've been working on

1163
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,960
that for years so

1164
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,640
if you go out and do some research uh

1165
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,160
four years ago i think i was i was part

1166
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,839
of a project so i'll put my hand up on

1167
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:06,560
this one

1168
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,480
it was called the darpa grand cyber

1169
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,160
challenge or the darpa grand challenge

1170
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,280
and it was basically

1171
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,599
adversarial and defensive machine

1172
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:15,119
learning against each other so it was

1173
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,960
machine against machine

1174
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,640
and they were learning each other's

1175
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,440
tactics and it was a self-enclosed unit

1176
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,200
and we had a whole bunch of competitions

1177
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,720
from a whole bunch of people this was

1178
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,599
four or five years ago now so yeah i

1179
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,200
mean is it being designed that way

1180
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,599
absolutely is it in use at this moment

1181
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,440
in time good question

1182
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,680
we have seen advances we've obviously

1183
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,400
seen advances in the defensive system so

1184
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,520
security orchestration takes

1185
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,839
sets of attacks and tries to do tributes

1186
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,280
and stuff like that but

1187
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,520
yeah it's definitely coming along no two

1188
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,440
ways about it

1189
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,599
thank you um

1190
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,640
uh can i am i more protected from an

1191
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,480
attack if i use linux or ubuntu

1192
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,920
um you can protect i mean

1193
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,960
you can protect anything well

1194
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,480
let me rephrase that let me ask you

1195
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,000
really rephrase that you can't

1196
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,240
protect anything but you can reduce the

1197
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,280
risk so

1198
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,880
nothing is secure let's be perfectly

1199
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,520
honest i mean linux has its own problems

1200
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,440
ubuntu's got his own what linux is

1201
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,839
i mean i use macintosh system so at the

1202
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,079
end of the day that's a bsd an open bsd

1203
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,280
system which is like

1204
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,680
mother and father of all of these um

1205
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,119
this has issues

1206
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,119
windows that all the operating systems

1207
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,400
have issues

1208
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,119
it's what you do to lower the risk you

1209
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:35,520
know

1210
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,079
how active do you use the firewalls how

1211
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,760
active are you at putting some kind of

1212
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,720
protection

1213
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,800
what do you know that should be running

1214
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,319
versus what is running what do you have

1215
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:45,440
on the browser

1216
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,200
and then also what are you paying

1217
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,839
attention to are you watching your logs

1218
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:51,119
are you doing all these things

1219
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,280
everything's everything can be attacked

1220
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,440
no two ways about it it's just what do

1221
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,800
you do to lower your risk

1222
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,400
i hope that helps okay i have another

1223
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,520
question here

1224
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,560
thinking in the theory of tanners who

1225
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,599
or yeah who one or more persons could

1226
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,280
uh could leader this could take the

1227
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,800
leadership of this and

1228
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,520
and as to your experience say that one

1229
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,400
again

1230
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,440
yeah i'm sorry my i'm done that's okay

1231
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,920
so thinking in the theory of tenors of

1232
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,119
thanos

1233
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:30,240
oh yeah yeah as to your experience

1234
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,319
in other words who could lead who could

1235
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:35,839
lead our industry

1236
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:40,319
yes yeah oh there's some good people

1237
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:40,960
there's some

1238
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,280
i don't think it's one person i i think

1239
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,280
in our industry we yeah and you've i

1240
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,560
mean i've been watching

1241
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,880
i've watched some of the some of the

1242
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,480
videos that you've put out

1243
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,079
um and some of the people you've had

1244
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,680
talk there have been some amazing people

1245
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,200
that have done talks

1246
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,760
to me i think the leadership takes a lot

1247
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,480
of us it cannot be one voice

1248
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,800
it has to be numerous voices i mean

1249
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,480
you've got jack daniels you've got chris

1250
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,280
nicholson

1251
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,040
you've got amazing people there you have

1252
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,800
amazing people in the middle at least

1253
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,400
you have amazing people in europe

1254
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,480
south america i mean you think of some

1255
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,240
of the fantastic people

1256
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,920
that are in the community in south

1257
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,800
america that are leading the community

1258
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,119
i think it takes a number of us and i

1259
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:22,560
think it's going to take a number of us

1260
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,920
you know ian admit i mean there's so

1261
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,520
many good people

1262
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,359
that i think it has to take a number of

1263
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,200
us to sit down together

1264
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,040
and go how can we affect change

1265
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,680
um and if i can be at the table and hang

1266
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,880
out and help people

1267
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,480
i will definitely do it i would love to

1268
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,640
help out because i think it takes more

1269
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,240
than just a single leader i think it

1270
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,680
could down i think somebody has to kick

1271
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,599
it off which is kind of what some of us

1272
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,119
are trying to do

1273
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:48,960
but i think it's going to take numbers

1274
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,560
of us because i think ava said it right

1275
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,319
she's like you know i'm an old white guy

1276
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,839
let's be honest

1277
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:56,960
um and old white guys can

1278
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,520
not be the ones at the table you have

1279
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,040
karen elizari

1280
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,920
from israel as an amazing female leader

1281
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,760
you have so many people

1282
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,319
that are in this industry that are not

1283
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:09,920
old white males that

1284
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,079
need to be at that table that need to

1285
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:13,599
help out you look at africa i mean

1286
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,119
there's some fantastic

1287
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,280
people in the hacking community in the

1288
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,800
research community

1289
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,640
that need to be at that table so i think

1290
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,079
it will take a number of us to do this

1291
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,119
thank you

1292
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,200
which way do you think is the best to

1293
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,920
explain cyber security to the users

1294
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,000
since a lot of i.t people think that

1295
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,440
only they have to know

1296
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,680
and they don't have to democrat

1297
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,640
democratize their

1298
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,079
we have to talk to users so i talked

1299
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,760
about a little bit in the talk

1300
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,800
um i have partnered up with a training

1301
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,960
company and i don't use part time i help

1302
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,839
them out

1303
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:53,359
and they pay me and i do it on a

1304
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:55,200
part-time basis for me what i do with

1305
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,400
that training

1306
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,440
is we turn what i know up here into

1307
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,319
english

1308
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:03,520
plain simple english

1309
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,520
now that also gets translated i know

1310
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,359
gabrielle has those translated into

1311
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:08,880
other languages

1312
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,760
but we talk with people we don't talk it

1313
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,800
down to them

1314
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,640
and we don't say oh you're a user you're

1315
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,079
going to know we talk to them in plain

1316
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:17,680
simple english and i think that's what's

1317
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,640
going to help

1318
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,560
it's going to be those communications

1319
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,079
it's going to be the training companies

1320
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:23,839
that help people and it's free

1321
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:25,920
the stuff that we do is free we're not

1322
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,839
charging you you can watch

1323
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:30,319
like at least half or two-thirds of the

1324
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:31,200
videos

1325
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,800
without having to pay anything so it's

1326
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,800
out there we use it and it's available

1327
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,720
the dictionary that i've built i've

1328
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,160
built an entire dictionary we're

1329
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,440
building more of it

1330
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,440
that we've put together that translates

1331
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,680
geek speak into english it's free

1332
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,200
put it out there so the people can use

1333
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,800
it so the resource is

1334
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,720
there for people to actually learn we

1335
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,079
just have to put them in people's hands

1336
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:52,000
and the i.t people

1337
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,400
anybody who says that they don't want to

1338
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,040
educate or should not educate the users

1339
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,839
needs to be tasted everybody it this is

1340
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:01,440
everybody's problems i mean the thing is

1341
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,000
you know

1342
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,920
we're all walking around with these

1343
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,280
things

1344
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,839
um we all we're we're all sitting around

1345
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:09,040
with with flipping

1346
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,480
with iphones these are dangerous

1347
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,359
these are damn dangerous pieces of

1348
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:16,960
technology

1349
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,839
but we don't think about it that way we

1350
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:21,760
hand them to our kids

1351
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,880
and we're like oh you go use this but we

1352
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:25,440
don't

1353
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,720
think about the consequences so

1354
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,480
that to me comes to the training it

1355
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,000
comes to educating the children

1356
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
it comes to educating the parents or the

1357
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,040
guardians

1358
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,720
it comes to doing that and school

1359
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,880
education and home education it comes to

1360
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,319
educating everybody

1361
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,960
so we can do it we just have to do it

1362
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,560
and there's plenty of resources there to

1363
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,079
do it in a plain simple language

1364
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,240
thank you so much i have one last

1365
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,200
question

1366
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,480
totally educate politicians about cyber

1367
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,000
security changing their

1368
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,160
character or thinking that it's all

1369
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,839
related to technical things

1370
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:07,200
can we shoot the politicians please some

1371
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,319
of them

1372
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:11,599
especially in this country

1373
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,200
i don't know that's a tough one i so

1374
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,880
that is a hard one because i don't

1375
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,680
my tolerance for politics is low there's

1376
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,640
an amazing so

1377
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,839
for those of you that know the industry

1378
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:28,400
um josh

1379
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,640
and there's a bunch of really good guys

1380
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,400
called i am the cavalry

1381
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,640
um do a little bit of research on josh

1382
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,079
coleman and there's a bunch of other

1383
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:38,640
guys inside i am the cavalry

1384
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:43,200
they have more patience than most saints

1385
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,720
because they will deal with the politics

1386
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,720
i mean they are amazing they've gone in

1387
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,000
on healthcare they've gone in on

1388
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,520
transportation

1389
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,200
they are trying to educate the

1390
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,560
politicians

1391
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,280
um i think more of us could step up i

1392
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,400
mean perfect example

1393
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,240
the us is going through elections at the

1394
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,920
moment i've done

1395
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,000
a bunch of talks on election security

1396
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,079
and the lack of it

1397
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,480
but if you look at defcon defcon had the

1398
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,560
voting village for a number of years

1399
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,119
they put an

1400
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,319
amazing like an amazing report out about

1401
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:15,200
the 29

1402
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,839
votes 2019 voting village something like

1403
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:20,160
that report needs to be printed off by

1404
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,040
everybody

1405
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,319
and handed to their politician to go

1406
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:27,359
are you really telling me this is how we

1407
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:28,960
deal with democracy

1408
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,599
and helping to educate people as to what

1409
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,119
their report actually means

1410
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,720
so i think we can all play a part in it

1411
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,240
we can look at the resources again the

1412
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,599
voting village stuff is a perfect

1413
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:38,640
example

1414
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,400
we can look at ransomware we can look at

1415
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,920
healthcare we look at the military i

1416
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:42,960
mean i do a lot of stuff for the

1417
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,480
military and the government

1418
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,000
and we're educating people but it

1419
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,200
is a huge uphill battle

1420
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,440
like a huge uphill battle no two ways

1421
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,480
about it

1422
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,400
and it's there's no easy solution i

1423
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,920
think it just takes more and more and

1424
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,119
more of us

1425
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:02,800
talking about it in non-technical ways

1426
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,160
it's talking about it in english

1427
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,839
so i think that's going to help a ton

1428
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,520
