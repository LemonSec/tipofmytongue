12
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,919
hi everyone and welcome to ochopunto

13
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,759
ocho my name is nina ali

14
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,120
and today we're going to be talking

15
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,800
about defending the impossible

16
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,720
a little bit about myself my name is

17
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,800
nina ali i am the executive director of

18
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,039
the biohacking village at defcon

19
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,120
i have worked in biomedical technology

20
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,880
and security in new york city for the

21
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,600
past 15 years

22
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,520
i've done a couple of other things in my

23
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,600
life i've worked for the department of

24
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,400
defense

25
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,440
i was in the marine corps um

26
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,280
so with all of that said i just want to

27
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,639
ask a couple of questions in the

28
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,800
audience to make sure that we are all

29
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,280
thinking about different things while we

30
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,720
have this talk

31
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,840
so are you a programmer are you

32
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,960
an engineer are you a clinician are you

33
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,759
a physician

34
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,800
perhaps you're a policy maker or

35
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,400
are you a patient i have this

36
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,919
tendency to think that we are all

37
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,840
patients because we all at some point go

38
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,039
to the doctor

39
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,280
so therefore we are all inherently

40
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,800
invested and involved

41
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,000
in making sure that healthcare works

42
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,400
a couple of definitions we are all

43
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,039
familiar

44
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,280
with security researchers also known as

45
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,160
hackers and

46
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,720
we take our computer expertise to work

47
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,440
on technological problems

48
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,199
and there are also biohacking biohackers

49
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,880
there are also english and there are

50
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,360
also

51
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,759
biohackers also known as citizen

52
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,120
scientists

53
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,160
we are the folks that do the diy

54
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,080
bio and we find different solutions for

55
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,599
problems that we find and we may not

56
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:06,880
have the resources

57
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,599
such as money or time to work on these

58
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:10,080
but we

59
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,560
we focus and we learn about what we're

60
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,440
doing and

61
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,360
try to create change

62
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,199
just like the human body there are very

63
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,280
different systems

64
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,720
in computers so when you think about

65
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,720
how the computer is set up and the

66
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,160
different applications that you're going

67
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,199
through in the different parts of the

68
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,000
hardware

69
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,800
it's it's very parallel to how the body

70
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,280
works

71
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,560
every system has its own different kind

72
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,280
of muscles

73
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,560
different kind of molecular setup so

74
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,759
everything interacts and each part makes

75
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,879
the next part better

76
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,199
so we are in the middle of covid and i

77
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,639
just want to highlight

78
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,680
some of the things that the

79
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,759
hacker community and the biohacking

80
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,280
community have helped

81
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,840
with to benefit society and move it

82
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,840
forward through these hard times

83
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,039
so there's been a a

84
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,199
larger substantial push for medtech

85
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,639
for all of these folks to be more

86
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,479
involved do it again

87
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,039
so i just wanted to point out some of

88
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:17,840
the help

89
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,680
that the hacker community and the

90
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,199
citizen scientists

91
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,680
have helped with industry so that we can

92
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,840
all get through this together

93
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,240
and a couple of things to remember as we

94
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,279
keep going on

95
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,240
there has been exponential growth in the

96
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,519
healthcare system

97
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,719
especially now because we are doing more

98
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,360
of the digital medicine and there is a

99
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,200
human at the beginning and end of all of

100
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,440
these workflows

101
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,240
technology is not industry specific we

102
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,480
can all go on overstock.com

103
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,839
and pull a line of code out and put that

104
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:56,320
into

105
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,800
any of the devices the software the

106
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,240
programming that we're working on

107
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,320
and move forward from there and also

108
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,080
i i tend to think that people think

109
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,760
healthcare is just about the patient and

110
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,279
the physician but there's so much more

111
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,720
to that

112
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,640
in the facility itself you also have to

113
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,720
concern yourself with water electricity

114
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,560
the internet infrastructure finance and

115
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,480
transportation because that does also

116
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:20,880
play

117
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,839
into it

118
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,600
so my other title for this talk is

119
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,200
never going to give you up the data and

120
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
never going to let you down the patient

121
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,519
so

122
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,120
you have been officially rick rolled

123
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,399
so how did the healthcare industry react

124
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:38,880
to

125
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,360
covet

126
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,040
a little background on how and why

127
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,880
healthcare is so interesting for a lot

128
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,200
of people

129
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,800
it's very attractive because there's

130
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,720
more victims in one place

131
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,320
unfortunately there's a lot of data in

132
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:05,839
one um

133
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,000
so why are hospitals so interesting and

134
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,240
attractive for criminals

135
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,560
there's a lot of information in one

136
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,720
place

137
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,839
i'm gonna change

138
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,880
so why are hospitals so interesting and

139
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,560
attractive for criminals there's more

140
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,320
information in one place

141
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,720
think about all that data that's flowing

142
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,480
through all those different mechanisms

143
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,079
different applications and they all end

144
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:44,720
up

145
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,880
in one emr for example or one

146
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,920
pacemaker so who wants this

147
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,079
medical data everyone wants this data

148
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,440
the physicians want the data the

149
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,200
patients want the data

150
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,480
banks life insurance there's

151
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,480
a lot of people that are consumed with

152
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,480
knowing what

153
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,959
what is going on with the patient and

154
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:07,760
what can

155
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,200
they do with this data there are a lot

156
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,000
of options um

157
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,720
as we all know unfortunately you can

158
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,160
hurt a patient through some of these

159
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,720
things

160
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,519
but simultaneously and more so you can

161
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,320
help patients

162
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,240
move forward with their life in a better

163
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,160
way

164
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,000
so what does the system look like to a

165
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,399
hacker there's so much there

166
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,360
for people to take advantage of think

167
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,480
about your bank

168
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,279
or your credit card for example if you

169
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,720
lost your credit card

170
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,320
the most information that they will have

171
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,839
on you is your name

172
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,120
and the number on the credit card

173
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,519
and maybe a couple of other things about

174
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,200
you however

175
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,320
if you lose your emr

176
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,200
information your medical information

177
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,760
they have

178
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,959
all of this your first middle name your

179
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,399
address your date of birth your social

180
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,720
security number or your national number

181
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,040
a lot of information is taken in when

182
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,839
you

183
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,040
are a patient so a lot of what we have

184
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,600
to do

185
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,560
as biohacker folks as as security

186
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,680
researchers

187
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,519
is to make sure that all of this data

188
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,600
maintains its integrity and stays within

189
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,880
the confines

190
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,560
of the medical care system

191
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,320
also what we have learned through covid

192
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,120
and how its

193
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,680
its effects on people have been is that

194
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,360
there's a lot of inequity

195
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,720
so as we continue to move forward

196
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,120
with what we are working on we are

197
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,639
looking for

198
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,240
more equity in health care in financial

199
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,880
issues in food deserts in prevention of

200
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,040
food deserts and better education

201
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,480
because again there is a patient at the

202
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,800
beginning and endis workflow and making

203
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,480
sure that they understand their care

204
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,160
and they understand it at a level that

205
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,880
they can speak about it

206
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,800
makes them better patients and helps

207
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,240
them understand how their future is

208
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,160
affected by it

209
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,480
gender issues making sure that women

210
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,680
and people of color are heard

211
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,040
and their situations are taken seriously

212
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,760
um disability they're that seems to be

213
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,120
very overlooked and just

214
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,200
ensuring that those folks are heard and

215
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,040
seen and their care is taken into

216
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,800
consideration as well

217
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,680
and also cultural issues um

218
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,959
statistically

219
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,320
they're in the united states there are

220
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,200
five percent of physicians are

221
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,399
african-american black

222
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,000
so there's a large chasm there's a large

223
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,680
disparity

224
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,480
of how you can communicate with your

225
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,120
physician

226
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,800
because they may or may not understand

227
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,880
you from a cultural

228
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,959
standpoint and that does have an effect

229
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,720
on care and how you are being taken care

230
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,360
of

231
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,639
as well as infrastructure because we are

232
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,839
moving more toward

233
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,440
medical being digitalized ensuring that

234
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,959
you have

235
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,560
adequate internet so that you can

236
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,000
connect to your physician

237
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,320
is a very big deal and that's happened

238
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,760
in quite a lot of countries

239
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,000
so how are we moving on with

240
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,760
kovid being currently taking place

241
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,160
we are moving again more toward digital

242
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,839
medicine and telehealth

243
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,839
so it was a blossoming field right

244
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,000
before kovid and as soon as kobe hit and

245
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,680
we couldn't necessarily go to our

246
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,720
physicians

247
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,199
it became a major big deal so that

248
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,000
people could

249
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,199
still continue their care and that they

250
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:39,680
could

251
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,040
be taken care of so

252
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,920
this leads to a continuous monitoring of

253
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,199
patient status

254
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,199
which i think is much better because

255
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,680
under normal circumstances we go for an

256
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,440
annual visit annual being one data point

257
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,000
um so this way once you have continuous

258
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,920
monitoring of patient care

259
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,760
you can have different data points that

260
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,440
you can instruct the patient better

261
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,199
because you have more knowledge

262
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,639
about how they actually are ease of use

263
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:09,680
for patients

264
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,079
something i continue to talk through

265
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,839
with people

266
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,279
is we are building technology for four

267
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,000
different generations building for

268
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,399
baby boomeration who did not grow up

269
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,079
with computers

270
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:28,320
we are building for gen x

271
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,959
who were brought up with computers

272
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,399
however there was no security

273
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,600
we are also building for gen z who

274
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,880
got computers with security and we are

275
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,000
also building for

276
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,880
the millennials so we have to build

277
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,920
those things

278
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,720
the the applications with all of these

279
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,639
generations in mind because we are still

280
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,399
all in the workforce and we are still

281
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,720
all very much patients

282
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,360
digital medicine has also democratized

283
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,240
care

284
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,920
people can see their physicians now

285
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,519
without having to take

286
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,560
days off without having to go for the

287
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,079
very long

288
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,399
transportation visits to go see them

289
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,440
it's again

290
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,680
when you are building your applications

291
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,720
when you are building

292
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,199
resources for folks these are things to

293
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,320
think about

294
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,160
also there's a link please read that i

295
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,839
think it's it's very good

296
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,279
with clinical trials traditionally they

297
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,279
have not been very diverse

298
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,440
and in america i believe

299
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,199
it's 70 percent of

300
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,800
clinical trials have been based on

301
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,480
cis white men and that medication

302
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,199
is also then given to women and people

303
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,480
of color

304
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,320
and trans folks and things like and

305
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,480
that creates that's yet again that's

306
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,480
another chasm

307
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,759
but with digital medicine

308
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,240
being more involved now we have the

309
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,120
opportunity

310
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,959
to enhance these these trials

311
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,079
by caring for people at home and asking

312
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,679
them various different questions because

313
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,439
technology has given us

314
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,919
less barriers and ways to reach people

315
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,319
in their homes on their daily lives

316
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,679
and getting that data into the trial

317
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,679
and better realization in longitudinal

318
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:26,160
data

319
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,480
and real-time insight with larger

320
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,840
cohorts of study

321
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,000
threat modeling has become amazing

322
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,799
recently

323
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,960
the the trick bot

324
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,160
came out in the youth system

325
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,080
in america and while it is a black swan

326
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,960
event

327
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,160
we have to take into consideration

328
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,480
how are we mapping or not mapping the

329
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,480
systems that we currently have

330
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,000
so are we do do we have

331
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,919
anything mapped out and if not how can

332
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,760
we get started

333
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,480
because we need to know where our assets

334
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,200
are

335
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:15,840
and because it's a 365 day

336
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,039
and because it's a 365 366 with a leap

337
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:21,919
year

338
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,600
um 24 hour seven day awake

339
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,840
model that we're working with this

340
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,840
industry is constantly moving and so

341
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,440
are the items inside this hospital so we

342
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,240
have to know

343
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,799
where things are so that we can mitigate

344
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:37,679
risk

345
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,840
and properly protect what we're working

346
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,280
on so a couple

347
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,320
of links that are set here

348
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,080
um stride which is by adam shostak

349
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,360
um the fda has started to mandate that

350
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,840
medical device manufacturers start

351
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,799
building out

352
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,919
their threat models and when they

353
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,520
provide these to

354
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,960
the hospitals i gotta start that again

355
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,960
the fda has started to mandate that

356
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,360
medical device manufacturers

357
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,000
start providing threat models of their

358
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,360
devices and giving them

359
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,240
over the hospital they can start

360
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,080
implementing that change

361
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,320
in the hospital itself which is great um

362
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,960
the other part of this is includes no

363
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,360
dirt has taken into context

364
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,960
medical devices and the medical

365
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,480
infrastructure in the medical industry

366
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,120
itself

367
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,360
and has started to provide more insight

368
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,039
and a more

369
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,400
inclined inclusive specific way

370
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,880
of threat modeling so that's something

371
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,320
else to start thinking about

372
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,480
as you create applications as you create

373
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,799
devices and as we start to reimagine

374
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,799
and reinvent how healthcare will be

375
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,600
moving forward

376
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,440
so i talked a little bit about this

377
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,679
before microsoft xp

378
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,880
and microsoft windows 95

379
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,280
a lot of devices that are currently

380
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,320
being built

381
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,640
are built on linux platforms and we are

382
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,520
still using

383
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,720
microsoft xp and windows 95 as the

384
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,960
operating system platforms

385
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,240
um the major issues

386
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,320
of these platforms as the operating

387
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,520
systems

388
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,960
is that they've kind of been put to bed

389
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,520
already

390
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,919
they are their end of life they are no

391
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:30,720
longer

392
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,159
supported however it's for the industry

393
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,600
to from it because

394
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,000
of the applications that they're built

395
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,640
um

396
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,440
that the devices are built for work

397
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,960
specifically with these

398
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,799
so there is a movement to apps

399
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,360
move all the medical devices and the

400
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,520
electronic medical records to the cloud

401
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,440
that is still being

402
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,159
worked on because there's a lot of

403
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,280
detail that goes

404
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,480
into this situation recent issues that

405
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,799
came up with microsoft is that microsoft

406
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:03,440
xp

407
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,440
the source code was released and that

408
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,039
creates a lot of problems just in

409
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:07,600
general

410
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,000
for a lot of days that still work from

411
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,960
xp

412
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,640
and also trickbot was recently found

413
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,400
in the uhs system over here as i said

414
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,000
before

415
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,280
and um about that

416
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,760
microsoft took back command and control

417
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,799
of their

418
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,960
their code so that they could disable

419
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,320
the ips

420
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,360
and work on this to

421
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,240
better to better be a resource for the

422
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,280
industries that are

423
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,919
that might be under attack from this um

424
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,679
this is still a story that's in progress

425
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:40,159
so

426
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,480
we will have to keep up um catch up with

427
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,840
it and see what happens

428
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,159
a little bit about readiness and

429
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,760
resilience

430
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,120
i tend to think that there are not

431
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,960
too many information security teams

432
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,159
in hospitals um so a couple of

433
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,520
suggestions

434
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,919
around all of this is perhaps we create

435
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,000
virtual and volunteer csos

436
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,200
to help with healthcare and

437
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,360
a lot of around how i think about this

438
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,039
is that they don't necessarily

439
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,760
have to be from the healthcare industry

440
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,440
it may actually be better that they come

441
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,720
from other industries

442
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,559
so that they can lend their insight and

443
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,480
foresight into how

444
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,799
healthcare is running or should run and

445
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,840
maybe that'll create a better situation

446
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,360
um kovid has showed us that

447
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,480
we do need more education around

448
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,960
science i think my favorite science

449
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,559
quote when you ask someone

450
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,600
about biology of the cell which is

451
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,440
absolutely correct but there's so much

452
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,360
more and so much more beauty

453
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,559
to biology and i understand that

454
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,480
sometimes it's a hard concept to take in

455
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,320
but it's also a part of your health care

456
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,159
which means maybe um we need to

457
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,360
ingrain that a little more especially

458
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,159
due to the current circumstances and

459
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,520
also with kovid

460
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,159
there's a lack of trust in scientific

461
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,080
knowledge right now

462
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,480
so i better educate how covet worked

463
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,000
um sorry how coveted works on your lungs

464
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,600
and in your body

465
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,440
would promote better resilience for how

466
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,720
people are reacting to it

467
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,480
using different softwares to test

468
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,400
emulated ransom attacks in a production

469
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,640
environment which is mirrored not that

470
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,880
we're going into production to do this

471
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,679
but it would show folks where things are

472
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,279
how they're attacked

473
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,480
um better ways to to create

474
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,640
barriers around it um there is defense

475
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,000
in depth yes

476
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,840
but we also need to know where to put

477
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,720
those defense measures

478
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,880
full cyber range for testing which plays

479
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,919
into that

480
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,200
um zero trust is starting to become a

481
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,360
very big deal

482
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,360
and micro segmentation so if you're not

483
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,279
fair with zero trust

484
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:09,120
the security industry is very familiar

485
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:09,679
with

486
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,039
trust but verify where zero trust

487
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,880
is never trust always verify

488
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,880
so you will always as you walk through

489
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,320
your systems at work

490
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,440
you will continuously have to prove who

491
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,000
you are

492
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,760
and it's an escalation of privilege and

493
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,400
whether you have that that

494
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,840
ability to get into things or not and

495
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,400
also

496
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,320
shameless plug for the biohacking

497
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,600
village we

498
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,440
have a pseudo hospital set up where

499
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,039
manufacturers come in and they have

500
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,799
face-to-face talks with the different

501
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,080
hacker folks

502
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,039
and there are communications around any

503
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,200
vulnerabilities any issues

504
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,880
and it's an open dialogue and that's

505
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,559
what we're trying to create because for

506
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,840
so long

507
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,120
the healthcare industry has been afraid

508
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,400
to have conversation

509
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,600
with us as hackers and opening

510
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,640
those barriers and those doors gives

511
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,840
us as hackers credentials into what

512
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,440
we're doing to make things better

513
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,679
as well as providing the medical device

514
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,360
manufacturers credence to know that

515
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,000
their work

516
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,080
is valid and they've done a great job

517
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,440
and if there's something that needs to

518
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,080
be fixed

519
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,600
they have us on the other end that they

520
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,520
can call and we can communicate and work

521
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,559
through those things together

522
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,440
and a couple of takeaways just some

523
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,400
things that

524
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,720
i may or may not have mentioned but this

525
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,799
if you if you heard nothing else that i

526
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:33,120
had

527
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,200
a conversation about this would be the

528
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,039
one slide that you can take a picture of

529
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,080
and move forward with

530
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,600
um in in your places of work

531
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,279
software is a medical device this is

532
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,880
where digital medicine comes in

533
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,600
and the fda has a lot of different

534
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,440
guidances on this i would suggest

535
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,400
going to their website to learn more

536
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,440
again i talked about zero trust

537
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,559
never trust always very

538
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,640
bug bounce and coordinate closure again

539
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,559
this at the the biohacking village but

540
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:03,919
one of the

541
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,760
ensure that the the company that you

542
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,320
work on has a body and a coordinated

543
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,400
disclosure program so that

544
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,440
we as hackers or just whoever can put

545
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,080
something

546
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,159
into your company to say this is what we

547
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,000
found

548
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
we would love to help you with it please

549
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,360
talk to us

550
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,559
um about the

551
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,200
medical industry remembering that it's a

552
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,159
24 hour

553
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,200
7 day a week 365 day

554
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,080
industry we can have table tops and have

555
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,760
discussions around things that may or

556
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,120
may not go on

557
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,600
but we also have to feel the impact of

558
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,919
these things so creating a cyber range

559
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,760
where these things have a real-time

560
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,880
impact on the humans that are involved

561
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,279
and and gives you that reaction time and

562
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,840
gives you the feel

563
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,400
is really handy um

564
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,919
workflows and threat models

565
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,600
understanding that there's a patient at

566
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,039
the beginning and ends of this and also

567
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,640
a physician at the beginning and end of

568
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,240
this

569
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,360
very important for how things work again

570
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,200
generationally as well

571
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,760
um and also understanding that the

572
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,200
applications that we are building how

573
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,559
they work into the current medical

574
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,159
system

575
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,600
higher researchers hire people that want

576
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,279
to help you make your devices

577
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:27,440
better post-incident legislature

578
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,840
there are currently none so what i mean

579
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,559
by this

580
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,799
are if a patient so some things that we

581
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:35,360
work on

582
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,880
at different conferences whether it be

583
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,720
at the biohacking village or

584
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,480
at cyber med summit which is remember

585
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,679
christian the method of tele

586
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,559
a lot of things are not made aware of

587
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,200
the technology behind

588
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,279
what's in the medical devices such as an

589
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,279
insulin pump or a pacemaker

590
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,960
and with that said when they're working

591
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,880
on a patient they

592
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,159
may think that something happened with

593
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,919
the patient rather than something happen

594
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:00,559
with

595
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,200
the technology that they're using and

596
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,000
instead

597
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,520
of taking the the device that may have

598
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,640
interrupted

599
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,000
care for the patient they they

600
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,919
they may just re-image it rather than

601
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,279
going back and scoping out

602
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,960
the issue and saying what happened with

603
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,399
this in particular and it may not have

604
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,000
been anything

605
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,080
but just to ensure that they've covered

606
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,120
everything we

607
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,760
currents they do not have legislature or

608
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,600
any mandates that dictate

609
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,080
folks to do that but future state it may

610
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,240
be something to do

611
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,039
other than that global initiatives that

612
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:35,600
may be

613
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,559
important patient pertinence again

614
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,399
protection of patient data

615
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,600
so important it scopes out into so many

616
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,000
different

617
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,600
industries and how it can hurt a patient

618
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,520
um worldwide there are different

619
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,039
initiatives that

620
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,679
countries are taking so china has one

621
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:54,640
belt one road

622
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,200
china 2020 where they are pulling out

623
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,080
data to

624
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,279
ensure patient safety privacy data

625
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,320
calling

626
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,159
and also how to better the health

627
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,720
of that community as well as saudi

628
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,760
arabia

629
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,080
and the u.n the united nation has

630
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,840
sustainable goals where they're trying

631
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,240
to

632
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,760
either um bring up the percentage

633
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,360
of people going to their health care

634
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,279
provider and getting care

635
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:24,720
or perhaps lowering hiv status

636
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,000
in the world literacy as i had

637
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,600
conversation about before

638
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,679
just making sure that you as a patient

639
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,200
as a physician as an engineer as a

640
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,559
policy person

641
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,559
understand the breadth and depth of the

642
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:37,679
medical

643
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,840
um of the medical

644
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,720
ecosystem just making sure

645
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,559
with literacy just making sure that you

646
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,559
as a patient as a physician as an

647
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,720
engineer as a policy maker understand

648
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,600
the ecosystem in the biomedical area so

649
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,720
that you can

650
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,080
help make better better laws

651
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,360
better regulations for patients and for

652
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,080
yourselves working in this industry and

653
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,799
lastly

654
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:09,279
the hippocratic oath a lot of people

655
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,159
understand that

656
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,600
it's the do no harm which is brilliant

657
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,240
and

658
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,480
and that's for the physician that is the

659
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,919
physician oath that they take when they

660
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:18,559
become

661
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,679
doctors um there's a paper

662
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:26,480
by i am the cavalry that also says

663
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,520
do no harm and it's a it's an oath taken

664
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,919
by the medical device manufacturers

665
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,399
also brilliant um at the end of that

666
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,080
paper i also stipulate that the

667
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,840
healthcare delivery organizations

668
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,000
that the hospitals should also take this

669
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,880
oh

670
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,279
a lot of the reason is because i as a

671
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,039
patient i may not physically

672
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,480
be there however my data my binary

673
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,600
my information and my perhaps genomes as

674
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,320
well

675
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,240
are in that hospital system and i think

676
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,679
they should also take that

677
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,159
hippocratic of do no harm with my data

678
00:30:58,159 --> 00:30:59,919
with my genome with my binary

679
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:01,760
information

680
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,000
so thank you so much for coming to this

681
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,880
talk

682
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,360
um i am available if you want to have a

683
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,279
conversation with me at nina

684
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,320
at villagebeat.io and i am also

685
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,360
on uh twitter

686

i appreciate you all thank you

695
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,720
hi hiya nice to see you

696
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,919
again so i wanted

697
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,480
the world to understand your awesomeness

698
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,279
and greatness

699
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,559
and i also didn't want them to go

700
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,360
through another powerpoint because i'm

701
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,799
sure everyone is exhausted so i wanted

702
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:53,760
to make this a little more

703
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,960
conversational

704
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,360
and more than that i talked about

705
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,840
medical devices

706
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,080
and the issues surround that but i also

707
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,679
wanted to give a taste of

708
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,440
what the rest of the biohacking world

709
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,000
has in store for folks

710
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,200
and you're one of my dearest

711
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,240
nearest friends and i wanted to showcase

712
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,519
you

713
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,600
so introduction this is michael

714
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,120
he is the spokesperson for fort thies

715
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,080
vinegar collection

716
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,200
and the the the mastermind behind a lot

717
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,000
of

718
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,799
beautiful innovative projects and

719
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,720
hardware and software so if you want to

720
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,679
talk a little bit about that

721
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,240
um i originally come from a human rights

722
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,279
background

723
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,720
and that manifested in looking at global

724
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,200
health

725
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,880
mostly and so the fourth east vinegar

726
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,519
collective

727
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,720
became a group

728
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,360
that was dedicated to bringing medicines

729
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,279
and medical technologies to people who

730
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,960
had them but didn't need them

731
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,000
or i should say who who need them but

732
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,840
don't have them

733
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,960
um and without respect to

734
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,240
how that gets done so we do a lot of

735
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,600
things that are

736
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,640
circumlegal or uh

737
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,960
you know intra-legal um at best

738
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,200
and so that includes trying to

739
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,440
hijack existing medical devices making

740
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,320
clones

741
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,159
of existing medical devices

742
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,159
manufacturing medications

743
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,240
and finding ways that people can do this

744
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,080
themselves without need for

745
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,000
infrastructure or support from

746
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,679
institutions

747
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,039
so before this vinegar collection

748
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,880
breakout moment was the epi pencil

749
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,240
yeah that was when we started getting a

750
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,000
lot of light on us yeah

751
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,080
so can you talk about the history of the

752
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,480
epipen and how the

753
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,480
heavy pencils started coming about and

754
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,519
then

755
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,279
the manifestations of the epi pencil

756
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,440
yeah it's it's it's all really quite

757
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,279
silly in fact because

758
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:08,159
the administration of adrenaline to

759
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,239
suppress uh attacks of anaphylaxis

760
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:16,079
or asthma or any number of other things

761
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,000
is very very old i mean this is

762
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,760
you know technology that's been around

763
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,239
for decades and decades and decades

764
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,359
and it's a fairly simple thing you

765
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,320
really take some adrenaline and you give

766
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,239
it to somebody by an intramuscular

767
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,280
injection it's

768
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,839
really hard to get wrong but because of

769
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:40,000
the cultural shift that happened to

770
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,199
offload responsibility

771
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:47,040
and the lawsuit

772
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,719
structure of the legal system that built

773
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:54,159
in the united states especially

774
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,359
the idea of liability became

775
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:00,640
something that was so

776
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,280
important to take into account that

777
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,880
something as simple as giving somebody

778
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,119
an intramuscular injection

779
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,040
became something that people were scared

780
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,960
to do even if it would save somebody's

781
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,240
life because they

782
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,720
were like what if i get it wrong what if

783
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,079
i hurt somebody what if i cause an

784
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:17,680
infection and then this person sues me

785
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,680
for a million dollars it's better to

786
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,480
just let them

787
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,119
die because then it's not my fault for

788
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:23,520
making an

789
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,359
active decision to intervene and

790
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,400
the logical but

791
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,839
rather unfortunate next step that

792
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,400
occurred was that somebody said well

793
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,720
let's automate the process and again

794
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,079
this is a natural thing that you see a

795
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,839
lot in

796
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,920
in in medicine in terms of like good

797
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,040
samaritan

798
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,680
laws and participation where what you do

799
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,359
is you say okay if you automate this

800
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,200
process then liability sits on the

801
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,560
manufacturer of the device this is

802
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,760
something with which you're

803
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,200
more familiar than maybe anybody and

804
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,320
and you see this phenomenon where

805
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,480
the automation isn't necessary the

806
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,000
automation is a function

807
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,760
of like social problem and legal problem

808
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,839
right and so the epi

809
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:15,280
was designed i guess i mean this was

810
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,000
also

811
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,680
several decades ago i think i think it

812
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,160
was first done

813
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,359
i don't know it was quite some time ago

814
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:22,560
so it's a very long established

815
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,520
technology

816
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,960
the difference is is that because of

817
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,079
again the sclerotic backward nature of

818
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,359
the us legal system

819
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,400
that got built into intellectual

820
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,040
property

821
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,320
and so the auto injector that they built

822
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,480
that particular one is covered under

823
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,320
intellectual property law and can't be

824
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,480
replicated by generic manufacturers

825
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,320
it got approved because they had the

826
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,079
money to push it through and my land did

827
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:50,400
a

828
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,839
good job of doing that and then they

829
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:55,359
proliferated and it was fine for a long

830
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:56,480
time because

831
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,200
everybody who you know not everybody but

832
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,200
most people could afford them

833
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,119
and it wasn't terribly unreasonable the

834
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,560
price they were selling them for

835
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,560
and then milan's pharmaceuticals kind of

836
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,400
took the lead the same way

837
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,839
turing pharmaceuticals did and said well

838
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,359
there's no law saying i can't be

839
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,200
predatory with my pricing practices so

840
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,680
let's jack up the price

841
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,440
and that's when it went up to

842
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,640
dollars for a set

843
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,079
and again they also they don't last

844
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,680
indefinitely despite the fact that

845
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,880
there's a preservative and there's a

846
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,720
preservative for the preservative they

847
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,800
only last 18 months you need to

848
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,560
replace them i want to back up for a

849
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,560
second in case because

850
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,320
i'm a visual learner like i understand

851
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,680
what you're talking about

852
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,400
so anaphylactic shock is what happens

853
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:42,880
when you're

854
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,960
when when you have an allergic reaction

855
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,920
to something

856
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,000
and your throat starts to close and your

857
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,920
breathing gets harder you may end up

858
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,440
with the rash hives

859
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,520
and there's this i think it's yellow if

860
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,200
i'm not mistaken there's a

861
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,920
pen that you you carry around with you

862
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,280
for such instances

863
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,079
for such events and you take the cap off

864
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:02,480
of it

865
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,520
and you shove it into your thigh or

866
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,119
any muscular area and you push down

867
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,079
and it really no no you just shove it in

868
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:12,640
is it

869
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,800
okay yeah so this is a really good thing

870
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,160
to know for anybody out there whoever

871
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,320
does come across an epipen

872
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,400
grab it like this don't put your thumb

873
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,960
on the back just grab it like this

874
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,760
there are a lot of people believe it or

875
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,160
not

876
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,599
who have [ __ ] it up by doing this

877
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:28,720
because this is a natural stabbing

878
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,160
action right you stabilize

879
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,480
don't do that grab it like this because

880
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,440
people grab it

881
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,920
backwards and then they stab themselves

882
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,520
in the thumb

883
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,200
right it's all about training but again

884
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,720
i love that because it's that diff

885
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,760
uh differentiation because i'm used to

886
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,640
giving people

887
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,520
um insulin an actual injection right

888
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,000
yeah

889
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,160
right so differentiation diabetes guns

890
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,599
push also right other pet epipen

891
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,400
slam in um right and this is the other

892
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,680
thing that's interesting about the

893
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,640
epipen

894
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,359
is that there's no safety right you once

895
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:03,680
you've

896
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,680
uncapped it when you as soon as you

897
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,960
press it in it will go

898
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,160
snap and the whole thing goes so there's

899
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,680
no safety so like

900
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,280
you have to keep it capped or it can

901
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,400
just stab you in the leg by accident

902
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,320
so how did the

903
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,320
fourth vinegar collective look at this

904
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,520
problem and say

905
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,200
we can do that we can do that better we

906
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,119
can go around this

907
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,160
yeah so the weirdest part of all of it

908
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,240
was like we saw it all going down but

909
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,480
we weren't working with medical devices

910
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,359
at the time we were

911
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:36,640
purely working with sort of the

912
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,640
pharmaceutical side and people

913
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,320
kept getting in touch through the web

914
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,920
form and saying why aren't you doing

915
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,359
something about the epipen

916
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,280
okay well it's not what we do like it is

917
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,560
a good problem but like

918
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,640
it's and like it kept coming in people

919
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,839
were like you really should do this you

920
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,440
really should do this and so

921
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,680
we stopped and and and had a meeting and

922
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,640
we were like hey

923
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,079
everybody says we should do this should

924
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,240
we do this and everybody said yeah let's

925
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,359
do this so

926
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,599
i said okay how difficult of a problem

927
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,040
could this be and the interesting thing

928
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,440
was this is kind of opaque at first like

929
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,920
why is this thing so expensive what is

930
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,839
it that needed to be done

931
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,359
and first we're looking at how to

932
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,359
manufacture uh adrenaline

933
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,400
um epinephrine and

934
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,560
this is kind of silly this is it costs a

935
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,880
dollar you can just buy it in a vial in

936
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,480
any place where there's a pharmacy in

937
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,319
the world what's the deal

938
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:29,839
and then realizing is just the mechanics

939
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,560
of the auto injector okay well this is

940
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,839
ridiculous there's got to be another

941
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,359
auto injector out there and we can just

942
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:36,880
hijack it

943
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,200
um there aren't many auto injectors

944
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,359
there's there's a glucogen pen there's

945
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:42,800
an insulin pen

946
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,560
there are a couple that are used by the

947
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,160
israeli government for like

948
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,440
anti uh like chemical weapons

949
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,640
uh things that that can be administered

950
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,400
in the field

951
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,760
um but there's this reloadable auto

952
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,640
injector for

953
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,680
needle phobic diabetics and then

954
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,240
it was just a matter of and this took a

955
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,200
few weeks so

956
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,839
i mean it was just a matter of figuring

957
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:08,880
out how to

958
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,400
mate parts that would fit getting a big

959
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:12,880
needle

960
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,960
onto a small syringe that would fit

961
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,200
inside the injector

962
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,040
and then providing some documentation

963
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,560
which is of course like the most

964
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,760
important thing

965
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,160
so a perfect segue so

966
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,440
i think when people

967
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,160
look at biohacking the first thing that

968
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,040
they think about

969
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,800
because it's easily accessible right

970
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,319
those rfid chips

971
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,720
the nfc chips because it's it's it's a

972
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,800
lot of things it's instant gratification

973
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,400
you literally have technology

974
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,119
in your hands whether it's the magnets

975
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,319
or

976
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:50,319
the chip but there's so much more to

977
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,000
biohacking

978
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,680
and just to push on the nfc

979
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,480
rfid a little bit further pacemakers

980
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,560
also have those tags inside

981
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,319
so that they can be identified and i

982
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:03,760
think a lot of people don't

983
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,040
don't recognize that um so

984
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,960
just i i would love to have that

985
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,880
conversation with you about

986
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,680
what's biohacking to you because you you

987
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,560
we both

988
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,599
have very different definitions of it i

989
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:18,560
think everybody has a different

990
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,359
definition

991
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,599
and of the various definitions that are

992
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:22,480
out there

993
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,200
my favorite or one of my favorites at

994
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:25,839
least

995
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:29,359
is the one that left anonym gives and

996
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:33,040
left says the usage of technology for

997
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,720
the improvement of quality of life

998
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,160
and i think that that is a really good

999
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,440
blanket statement because it really

1000
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,040
shows how much

1001
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,280
it really encompasses when we think

1002
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,640
about

1003
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:54,720
technology and biology and the way they

1004
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,319
interact why do we deal with technology

1005
00:42:58,319 --> 00:42:59,200
to begin with

1006
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:04,000
it's because like well you know we all

1007
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
are participants in life and we'd like

1008
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,119
that to be

1009
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,839
nicer by whatever metric we think that

1010
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:11,359
is

1011
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:14,160
and you know use the tools make it

1012
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,440
better

1013
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,480
um so that one i i

1014
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,839
like as a starting point because

1015
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:24,079
it basically includes all technology

1016
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:26,240
ever developed

1017
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,520
because no technology exists

1018
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,800
outside of humanity

1019
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:37,280
it's all purpose driven and i think that

1020
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,560
you know when thinking about sort of

1021
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,319
like okay what's a cyborg

1022
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:43,839
and and and what is you know

1023
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:45,839
what is the cybernetic side of

1024
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:47,119
biohacking and

1025
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:49,680
and what is the organic side of

1026
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,520
biohacking

1027
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,200
you know and there are plenty of details

1028
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,640
you can get into in terms of

1029
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,000
what that is but to really remember that

1030
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,119
all technology ever developed

1031
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,240
is there to serve humanity

1032
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:08,640
or at least should be and

1033
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,160
the only reason any of it was ever

1034
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,480
created was was for that reason

1035
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,760
at least in theory so we're all

1036
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,880
biohackers

1037
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,160
and since the very first hominid shipped

1038
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,200
out a

1039
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,680
a spear tip from obsidian

1040
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,480
i'm going to counter you because i live

1041
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,760
go ahead

1042
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,079
you you brought in technology and i

1043
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:35,839
don't necessarily agree that it has to

1044
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,200
be with technology

1045
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,640
because sometimes it can just be that

1046
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,079
knowledge which is not necessarily

1047
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:40,880
tangible

1048
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,680
something not something but it's

1049
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,640
something you can

1050
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,640
you can take in so like at the

1051
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,400
biohacking village one of the premises

1052
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,400
that we work off of is improving

1053
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:50,960
knowledge

1054
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,640
improving patient care improving better

1055
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,640
technology and doing all those things

1056
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,920
and

1057
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,000
that's why when people ask me you know

1058
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,079
so what's biohacking

1059
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:02,400
i will never reply my question always is

1060
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,520
what is it to you

1061
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,880
because i need to know a lot of people's

1062
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,079
starting points um so that i can say yes

1063
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:09,760
you are absolutely right because this is

1064
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,359
what you think and

1065
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:15,040
whatever um and then add on

1066
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,960
my frame of reference to it as well um

1067
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,880
yeah i think i think that's totally

1068
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,240
valid i think that's a good

1069
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,440
a good definition i would even go so far

1070
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,119
as to suggest that i think that

1071
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:30,560
our those two definitions aren't in

1072
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,920
conflict because arguably

1073
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,720
written word is human created technology

1074
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,240
and so when we talk about

1075
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,960
information and language that's

1076
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:41,520
something

1077
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,839
that while it might be something that's

1078
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:45,359
organically developed

1079
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:48,079
rather than an artifact of abstract

1080
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:48,960
thought

1081
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,920
that still we're utilizing something

1082
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:52,240
that

1083
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,880
is while not perhaps uniquely human

1084
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,599
something that is

1085
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,480
an important center point of humanity

1086
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:06,720
i think a lot about

1087
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,880
how the community interacts with each

1088
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:09,760
other

1089
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,640
but the community to me is is very broad

1090
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,640
because when i start

1091
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,680
every conversation um when i give a talk

1092
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,480
it's always who's an engineer who's

1093
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,920
who's a physician

1094
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,800
whose software who who does what and

1095
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,720
who's a patient and like one or two

1096
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,839
people will raise their hand at their

1097
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,560
patients

1098
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,000
and that's not completely true because

1099
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,079
we're all patients we're all patients

1100
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:33,920
exactly from that data point that one

1101
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,359
data point per year

1102
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,560
nothing else um so i i keep looking over

1103
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,920
here because this is where i keep

1104
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,599
my brain thoughts i have a black boy

1105
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:43,280
that i wear coffee and

1106
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,520
i feel like i have mine on this side

1107
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,960
right so

1108
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,160
i feel like we as citizen scientists we

1109
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,200
as um hacker folks right researchers

1110
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,599
whether it be in security or biologicals

1111
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:58,640
um we have to broaden

1112
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,280
the the community that we work in as in

1113
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,079
absolutely

1114
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:05,040
more fellowship because at the end of

1115
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,160
the day

1116
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,680
we have to work together to to do better

1117
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,040
creation

1118
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,760
to formulate better tech and to improve

1119
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,680
everybody's life

1120
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,000
yeah and i think that this exact point

1121
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,119
is not

1122
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,480
stressed enough because there's this

1123
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,520
this really uh this

1124
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,960
really paternalistic kind of old-school

1125
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,559
mythology

1126
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,960
that is pervasive from silicon valley of

1127
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:33,920
like the lone

1128
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,800
genius white guy who comes up with a

1129
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,000
brilliant idea and

1130
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,960
sets the world on fire and we all know

1131
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:41,760
that that's

1132
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,160
a false narrative that doesn't happen

1133
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,920
great things happen because

1134
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,319
people get together and work together

1135
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,880
and develop ideas in concert

1136
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,920
and the only way that that can happen is

1137
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,280
if we do everything we can to support

1138
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,000
each other and to connect people

1139
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,480
nothing happens without all of that i

1140
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,200
love that

1141
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,599
um i am i'm particularly fond of when

1142
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,119
people like oh well who you know who's

1143
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:08,400
on your team and they don't really want

1144
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,760
me there and i'm like no we want

1145
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,119
everybody involved

1146
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,599
because just any any tech it doesn't

1147
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,119
matter what kind of tech it is even if

1148
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:16,559
it's a watch you still have to have that

1149
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:18,160
human interaction to say how does it

1150
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:18,640
feel

1151
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,319
does it fit well how does it look when

1152
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:21,920
you when you use it um

1153
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,079
normal everyday things but when we're

1154
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:26,480
talking about biological anythings

1155
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,000
because there's a human at the end and

1156
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,599
the beginning of this because it's

1157
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,760
right um at least for for like medical

1158
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,280
devices it's

1159
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,520
physician patient physician patient and

1160
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,960
then if it's the biohackers of

1161
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,640
whoever we're working within ourselves

1162
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,960
because we primarily work on ourselves

1163
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,079
to ensure

1164
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:45,200
um it works safety yeah right right

1165
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:45,599
right

1166
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,720
so i love

1167
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,119
that the the team dynamics that we as

1168
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:52,240
citizen scientists

1169
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,280
we as biohackers diy biologists

1170
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,680
we don't look at this as this is just a

1171
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,559
bio project

1172
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:00,160
i'm not interested in whatever you have

1173
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,440
to say because you're just an engineer

1174
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,400
and it's like you're not just an

1175
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,920
engineer you weren't you're needed in

1176
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,200
this group

1177
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,280
um everything is needed i think that's

1178
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,480
one of the things that's so exciting

1179
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,520
about it is that it

1180
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,119
you have to include like every facet of

1181
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:13,839
science

1182
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:16,000
or you're it's not gonna work you need

1183
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,520
all the pieces

1184
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,720
okay expanding on that so because a lot

1185
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,280
of us are

1186
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,839
self-taught i think it's just so much

1187
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:24,800
more dynamic

1188
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,800
because it's it's i learned a thing i

1189
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,480
either saw it on youtube or i read it or

1190
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,680
i tried it

1191
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,880
can i replicate it can i make that same

1192
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,480
situation up and again and again and

1193
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,400
again and then we learn about

1194
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,559
specificity and sensitivity

1195
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,480
and ensuring that whatever we're working

1196
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,400
on can carry that all the way through

1197
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,520
the same way that

1198
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,079
that medical science does and i love

1199
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:47,599
that our community

1200
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,640
can get to that level and be on par and

1201
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,880
say we did a thing

1202
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,480
oh and not only that but

1203
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,000
we do it better and faster and cheaper

1204
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,520
and more efficiently

1205
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,480
and that's sort of the magic of the sort

1206
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,000
of

1207
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,920
counter cultural structure that we've

1208
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,440
managed to build

1209
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,720
where we can say look

1210
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,440
we can use all the same tools that mit

1211
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,720
and harvard use

1212
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:20,240
and we can do it for 100 the price

1213
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,119
and we can do it twice the speed who do

1214
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:24,640
you want to talk to

1215
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:28,160
take your pick we're here

1216
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,119
i love that we do that

1217
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,839
i love that we do that simultaneously

1218
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:41,200
it's how do we get

1219
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,720
more heard i don't even know if that's a

1220
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,400
real sentence how do we get

1221
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,200
heard more how do we get better heard

1222
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:47,839
well yeah

1223
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:51,359
i think that's a big thing and i think

1224
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:52,960
like even the fact that i said it that

1225
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,960
way of like oh mit does this as though

1226
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,319
this were some like appropriate

1227
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:57,680
comparative

1228
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,920
when it's really not when really it

1229
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:00,880
should be like

1230
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,119
we're cool and you should recognize this

1231
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:04,720
without having to like say

1232
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:08,160
oh the authority figure that you bow to

1233
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,200
were just as good or better i think that

1234
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,640
it needs to get to the point

1235
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:16,480
where there's more

1236
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:20,480
broad recognition that we as a community

1237
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,800
do what we do as we do it

1238
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,359
yes and it's just like here we are we're

1239
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,119
doing stuff all the time

1240
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:32,480
and it's amazing things that everybody

1241
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,680
is doing

1242
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:38,319
and you just need to get on board

1243
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:42,079
i i have three questions that i try to

1244
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:43,680
ask everybody that i have interviews

1245
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:44,880
with

1246
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,240
okay i'm ready answering one sentence

1247
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:52,319
one or two okay all right what

1248
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:53,920
what is the hardest lesson you've had to

1249
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,839
learn through

1250
00:51:55,839 --> 00:52:00,160
through everything that you've worked on

1251
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,839
the hardest lesson also i don't prepare

1252
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:06,079
people for these questions

1253
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:09,839
so please the hardest lesson

1254
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:14,319
had to learn throughout the process

1255
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,599
um gosh

1256
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:21,440
i don't i'm not sure i mean that's

1257
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,200
that's a long list of hard lessons that

1258
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,480
i've had to learn here and then

1259
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,680
even to your mind first

1260
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,760
the one that i think of which i don't

1261
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,040
think is the hard

1262
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,559
it wasn't a hard lesson but it's the

1263
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:34,720
most important lesson

1264
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,760
is that when

1265
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:41,920
you are trying to

1266
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,559
get a consortium of people to work when

1267
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,040
you're trying to do things

1268
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:51,040
organizationally

1269
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,559
the thing that i think most people

1270
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:58,079
neglect and something that i take a lot

1271
00:52:58,079 --> 00:52:58,400
of

1272
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,240
pride in getting

1273
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,440
right a lot of the time is

1274
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,760
that the very most important thing that

1275
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,040
you need to do

1276
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,920
in an organization is take care of the

1277
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,680
people involved when you are

1278
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,520
whether no matter how formal it is

1279
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,280
whether you found a company

1280
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,040
or whether you have a collective or

1281
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,880
whether you have some side project it's

1282
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,760
like a loose organization of friends

1283
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,880
whatever it is before you do anything

1284
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,800
related to the actual project

1285
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,280
the thing you need to do first is you

1286
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,960
need to make sure

1287
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,280
that everybody that you're working with

1288
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,880
is doing okay

1289
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,040
and this comes into even sharper focus

1290
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,200
in you know recent times because

1291
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,359
everybody's having such a hard time

1292
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:50,800
and you can't you can't get anything

1293
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,079
done if you're racked with grief because

1294
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:56,000
the world's on fire you can't get

1295
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:56,559
anything

1296
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:59,599
done if you are

1297
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:01,040
dealing with the fact that your pet's

1298
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,880
sick you can't get anything done

1299
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,160
if you're stressed about your car

1300
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,480
payments or whatever it is so

1301
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,040
if you're if you know as as a as

1302
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,040
something to pass on

1303
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,319
the most important lesson i think is

1304
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:16,400
if you want to get a project done you

1305
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,520
get everybody to sign

1306
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,680
on and then you don't talk about the

1307
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,760
project you sit down with everybody and

1308
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,760
you say what do you need to make life

1309
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,720
easier

1310
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,640
what is the biggest block to your

1311
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,960
bandwidth what is the tool that will

1312
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,240
make everything

1313
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:34,720
less time consuming how can we do that

1314
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:39,359
so what is your unpopular opinion

1315
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,720
what's my unpopular opinion

1316
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:45,920
um i got a lot of them but i think my

1317
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,440
most unpopular opinion

1318
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,760
is that there should be no code of

1319
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:50,839
ethics

1320
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:54,240
surrounding biohacking

1321
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:58,319
i think that it's a huge huge misstep

1322
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:00,880
to set down a code of ethics i think

1323
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,880
it's important to have decision making

1324
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,839
guides

1325
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:07,440
because what we want

1326
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,280
is we want people to make ethical

1327
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,559
decisions

1328
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:12,160
we don't want people making ethical

1329
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,839
decisions because somebody else decided

1330
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:15,599
what was ethical and what wasn't

1331
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:17,440
and said if you don't you're in big

1332
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,960
trouble

1333
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,880
what we want is we want people to make

1334
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,559
ethical decisions because it's the right

1335
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:23,760
thing to do

1336
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,920
and they understand why and they've

1337
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,119
thought about it carefully

1338
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:30,480
and so the right thing to do

1339
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:35,839
is to help people understand

1340
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:38,319
the repercussions of certain decisions

1341
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:39,520
whether you make them one way or the

1342
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,400
other

1343
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,359
and have those people make those

1344
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,079
decisions

1345
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:48,240
for themselves critically that's the key

1346
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,760
i find that interesting and intriguing

1347
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:57,200
because um along with this

1348
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,000
laws tend to not change very frequently

1349
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,599
or very well

1350
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:04,480
and they're they're antiquated and don't

1351
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,599
change over into

1352
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:08,079
how technology has changed and how human

1353
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:09,520
viewpoints have changed and how the

1354
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,200
world has acclimated to all of these

1355
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,559
things

1356
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:15,359
so i i can understand where you're going

1357
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,319
with that

1358
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:18,319
and well and also it's it's a it's an

1359
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:19,680
artifact of of

1360
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,480
uh retributive justice right because the

1361
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,920
thing is as soon as you say

1362
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,559
oh if you do this then this happens to

1363
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:27,040
you

1364
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,559
then it's just a medium of exchange

1365
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,160
saying like well if i don't mind that

1366
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,680
i'm in a lot of trouble

1367
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,520
then it means i can go do this horribly

1368
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,599
unethical thing like that's not why you

1369
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:37,119
want people to be making their decisions

1370
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:39,119
based on you want people to be deciding

1371
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:40,160
like oh

1372
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,599
i don't want to do this unethical thing

1373
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:42,720
because it's going to ruin a lot of

1374
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,400
people's lives or it's really

1375
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,599
dangerous and it might hurt people or it

1376
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:50,160
you know any number of other things that

1377
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,440
you're doing it because

1378
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:55,200
it you know that it feels right and it's

1379
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,480
you're building the world you want to

1380
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,040
live in

1381
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,960
not because you're being selfish and

1382
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,960
acting out of fear

1383
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,319
i want to end this on a plot twist

1384
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:04,960
because everybody loves those um

1385
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,559
so when you talked about the epi pencil

1386
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:10,880
you talked about it on the adrenaline

1387
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:11,599
and and

1388
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:13,040
and all the other chemicals that go

1389
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,640
inside it and and the

1390
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,160
mechanism so i've also worked in um

1391
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:21,040
like microfluidics and nanoparticles and

1392
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,240
molecular science

1393
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,480
and i've done hardware stuff so i tend

1394
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,480
to think that people just going back to

1395
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,760
something we talked about earlier i tend

1396
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:28,880
to think that people

1397
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,319
sort of put us in boxes of well if your

1398
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:35,359
your bio hacking thing is you do this

1399
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:37,760
so i'm gonna put you here and it's we're

1400
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,839
broader than that right like if you i

1401
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:41,359
mean you and i have had conversations

1402
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:42,000
about

1403
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,280
things on a particle level and then

1404
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,440
we're also like oh did you see my peg

1405
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,799
leg which if you don't know what the peg

1406
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,680
leg is you should

1407
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,920
do you want to talk about it just we can

1408
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,599
end on that

1409
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:56,400
i mean we can so again it's it's like

1410
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,200
you said

1411
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:01,040
you know we're the

1412
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,680
the term biohacking is is typically

1413
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,520
limiting right because people think it

1414
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,160
means only so many things where

1415
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,200
people that are in our community are

1416
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,160
trying to get

1417
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,599
stuff done it kind of doesn't matter how

1418
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:15,839
we get it done right it's oh here's

1419
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:17,359
something interesting let's try it

1420
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:18,799
because it means that

1421
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:20,480
things could be different things could

1422
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,880
be better how do we make that change

1423
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,040
how do we broaden everyone else's

1424
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,319
viewpoint of

1425
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:28,240
um because again a lot of people have

1426
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,160
the the initiation that introduction is

1427
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,119
chips

1428
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:34,079
but also have they thought about how the

1429
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:35,520
ships are made because it's not just

1430
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,040
like you slam a chip inside you don't

1431
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,319
take your phone and slam it into your

1432
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:39,040
skin and you're like

1433
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:42,319
i've chip it's it's that there's there's

1434
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:45,680
a small uh ferdinand ferdinand fair

1435
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,559
um iron there's iron there's a small

1436
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:50,000
piece of iron

1437
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,880
that's wrapped around and and it's it's

1438
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,079
also covered by

1439
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:57,760
um bio bio glass

1440
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:01,200
and this is checked against your body

1441
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,799
to make sure that one it's not gonna

1442
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:05,119
crack if you hit your hand on something

1443
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:07,599
that your body isn't going to reject it

1444
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:10,000
and there's a lot more thought that goes

1445
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,799
into a lot of what we work on just to

1446
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,160
make sure that it's biologically

1447
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,599
sustainable

1448
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:17,280
right i've had the same argument it's

1449
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,880
not an argument but i've had the same

1450
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:19,680
the same

1451
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,079
discussion with people but i'm like you

1452
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:23,520
don't just put a pacemaker

1453
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,880
it's not a clock like you can't just

1454
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,640
throw a tick tock into your into your

1455
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,640
chest and you're like i'm in i'm good

1456
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,799
it's there's a lot of science that goes

1457
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:33,200
behind it

1458
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,799
well to your question of how do we make

1459
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:37,760
it better i think the way we

1460
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,480
make it better is by making it more

1461
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,280
inclusive

1462
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,839
i think that's the key i think that we

1463
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:45,200
need to make

1464
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,240
the environment more welcoming

1465
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,640
i think we need to make people unafraid

1466
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,079
to get involved

1467
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:56,000
i think i think the

1468
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,040
shift that happened in the computer

1469
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,160
hacking community

1470
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:03,359
in like the late 90s that went from like

1471
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:03,839
oh

1472
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:06,559
let's let's mess with the noobs and be

1473
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:07,200
mean

1474
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,160
to if anybody has a question be gentle

1475
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,040
try and

1476
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:14,160
make things feel inclusive try and make

1477
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:17,280
people feel welcome have a good process

1478
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,119
that we can walk people through

1479
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:21,280
have good documentation so that people

1480
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,280
can get involved more easily

1481
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,280
i think that's key technologies we do

1482
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:29,200
not document well i mean

1483
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,000
i would take that even further and say

1484
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,520
if you do

1485
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:36,640
science and don't document it's not

1486
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:37,280
science

1487
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,839
you failed

1488
01:00:40,839 --> 01:00:44,000
so i i wait that

1489
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,160
you've seen them the harry potter movie

1490
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,040
when he

1491
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,480
he has a book i don't remember which

1492
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,160
movie it is right now but he gets the

1493
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:50,960
old book and

1494
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,920
and ron gets the new book and in the old

1495
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:54,640
book the guy

1496
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,480
the the kid scratched some things out

1497
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,319
and it's like use two cups of whatever

1498
01:00:58,319 --> 01:00:59,200
it is but the

1499
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,839
the scratched out instructions the

1500
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:03,440
scratched in instructions

1501
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:07,119
say like don't use 1.5 cups of whatever

1502
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:08,000
it is and he

1503
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,359
he he just gets it he nails every potion

1504
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:13,680
i tell people it's like that it's you're

1505
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,119
gonna keep scratching things out

1506
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:16,559
because you're gonna eventually get it

1507
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:19,200
all together and when you scratch those

1508
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,400
things out and you write

1509
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,160
margins in the notes and notes in the

1510
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,079
margins you need to

1511
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:25,839
share those with everybody so that

1512
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:28,079
everybody has those notes

1513
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:30,880
so i do want to end it on this i think

1514
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:31,680
covid

1515
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,960
has like you said everybody's in their

1516
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,480
mind space right now but i think we're

1517
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,000
also thinking about science and

1518
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,359
technology more

1519
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:41,839
because we all got sent home and we're

1520
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:43,599
working from home and we can't go to the

1521
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:44,960
doctor so now

1522
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,960
telehealth and digital health have

1523
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,640
really done something more robust

1524
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,160
because we had to have that instant

1525
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,280
turnaround

1526
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:55,359
and now because of how science has gone

1527
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:58,319
there's there's that like what's going

1528
01:01:58,319 --> 01:01:59,440
on moment

1529
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,599
um do i understand it do i not so more

1530
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:03,520
people are getting interested in science

1531
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,799
because they're trying to understand

1532
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,520
what's going on

1533
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,319
and i personally love that shift that

1534
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:09,920
dynamic that's taken over because now

1535
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:10,960
it's not just

1536
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,640
mitochondria is the powerhouse of the

1537
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,000
cell it's

1538
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,559
you know with the royal virus corona

1539
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:18,079
means crown and you know

1540
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:20,720
the latinos that um and let and you know

1541
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,240
if you did science you understand that

1542
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,839
so let you know it's a crown and

1543
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:26,240
and this is what happens and i think now

1544
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:29,039
that we're going to have this region

1545
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:32,720
because we had an opportunity to say

1546
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:35,520
science is cool and look at how science

1547
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:35,920
has

1548
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,799
has shifted all the things we we can be

1549
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:40,000
in a better place

1550
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,799
especially with healthcare and i think

1551
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:44,160
about that

1552
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,599
especially in the way that i work

1553
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:48,559
because i believe in guerrilla warfare

1554
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:49,599
and all things

1555
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:53,280
when you are set when you are beset

1556
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,079
with a set of obstacles and suddenly

1557
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:57,680
there are all these things that can't be

1558
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,359
done anymore

1559
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:01,039
how do you use your weaknesses to

1560
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:03,359
strengths and i think that

1561
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:06,480
in such a global crisis like

1562
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,119
that needs to be the mentality or we're

1563
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:12,079
all just going to crumble

1564
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,160
i'm going to leave it there because

1565
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,160
that's something to think about so i

1566
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,079
love you thank you for being with me

1567
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:20,319
