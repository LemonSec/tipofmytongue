1
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,120
continuous

2
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,840
foreign

3
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,840
foreign

4
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,840
is

5
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,840
is

6
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:04,320
here's the scenario for you jason and 
pleased to meet you again and 8.8 is  

7
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:13,520
waiting for you a nice presentation oh thank you 
very much for having me uh i want to just uh say  

8
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:19,200
i i mean i know these are unusual times it's like 
i am very disappointed that i i don't get to be  

9
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:25,200
there in person i was uh this was one of the trips 
i was looking forward to uh in the before times  

10
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,000
uh but unfortunately uh it couldn't happen but 
hopefully we'll get our act together and people  

11
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,040
will start taking this more seriously next year 
and we can get this uh knocked out and i can visit  

12
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:42,560
you and give out some actual awkward hugs uh in 
person instead of virtually um so thanks for being  

13
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,120
here the uh the talk is called the problems with 
spoons and live hacking and infosec and basically  

14
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:56,000
uh what it did was i i bought a a motorcycle last 
year uh uh well it's a trike and uh i called it  

15
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,360
talon and it's like and i got a matrix skin on it 
and that got me watching the matrix again and i  

16
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,520
was in the process of trying to figure out what my 
rant was going to be because i alternate between  

17
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,840
a rant year and an offensive talk year and 
well most people say my talks are offensive but  

18
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,799
uh this was where i talk about technical stuff 
so it's like so it's like this is a rant year  

19
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:23,120
and boy 2020 has given us a lot to rant about 
right so uh perfect timing for that uh so i  

20
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,320
uh i started uh re-watching the matrix and i 
realized that it would help me a lot with what  

21
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,680
i wanted to talk about this year and so i can put 
it in there and i did a theme talk before uh with  

22
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,640
breaking uh breaking bad and that was like hit or 
miss because some people haven't watched breaking  

23
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:44,159
bad but most of people at hacker cons have seen 
the matrix so i should be in pretty safe territory  

24
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,000
i do apologize i'm american so i only speak one 
language i'm from texas so i don't speak it very  

25
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,800
well but i will make up for that by speaking 
very loud and very fast so i i hope that helps  

26
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:04,000
uh it usually doesn't but let's continue uh this 
is about me uh it's the least interesting slide  

27
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,160
and i've got way more stuff to talk about so 
i'm not going to really go into it uh check me  

28
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:15,280
on twitter if you want to know more about me uh 
jasonestreet.com that's enough i hack i uh i help  

29
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:25,280
uh and i hug so let's get into it hacking one 
of the biggest questions i get uh in my dms and  

30
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,960
all these other places it's like and all these 
uh contact forms like is i want to be a hacker  

31
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,880
it's like how do i become a hacker and i'm 
like you are a hacker because like from  

32
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,000
inventors against the visionaries to criminals 
history is a cycle of defining those who value  

33
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,440
fight being fight we keep trying to say what a 
hacker is when basically it's just human nature  

34
00:06:50,080 --> 00:07:00,640
we're using the term hacker to describe curiosity 
to describe invention to describe inspirational  

35
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:05,120
thinking to describe this is how the world 
has told me something is supposed to be  

36
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:14,480
but i want to do it differently this is how i was 
told that things have to be done but why can't it  

37
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:24,000
be done this way that right there is hacking you 
were born a hacker with that innate curiosity of  

38
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,600
making things different sometimes it's like people 
get grow out of it they get ground out of them  

39
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:37,680
it's like but it's still that it's all in all it's 
in all of us it's like it is a hundred percent  

40
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:44,400
nothing to do with computers it has to do with 
the brain it has to do with that innate human  

41
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,719
curiosity that we hold on to and hackers are just 
really good at holding on to it and keeping that  

42
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:58,160
childlike sense of let's try to make this do 
something different so that is what hacking is  

43
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,600
and if you want to hear more about my ranting on 
this check out my defcon 2022 talk on youtube and  

44
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:11,600
on my website because that is literally talking 
about what being a hacker really is uh but  

45
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:18,880
what people really want to ask is when they're 
asking me i want to be a hacker is what they're  

46
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:27,600
asking is how do i make money being a hacker and 
then i'm like oh that's what you're interested in  

47
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,039
it's like so you're not interested in just 
being a hacker you're looking for infosec  

48
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:39,839
you're looking for uh a paycheck it's like 
which is admirable i mean that's how i started  

49
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,400
it's like it's like like i said i've always 
been a hacker but it's like i started getting  

50
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,959
a paycheck from hacking from doing security 
from doing computer security from doing the  

51
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:55,040
computer side of it it's like 20 years ago 
and that's when i started the the being on  

52
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:01,520
the blue team and so i'm like okay well you 
there is no one path everybody wants you know  

53
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:09,200
uh to have the key master it's like and and help 
us out it's like uh it's like and it just doesn't  

54
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,960
work that way it's like there is no one key to 
success there is no one path that's going to suit  

55
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:22,400
you and make it work and the whole point is you 
have to work at it you have to look at it and you  

56
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:29,360
have to find what path you want to take in this 
journey it's like sorry it's you're not like neo  

57
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,240
you don't get to download it into from the matrix 
i mean tesla you know elon musk is trying to get  

58
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:41,200
it with that brain implant so it can just like 
i know kung fu awesome uh but not here just yet  

59
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,400
thank goodness uh so you have to understand it's 
like you don't get it just an instant answer  

60
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,560
there is no just an instant download to get 
this information on how to be a hacker how to  

61
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,199
be an information security how to work 
uh and do the career that you want and  

62
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:05,520
no matter what even if it was downloaded remember 
it's like he learned kung fu but was he good at it  

63
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:14,560
at first no because he still had to practice 
he still had to put what he was taught  

64
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:25,040
into action you can't just read the books and 
say i know kung fu you can't just read the uh  

65
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:34,400
the manuals take a test get a cert and say oh 
i'm now an information security i'm now a hacker  

66
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:40,800
it doesn't work that way you have to work at 
it you have to put time and effort into it  

67
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:49,520
and more importantly it's like you have to 
fail you have to fail at it let's make failing  

68
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:58,240
cool again you know it's like what's wrong 
with failing it's like that's how you learn  

69
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,880
that's how you understand oh i shouldn't have 
done it that way what is another way to do it  

70
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:13,120
it's like we get so you you see so many talks at 
these conferences it's like where it's like oh  

71
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,120
and this is how i did this and i created it 
and i'm like well that doesn't work with me  

72
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,960
it's like what happens when it does that mistake 
it's like i don't want to talk about that because  

73
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:28,160
then you won't look as cool otherwise i did a 
whole talk one year on nothing but my failures  

74
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:34,240
because we learn from that others can learn 
from that stop being shy about failing  

75
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:41,440
you're human unfortunately all of us are 
right it's like i can't help that it's like  

76
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:49,680
uh try as i might to deny it but we are it's 
like so we're gonna make mistakes it's not  

77
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:57,760
a loss if it's a lesson so start making those 
lessons and start sharing those lessons as well  

78
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:03,760
to others so it's like you're gonna fail you're 
gonna keep trying it's like i am not smarter  

79
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,600
than anybody in this industry okay it's like i 
have like literally it's like people look at me  

80
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:17,280
and think i'm sick no i'm not successful 
i'm stubborn i just am too petty to quit  

81
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:26,720
it's like i get a fail and i keep going and i try 
to learn from it i have just started again more  

82
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:35,600
than i failed and that's what's made me successful 
somewhat okay is just the fact that i kept going  

83
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,360
not because i kept learning like that or like or 
just you know understanding all these things no  

84
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,120
i'm just stubborn i just kept going past 
the fail and i didn't let that stop me

85
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:57,680
but that's how this talk was going at the 
very beginning of the year in the before times  

86
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,720
i literally have a talk that's actually been 
recorded that was actually in front of actual real  

87
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,600
people and like conferences where you actually 
went and you saw people and you were on stage  

88
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,960
and i've got a video of that talk if you want to 
see that and that was more helpful and that was  

89
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:21,600
more um it was still ranty it was still renting 
but it was a little bit more educational uh it  

90
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,760
was less uh vitriol but i'm it's early morning 
for me uh i get salty in the mornings anyway  

91
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,840
and i'm pretty effing pissed off uh this 
week uh with a lot that's going on this slide  

92
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,079
that was at in a different section of the of 
the of the talk uh just yesterday i switched  

93
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,960
all the slides around today these are all brand 
new uh it's a brand new format uh for me so it's  

94
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:51,600
like i might be missing up a couple places where 
i'm supposed to be but basically this slide was  

95
00:13:51,600 --> 00:14:02,720
a slide where i went and talked to hackers and 
told them about how infosec needed to be cut a  

96
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,080
break how we needed to be nicer to infosec and 
stop just making infosec sound like they're not  

97
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,440
doing a job or like they're just corporate uh 
drones that are just they're i i talked about  

98
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,960
how they were necessary and they were needed and 
i compared it to the the the people in zion it's  

99
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,160
like they're in the matrix right now you see them 
in all the white rooms and stuff because it's  

100
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,000
only in virtually that you can wear all white 
like that and not have to worry about it right  

101
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,640
it's like uh and then you got the the hackers that 
are like out there on the field and like they're  

102
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:35,600
like more edgy and more dirty and they're like 
but but they're the same they're doing the same  

103
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,400
tasks they're trying to protect zion they're 
still risking their lives people in the in  

104
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:47,680
the matrix in zion died at the docks correct it's 
like so i was talk i was going to talk about that  

105
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,440
but then i started getting all this pushback 
and keep hearing and reinforcement from  

106
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:02,240
infosec people about what hackers are 
and hackers are equivalent to criminals  

107
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,880
and mother don't come to me with 
that noise because i'm not having it  

108
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,240
it's like you want to talk about 
differences between infosec and hackers  

109
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,120
practice hackers are the ones putting in 
the work creating the research and creating  

110
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,000
and discovering the vulnerabilities they don't 
make the vulnerabilities but they discover them  

111
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:31,280
those vulnerabilities were already there they just 
found them and were nice enough to display it and  

112
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:37,040
work on it and show them you think any hacker or 
any kind of uh person goes out and delivers these  

113
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,880
tools that are then trained and taught by infosec 
people that they're doing it just because they  

114
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:50,720
want to use it to give to criminals no criminals 
already have these techniques criminals already  

115
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:57,520
have tools that they've made they haven't shared 
you think metasploit is a criminal tool mother  

116
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:04,959
metasploit has helped more blue teamers than 
anyone ever did it's like uh for a criminal  

117
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:11,280
mass voice not used by criminals as much as 
it is used by blue team because blue teams  

118
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:15,839
don't understand the concepts and what's 
done and how to create those shells and how  

119
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:22,720
to create those scripts and how to chain those 
vulnerabilities to make it exploit so mess boy  

120
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:30,160
gave them all rolled up into it how many freaking 
infosec products use nmap inside their engine  

121
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:41,680
thank you theodore it's like how much credit does 
he get i am so tired of infosec professionals and  

122
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:49,839
infosec institutions that are using work 
made for from with tools made by hackers  

123
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:56,160
freely distributed to the public and 
then they want to crap on hackers  

124
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:03,840
and associate them with criminals what's 
criminal is the exploitation of the hacker's work  

125
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:11,120
and you writing this off as nobody that's criminal

126
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:18,879
hackers are not the ones committing crime 
if i get robbed by somebody with a gun  

127
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,520
i don't automatically assume that they're 
a gunsmith that they wouldn't crafted that  

128
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,440
gun and then they're robbing me with it no 
other criminals are lazy they grab the gun  

129
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,360
because it's easier to commit crime with 
and guess what computers have made crime  

130
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:39,919
really really effing easy so these might 
download a tool they get off the internet  

131
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:46,720
the dark web it's like they didn't watch a 
youtube video on it it's like and then they  

132
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,520
launched their account and then oh i'm a hacker 
now no you're not mother you're a criminal that  

133
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:57,760
is using tools and not a lot of those aren't 
even hacking tools they're just tools used  

134
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,200
it's like if you want to make hackers 
responsible for the criminal tools out there  

135
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,240
they want to give them some effing credit for all 
the different security products that are out there  

136
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:14,960
that were made by open source hacking products 
and made those uh your selling products possible

137
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:22,000
i mean look at openback look at nasa's look 
at all these other tools that are out there  

138
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:30,639
that were founded on open source hacking tools 
to make things better you can't have in your  

139
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,720
books that you train people saying that hackers 
are criminals or hackers mean script kitties  

140
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,960
and in the three pages over say okay class 
now we're going to use john the ripper  

141
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:52,960
mother do you not see the irony and the 
hypocrisy in that i'm tired of it i'm done  

142
00:18:54,080 --> 00:19:02,320
it's like i have always been a hacker i've had 20 
years in infosec it's like there doesn't have to  

143
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:10,800
be one or the other but by gosh there has to 
be respect from both sides and it's like and  

144
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:16,480
i've started this message at the beginning of the 
year trying to tell hackers to be more respectful  

145
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,840
of infosec well mother when is infoset going 
to be a little bit more respectful to hackers  

146
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:29,280
telling people that they gotta uh stop worrying 
about the term being used oh you have to you  

147
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,560
shouldn't be so upset about you know uh hackers 
be quite you need to get over it you need to use  

148
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:40,000
the term security researcher instead that's 
a much perfect you don't tell me what label i  

149
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:47,600
call myself you don't get to name me mother 
when you talk like that you better not have my  

150
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,840
name come out of your mouth 
because i don't want to hear it

151
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:03,920
we need to understand that infosec provides 
a great career choices they provide a lot of  

152
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,240
work and they do a lot of stuff that is 
necessary to keep the internet running  

153
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:15,440
and mother infosec needs to start understanding 
and respecting the job that hackers do  

154
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:23,920
to keep everybody safe the role that hackers 
play in keeping the internet safe from criminals  

155
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:30,320
from criminals who are committing crimes 
on the internet and you one other jason  

156
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,639
why do you keep why is this the hill you die 
this is always going to be the hill i die on  

157
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:43,040
this is always going to be the windmill i 
killed until all these ignorant arrogant  

158
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:51,120
infosec people get out of their little tall little 
castles and understand what the real world's like

159
00:20:53,440 --> 00:21:00,800
okay so oh you can also go to ironin and find 
out more information and also go to hacknotcrime  

160
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:06,320
on twitter to learn more um but that's the 
first part i'm not done yet by the way just  

161
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,760
i'm giving you a breather uh because let's talk 
about gatekeeping which is the reason why it's  

162
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:19,760
such a great segment from uh infosec i hear 
so many people in this uh community in this  

163
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:26,160
industry that want to be like mio it's like 
you know the officer i remember alexis park  

164
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:35,280
defcon 12 people showing up in the middle of the 
desert in summer wearing a neo leather trench coat  

165
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:42,720
they were dropping like flies but they look cool 
they were neo it's like they were in the mother  

166
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,800
you're not in the matrix you need air conditioning 
you're gonna die but that didn't stop them  

167
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:54,080
uh i'm pretty sure alcohol is involved in a lot 
of that but still bad poor decisions are made  

168
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,919
a lot of poor decisions were made at def con at 
lexis park involving alcohol i don't recommend it  

169
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:06,640
so that's the problem everybody wants to 
be neo then why is it every time people get  

170
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,440
credibility people start getting up people 
start getting recognized for their work  

171
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,680
they all of a sudden they start becoming agent 
smith oh that's not a real hacker conference  

172
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:23,600
that's more of a cosplay conference now oh you're 
not really a hacker unless you know how to do this  

173
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,040
it's like oh you don't know the comment what kind 
of hacker are you oh you have to use mother why  

174
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:40,399
why be that way that's not how it's supposed to 
be i don't care how it's been that's not the way  

175
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:47,840
it's supposed to be and one of the key things 
that i've seen so often is the self gatekeeping  

176
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:56,399
we have so many in this community that are so 
overwhelmed by all these big names and all these  

177
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,800
big exploits and all these big researchers that 
they're like oh no one's gonna be interested in  

178
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:05,200
my stuff it's like oh i don't really know if i'm a 
hacker i can't do that stuff that they're talking  

179
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:15,360
about who gives a you're a hacker i was talking 
at a conference uh it was uh la hack in paris  

180
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,120
and i was talking to a very good friend who's won 
the corp conference organizers for la hack one of  

181
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:28,000
the best hacking conferences in europe that i've 
been to and he he talks to me about how he'd done  

182
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,960
a distributed kismet wireless ids system how he 
had worked on all these different products and  

183
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,720
how he's worked with the wifi talking about all 
these accomplishments that he's done at his job  

184
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:45,919
and literally 15 minutes later in the conversation 
he shares with me like well you know jason i do  

185
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:51,440
not feel sometimes like i am a hacker it's like i 
feel like i'm just doing this work and i want to  

186
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,320
be uh a hacker but i don't think i have anything 
to say and i'm like i do terrible accents by the  

187
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,600
way sorry no offense to the french but you know 
what it's like i looked at him dumbfounded like  

188
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:07,120
are you having kidding me you just told me all 
the things you were doing how is that not hacking  

189
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,160
you hacked together a system how is that 
not hacking but he was self-gatekeeping  

190
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:21,920
he wasn't even giving a chance for these other 
arrogant sobs to keep them he was doing it himself  

191
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:31,520
you need to understand that you have something 
to share you have something to teach in this  

192
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:38,879
community it may have been given a hundred times 
but you may have a perception you may have a a  

193
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:47,760
a different uh approach that clicks with someone 
we need more diversity in this community not less  

194
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:56,239
the more differing opinions that we get the more 
different uh ideas that we get the better we are

195
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:06,320
we need to work on that and we need to stop 
being a-holes involve people we have a dire skill  

196
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,879
shortage how do we get more people interested 
in security someone who's interested in security  

197
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:20,400
hey sorry quick question how do i infosec people 
lol noob idiot gtfo is that not true sadly  

198
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:29,600
we are so quick to talk about why are people 
getting hacked why are people getting uh robbed  

199
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,320
why are people getting all these things and not 
using password managers and at the same time  

200
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:40,879
when people do get compromised by criminals 
we're like ha ha you should have had this  

201
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,360
or you should have done that or why 
weren't you using that how helpful is that

202
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,159
it's like i don't care if you're a 
doctor that's going to help me out  

203
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:58,960
and save my life it's like it's hard to come and 
approach you for that if you're a bleeding a-hole  

204
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,840
you know it's like it's hard to really 
go and say hey whoa okay can you well  

205
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,840
you shouldn't have done that like i know 
what i shouldn't have done i need help now

206
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,040
and also for uh this is a direct week for 
me that i i did oh well for everyone who  

207
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,879
feels like they are constantly being judged 
and asked to prove that they belong here  

208
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,840
please note i received this just this morning 
in my bms thank you randall i needed the chucko  

209
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,720
uh chuckle and oh and by the way before 
i knew what a computer was i was a hacker  

210
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:40,160
you're born one because his dm message was are 
you actually a hacker and i did that's not his uh  

211
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:45,760
avatar i just covered his name up to protect the 
stupid um but yeah that's exactly what happened  

212
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:51,840
people constantly coming at me and saying that 
i'm not technical enough to call myself a hacker  

213
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:58,000
they say i'm cosplaying as a hacker they're saying 
i'm a scene [ __ ] they're saying i'm just someone  

214
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,040
that's just trying to like you know uh milk it for 
all's worth you should read some of the comments  

215
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,879
and stuff on some of my youtube videos when 
i'm very depressed and i like to punish myself  

216
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,520
i do it's like which is also something i don't 
advise never read the comments on youtube it's  

217
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,320
just never going to well that read it 
it's like it's just a fruitless thing uh  

218
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:23,200
take that advice too uh but no it's like seriously 
it's like i don't need justification from anybody  

219
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:30,800
i'm not looking for your approval if i'm a 
hacker or not to be in your cool kids club  

220
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:36,800
i don't even want to be in your cool kids 
club let's get that start sorted right now  

221
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:44,960
hackers are not about being in their clicks 
they shouldn't be it's about breaking barriers  

222
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:50,960
and you talk about gatekeeping mother i'm a 
hacker i don't even recognize there's a gate  

223
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:58,560
if you're not jumping that fence over the 
gatekeeper what are you doing here at that noise  

224
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:06,240
we do not let barriers stop us you 
see a gatekeeper it's like don't even  

225
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:13,840
acknowledge the gate just go right on 
through and talking about gatekeeping  

226
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:19,199
talking about some of the issues that we 
have there's another big issue that we have  

227
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:30,960
to talk about matrix was great for showing how 
great neo was right remember matrix one wasn't  

228
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:37,280
trinity a freaking and i i i i just have to say 
it straight out wasn't trinity a freaking badass

229
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,000
they were all talking about how you 
can't fight a an agent you can't you know  

230
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,240
you can't uh go for you can't survive and 
interact with an agent who was the very  

231
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:54,800
first person in the very first scene to survive 
an encounter with an agent effing trinity did  

232
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:02,240
she did that mess by second matrix in the 
third she was the love interest for neo

233
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,840
she still had some cool roles but she was 
more considered that than the freaking  

234
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:16,639
badass that she was and that's the problem we 
have sometimes in infosec and in this hacking  

235
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:23,520
community is we want to treat women like this 
instead of trinity no it doesn't work that way  

236
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:30,720
it's like and you think i'm exaggerating these are 
all perfect from the beginning of the year these  

237
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:37,760
are all uh tweets from women from the beginning 
of the year showing how the harassment they get  

238
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:44,879
the harassment they get constantly on a daily 
basis mother let's not go this is the first of  

239
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:53,840
the year this is old news jason right this 
is from yesterday this is from yesterday  

240
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,680
l goes and says why is that uh why is it 
that it's impossible to type correctly on  

241
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:08,160
the command line when someone is watching you uh 
hashtag linux how is that not a tech tweet right  

242
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:15,360
that's a technical tweet that's a funny joke 
tweet right a lot of people liked it 37 different  

243
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,600
replies and i'm like and you're thinking 
it's like yeah that's very funny it's like  

244
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,600
did anybody at once when you're reading 
that tweet go like oh she really wants me

245
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,440
i think she's coming on no

246
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,760
but look at the replies do you see 
something wrong with the replies in this  

247
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,960
oh don't worry don't worry 
let me point it out to you

248
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:44,640
that is a typical response for most women in tech

249
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:55,520
if you don't think they get that daily in 
their replies or worse and they get worse  

250
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:02,240
in their dms then mother you're not talking to 
women in this industry you're not talking to  

251
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:07,200
women in this community and if you're talking 
to them you're definitely not listening to them  

252
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:15,440
that's what we need more of talk about that it's 
like i got this this morning was 11 hours ago but  

253
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:21,280
i got this this morning but women don't tell me 
about this stuff so it must not happen no they're  

254
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:26,879
just not telling you if you work in tech and you 
think bias and discrimination don't exist just  

255
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,600
because they're not affecting you that doesn't 
mean others aren't experiencing it if you're not  

256
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:39,439
hearing about it it's because the people affected 
by it don't think you're a safe ally straight up i  

257
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:47,920
am like i have been amazed at some of the stories 
that i've heard from women it's ghastly it's like  

258
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:57,520
and this whole concept i find ludicrous i find 
amazingly idiotic is the whole phrase that we  

259
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:04,160
use we need we need to get women into tech we 
need to put women in tech we need to get how do  

260
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:11,040
you get women in tech and i keep their scratching 
my head like mother women started this industry  

261
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,280
you're not trying to get women in tech 
you're trying to get women back in tech aydah  

262
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,200
lovelace freaking broke the first programming 
language before there was an effing computer

263
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:32,320
seriously it's like freaking bletchley park oh 
yeah we had alan turing yes he did an amazing  

264
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:37,040
job he was an amazing hacker what about all 
those women mathematicians that were putting in  

265
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:43,760
that work oh we got people on the moon yeah 
mother because of all the people of color  

266
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,960
women who were putting in the work and 
doing the math and working the computers  

267
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,960
oh but we gave them a movie so i guess we're 
good now we're good on that they got a movie  

268
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,600
it's like i think some people got some nominations 
and some awards so we're good no you're trying to  

269
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:05,520
get women back in tech after men drove them out 
and now you got the audacity to look around like  

270
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:13,600
where did all the women go where did all the 
women go it's like if you go to a conference well  

271
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:20,879
if we all ever go back to a conference and 
you look at a woman that's there and you think  

272
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,440
oh i wonder if she's in the sales 
department i wonder if she's marketing  

273
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,760
or if you think i wonder she's here with 
her boyfriend guess what you're an idiot  

274
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:43,040
straight and simple if you say that out loud 
in your outside voice to them you're malicious

275
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,879
you're effing despicable and 
should be ashamed of yourself

276
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:59,360
because every person that is at a hacking 
conference belongs there it's like you don't  

277
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:05,600
ask you don't qualify why they're there they're 
there for the same reason you are they want to  

278
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:11,040
learn and they want to find out things and if 
you're not there for that reason get them out

279
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,960
that's how that works

280
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:24,320
and i'm so tired of rock stars i'm so 
tired of rock stars in this industry  

281
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:29,199
i've had people come up to me and they've 
called me rockstar and they're being 100  

282
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:35,120
sincere and thoughtful and i cringe internally 
every time because i'm not an effing rock star  

283
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:41,040
i don't know how to play the music 
my singing could actually probably  

284
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:46,000
traumatize cats for the rest of their lives 
it's like you don't want to hear me sing  

285
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,280
it's like dancing it's only done it's like in 
private when people can laugh at me one-on-one  

286
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:59,200
it's like that's how bad i am i am not a rock star 
neo was not a rock star neo was neil was the one  

287
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:07,200
mother neal was the one how many times 
did he get saved by all these other people  

288
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,400
how many times did everything get saved because 
of the work of all these other people look in the  

289
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,840
lower left hand corner remember that guys i don't 
remember that guy's name i literally was surprised  

290
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:25,440
when i watched the movie again and realized he 
actually lived spoiler alert i was surprised  

291
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:34,640
he was comedy relief he was neo's sidekick 
he was a fan boy for neo but in epis in uh  

292
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:42,560
the movie two the sequel he saved neo's life 
inadvertently in a funny way he saved neo's life  

293
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:50,240
and the third one it was him bringing the uh 
the ammo to that really angry guy in the middle  

294
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:55,839
who kept the docks open so the ship 
could come in so neo could save everybody  

295
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:05,120
that's what happens there are no rock stars in 
this industry it's all of us doing what we can  

296
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:13,279
to help and educate others if you are out there 
trying to help and make things better guess what  

297
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:20,640
you're better than the one you're better than neo 
you're better than an epping rock star because  

298
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:28,560
you're putting in that work without having to be 
on stage to do it that's what makes it important  

299
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:36,160
that's what makes it count because you're 
putting in that effort without the accolades  

300
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:46,560
one of the hardest effing leadest hackers i know 
teton believe uh i'm not gonna say i'm not gonna  

301
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:51,600
totally dox him because he probably get this off 
at me but my friend felipe uh goes by teton on  

302
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:56,560
twitter it's like he's got like maybe like a 
hundred followers that mother is like one of  

303
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:04,240
the sickest i've seen where he's i've been on 
engagements with him there has never been an  

304
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:10,479
engagement that i have been on oh yeah i walk into 
banks and i break in and i can put in usb drives i  

305
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:16,800
have never gone and engaged with him without him 
getting domain admin within the net the first few  

306
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:26,160
hours every single time domain admin my stuff 
looks really cool my stuff looks great on video  

307
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:34,400
you've seen all my talks what about tee time 
oh that's right he's not tweeting a whole bunch  

308
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:42,240
he's putting in work he's doing the thing 
he's doing research he's coming up with new  

309
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,359
ways to do things it's like he comes up and 
builds things and like and creates things and  

310
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:51,360
i mean i think this guy tap fiber lines 
just to prove it could happen for a bank

311
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,640
that's what he does

312
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:01,440
why is he not a rock star because he's not 
trying to be a rock star he's trying to be a  

313
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:08,400
hacker and he's trying to make things better 
it's like that whole freaking hashtag try  

314
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:20,160
harder mother stop trying harder hashtag do better 
be better that's it i'm not trying harder for you  

315
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,319
i'm not trying harder for anybody in this 
community or to prove anything i'm trying  

316
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:32,880
to do better for me i'm trying to be better for me 
to be better for everyone to help out where i can  

317
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:41,280
recognition or not i'm trying to be better 
as a person as a hacker as a human being  

318
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:50,000
and then i'm trying to do something with that stop 
trying to try harder start doing better and being  

319
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,440
better to everyone in this community even the 
infosec people who don't seem to care about us  

320
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:03,440
and yes i'm very despising but it's been a very 
bad week for me uh on that topic and i don't i  

321
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:10,480
i forgive very easily i forget a 
lot harder so we need to understand  

322
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:18,880
that everyone in this community makes it there 
is no one person in this community that is gone  

323
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:29,600
and like oh i guess we all go home now if i die 
tomorrow this thing goes on this community goes on  

324
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:37,760
because it's made from everybody 
no one person is this community no  

325
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:46,560
one person is the voice of this community no one 
person is what the epitome is no there is no one  

326
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:56,560
there is us and that means the people you disagree 
with that means the people who look different than  

327
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:04,799
you that means the people who believe in things 
different than you people who love different  

328
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:14,400
than you people who vote differently than you 
everyone that's what this community is made up

329
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:22,240
you're looking for someone to say that you're 
a hacker you're looking for someone to say  

330
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:28,000
that you belong you're looking for your 
oracle to tell you what your destiny is  

331
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:42,080
no because when it comes down to it there is 
no spoon there's not there is no one answer  

332
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:51,840
there is no one goal there is just be 
better and do better as humans and hackers  

333
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,800
that's what we need to learn from that no 
one is going to make you the one because you  

334
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:07,920
can't no one's going to make you a hacker 
because you are stop looking for the spoon  

335
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,000
start looking for things that you can make better

336
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:30,720
well uh well fantastic jason um just remember 
there's no spoon but there are some questions  

337
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:38,959
to your to your talk it was amazing um well 
what is your opinion regarding laws and  

338
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,320
regulations that try to define and limit hacker 
activity and try to establish regulated hackers

339
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,839
um

340
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:57,440
uh about people creating laws for hackers uh and 
trying to write um i think there should be laws  

341
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:08,400
for crime it's like uh in uh what should we call 
it in germany they made laws for hacking tools  

342
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:16,160
you can't bring hacking tools and i'm like do 
you know how many of your ibs systems run in map  

343
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:22,720
do you know how many programs in there are uh 
uh and and systems that you're using you snort  

344
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,600
how many freaking how ridiculous that is  

345
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:36,720
it's like so yeah they can try to outlaw this 
stuff but they can't outlaw what they're using  

346
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:43,040
they can't outlaw and this is one of the things 
that i hate about uh certain hackers because  

347
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:48,640
certain hackers they'll be like oh i'm cool i'm 
dark and mysterious i'm gonna put on my hoodie  

348
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,200
and i'm gonna be all like very very dark and 
mysterious i'm gonna be all edgy and stuff on  

349
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:58,720
twitter and i'm gonna talk about how i'm joining 
anonymous and all that stuff you know mother great  

350
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:06,240
because guess what when the normal people see 
that they get effing terrified and when people  

351
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:13,200
are afraid they fight back people are scared of 
the unknown and what they're afraid of they tried  

352
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:19,200
to destroy so congratulations for making it harder 
for actual hackers who are trying to put in work  

353
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:26,560
it's like and trust me that's coming from a guy 
who loves my effing hoodie okay it's like i've got  

354
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:31,440
my lab usually it's like i've got all my hacker 
stuff i got all my i'm looking all like you know  

355
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:40,160
stereotypical hacker because there's nothing wrong 
with that but be willing to educate people as well  

356
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:46,080
when they mistake you for a criminal stop trying 
to think that that makes you cooler it makes you  

357
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:52,480
look like a man i remember one time seriously this 
was 10 years ago over 10 years ago i was in brazil  

358
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,920
it's like in recipe and this guy literally 
said to me at the dinner's like man jason  

359
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,840
it's not as cool enough to be a hacker uh 
here in brazil and he's like why it's like  

360
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:06,560
well because everybody does crime and so it's not 
that edgy or that big of a deal it's like i'm like  

361
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:12,160
are you even kidding me did those words just come 
out of your mouth it's like it's like that's not  

362
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:18,080
what you're supposed to be that's not how that 
works that's not how any of this works so that  

363
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:24,080
doesn't make you edgy it makes you stupid it's 
like as a hacker you should have your hoodie on  

364
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:30,640
but you should be educating people in the public 
you should be talking to other people that have  

365
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:36,080
those misconceptions and explaining when you 
see a bad tv report contact the news station  

366
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:42,000
and say that was a mischaracterization this is 
what this is here's resources there's a website  

367
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,360
ironing.com that i put out there that actually 
shows you where to go to help with the media

368
00:44:49,760 --> 00:45:00,160
okay okay amazing stuff in other countries are 
always uh well something to to learn about yeah  

369
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:06,960
about the way they every place managed stuff but 
in a different way that well yeah my deathcon  

370
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:12,160
22 talk actually talks about different hacking 
cultures all over the world it's like because it's  

371
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:18,399
it depressingly while there's a lot of 
differences there's also a lot of similarities  

372
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:25,600
between how hackers get uh reviled and get 
persecuted by people in those societies yeah  

373
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:38,000
okay um there are some at least two questions more 
okay do you believe governments should develop a  

374
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:46,560
new official and legal army component of hackers 
in order to face the future stable wars oh my gosh  

375
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,400
uh let's put it this way it's like government's 
already got those why we ask them if they should  

376
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:58,160
they got them it's like people talk about uh 
spying and everything like oh your government's  

377
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,319
fine it's like or this government is fine 
i'm like like our like our government isn't  

378
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:06,880
spying i pay my taxes my government better 
be spying that's what we're paying taxes for  

379
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:14,320
i tell people the problem is not the governments 
are spying duh is that they're doing it so poorly  

380
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:20,800
my government sucks at spying it's like freaking 
snowden walked out with all the freaking data and  

381
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:27,200
everybody was so freaking upset about finding out 
about all the things that the nsa was doing like  

382
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:32,720
mother we knew they were doing that why are 
we talking about the real story you buried  

383
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:39,919
the lead the real story was freaking the national 
security agency couldn't even protect their own  

384
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:46,640
data from an insider threat they couldn't look 
i know the government surf uh watching where i  

385
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:52,480
serve okay but my partnership between me and my 
government nobody else they shouldn't be allowed  

386
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,720
people to link that stuff they shouldn't 
i don't want my logs all over the place  

387
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:03,280
right that's between me and my government it's 
like all those nudes i said don't that that those  

388
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:08,640
are private i mean i'm sure a private somewhere 
in an army base somewhere is like looking up  

389
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:13,839
whatever i don't care i hope he likes it but 
everybody else should keep their eyes off of it  

390
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:22,080
so i'm tired of our governments being really 
sloppy at their job it's like that's what  

391
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:26,720
my problem is it's like we all know that the 
governments are doing it it's like people talked  

392
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:32,160
about the elections and like oh governments are uh 
affected uh especially like 2016. we had so much  

393
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,240
government inference whatever you're just jealous 
because they did it better than what you've been  

394
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:42,879
doing in south america and central america for 
the last 30 years like the us hasn't interfered  

395
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:49,360
in elections talk to ask to shove orion how that 
worked out for them it's like this is ridiculous  

396
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:56,320
and it's hypocrisy so yeah no we gotta talk about 
governments it's like in spying it's already done  

397
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:02,320
they're already doing it get over it use 
encryption use signal use tor whatever just do it  

398
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:13,760
good okay there is another another question 
here um what can we do to stimulate in the  

399
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:18,960
right way our young kids to get into 
the computer and hacking world i'll  

400
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:28,400
you stimulate young kids by teaching them that 
hacking is something about discovery not about  

401
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:37,040
compromise show them that building a robot or 
building a program or using python with minecraft  

402
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:43,680
is hacking it's discovery it's learning teach them 
that first teach them the basics of technology  

403
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:48,319
teach them the basis of like founding that 
curiosity and working on that curiosity  

404
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:54,960
that is how you get children into hacking it's 
like by letting them know and understand that  

405
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:02,240
it's not just oh this is how you break into a 
system that's not hacking breaking into a system  

406
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:10,080
is not hacking it's like learning how 
that worked learning how the exploit work  

407
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:17,520
learning how the vulnerability was there for 
that compromise to occur is hacking i agree  

408
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:25,359
i agree with you and denying a service of 
course not if it's not hacking oh my god  

409
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:30,080
is not even like a really good crime 
it's just like really lazy just like  

410
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:38,400
oh let's get a lit candy like we're hackers 
big red button push yeah look mom i'm a hacker  

411
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:50,319
okay um well there is uh the the last uh 
question i guess uh it is made by gabriel  

412
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:57,840
or power by dariel he says what is 
better for hacking biden or trump

413
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:06,640
my gosh um see you're gonna understand you ask me 
any question i'm gonna answer it i did a question  

414
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:11,359
answer period in beijing and i did the same 
answer about the nsa there that i just did here  

415
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:18,960
i don't give them right so it's like i don't 
filter and i don't care if biden is not technology  

416
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:25,279
influential if he doesn't understand it though 
he does we need an epping adult in the room and  

417
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:32,000
when jcd street is saying that we need an adult 
you're in some serious epping trouble people okay  

418
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:40,320
that's that that should say oh i'm looking for 
an adult now okay it's like so we need it it's  

419
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:47,280
not a choice i told people in 2016 i said 
look i'm not saying you're racist because  

420
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:53,840
you voted for by uh vote voted for trump i'm 
just saying all the racists voted for trump  

421
00:50:54,960 --> 00:51:01,360
in 2016 i'm saying and in 2020 i'm saying 
now mother if you vote for trump you're a  

422
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:06,080
racist because you're supporting a racist 
and you're allowing a racist to keep going  

423
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:13,200
it's like make america great again oh my god 
he the only honest statement he said in his  

424
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:17,759
campaign in 2016 was that we were going to be 
tired of winning and sick of winning because  

425
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:27,600
if this is winning please stop i am tired of the 
winning okay i don't think america could handle  

426
