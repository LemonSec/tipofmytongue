hello thank you very much for joining

32
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:26,680
us my name  re is jack daniel's and

33
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,810
I'm going to be talking about some of the

34
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,110
historical security figures and other

35
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:36,040
kinds of stories this is a

36
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,040
live project so I think you see who

37
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,280
should be in the infotec sounders

38
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,250
so we get into this topic and get started

39
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,290
With the stories

40
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:59,010
then the sounders off project

41
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,040
began seven years ago

42
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,730
for tropical and I realized that it was

43
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,519
much more than a presentation so

44
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,769
well, we are going to start seeing these the

45
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:13,140
work of zolder shopping fisac and we provoked

46
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,168
more stories and people who

47
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:18,870
were  more interesting and also how

48
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,820
we got to where we are and it

49
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,430
could also give us some idea of where

50
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,610
we are going

51
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:31,630
we started with the presentation

52
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,760
well but before this these are

53
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,120
very interesting times they are very

54
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,300
challenging times for all of us

55
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,550
so I want to remind you to please

56
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,810
be  take care

57
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,630
and not only have to take care of

58
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,910
yourself but also for

59
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,050
others

60
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:57,319
and also take care of yourself take care  na

61
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:01,340
others and it is that they may be well I

62
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,960
hope the day comes when we can

63
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,440
travel again and that we can meet in

64
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:11,349
person at some point

65
00:05:11,349 --> 00:05:14,750
and with this this is no longer chat style and

66
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,909
we begin with the content of this

67
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:19,819
good presentation  We must

68
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,830
first say that I am an ignorant

69
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,430
person an old person has been doing

70
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,130
this for longer than people

71
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,260
think because I started as a mechanic I

72
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,650
worked on cars and also had an

73
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,180
understanding of an

74
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,390
inventory system and this may who went to

75
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,610
work in  a

76
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,580
computer department with spare parts and through

77
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,940
that point slowly began to work

78
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,190
more and more with computers until I

79
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,530
realized that I could work on

80
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,810
network security and I have been

81
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,900
working for quite some time and it has been

82
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,470
a great journey but I can say  I do not

83
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:06,190
know everything if one of the charms of

84
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,490
working as a team is that with the

85
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:12,940
whole we know they are much more than

86
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,470
separately

87
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,360
so many people  The people working on

88
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,120
this project have been fantastic and we

89
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,380
cannot see at the end of this

90
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,300
presentation but there is so much to learn

91
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,000
and there are also many things they can

92
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,520
do in terms of security this

93
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,990
is something that is also changing

94
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,470
rapidly in a dynamic way.

95
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,780
think about this that no

96
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,590
matter what your musical tastes are

97
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:39,120
you can also spend a little

98
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,120
time on youtube or whatever

99
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,760
music system you like you can

100
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,460
do a little searching and you can

101
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,529
find the story

102
00:06:50,529 --> 00:06:53,709
I am for example I love the  rock and

103
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:58,229
roll and American blues and I see

104
00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:01,809
the different variations of jazz and the

105
00:07:01,809 --> 00:07:06,369
history of the blues and if you look

106
00:07:06,369 --> 00:07:08,709
at this you can also find things

107
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:12,309
that have an influence so that

108
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:15,969
today they were the great singers

109
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:18,549
today of hip  hop and one could was the fer

110
00:07:18,549 --> 00:07:21,129
and there has always been a straight line

111
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:24,819
where people are doing rap and

112
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,119
hip hop and that could give the area

113
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:30,609
inspiration from is  The type of fruit

114
00:07:30,609 --> 00:07:33,099
after where people are doing the

115
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:35,439
rocker could have an inspiration in

116
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:37,809
the case of the cluj but it is not the same

117
00:07:37,809 --> 00:07:40,689
but it is also quite interesting to be

118
00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:44,709
able to delve into that type of thing and

119
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:46,959
if you want some ideas

120
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:50,229
there are some documentaries I like  for

121
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:51,579
example on the guitar the anti k I

122
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:54,579
don't have the talent to play it but I

123
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:55,490
like it

124
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,710
so it is a documentary called the

125
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,030
theme of the work

126
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,979
we work with 110 mph and others and it is

127
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:09,040
fantastic and this can give us an idea

128
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,850
of a story the progression of

129
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,070
music and when we talk about the

130
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:18,240
different types of music for example the

131
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,419
plan camps

132
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:24,720
of funk jazz

133
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,960
and also has a fantastic career and

134
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,470
takes us on a journey through the

135
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,419
history of music

136
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,729
there is a time that I would like to take a

137
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:38,280
song it

138
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,830
must be varied  It was made a

139
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,539
documentary about a song called summer

140
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:45,660
time, that is, whoever likes the

141
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,670
context of regional music

142
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:53,400
could also take this point and that you can

143
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,460
see  different styles of jazz from a

144
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,910
version of janis joplin also these

145
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:04,910
rock people and also him

146
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,370
this has been a fantastic journey with

147
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,460
only one song we can see in the

148
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,190
history of blues it really sounded very

149
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,140
original but also in the genre of

150
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,570
flowers that many people  None of

151
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:21,020
this is esoteric, far from it, but if

152
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,320
you think about it,

153
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,560
let's take some of the things we do

154
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,870
in life because like why we got

155
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:33,160
to this point and then why

156
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,279
should we care about looking back

157
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:40,930
and I like to think that when one takes

158
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,720
this and  he begins to look in the

159
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,089
rear view mirror of the car because things

160
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:49,029
repeat themselves and one wants to know how he got

161
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:52,269
to this point and what he has left behind

162
00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:54,970
so well let's start that there are

163
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,100
different ways of saying it but because

164
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,529
we do not know these stories these

165
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:03,990
people well things will be  different in the

166
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:07,209
past the challenges

167
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:09,639
people's approaches were also

168
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:12,249
different cybersecurity was not a business

169
00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:13,779
but a  part of what

170
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:17,339
people did also a

171
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,420
lot of cryptography also

172
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,750
had to do a lot with encryption and

173
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,050
how it has evolved also more

174
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,600
what I said earlier is that

175
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,390
we keep changing because it is also

176
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,890
difficult to keep up there are

177
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,720
people in our field there are  many

178
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,510
people who are within this field

179
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,540
who have a historical perspective and

180
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,580
I have been in these fields for a long

181
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,230
time also one tries to keep up

182
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,980
to date and many times you can not you

183
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,670


184
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:53,150
can not go back then I have also

185
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,250
had the time to  start this

186
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,730
project so I can share

187
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,950
some of these points we have had

188
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:04,390
quite a hard work not even

189
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:08,750
404 because 404 was before the internet

190
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,480
before the web if one can have

191
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,340
any reference in wikipedia it is

192
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,140
difficult to find some cases

193
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:18,520
literally does not exist so

194
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,290
we have also lost quite a bit of this

195
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,690
history

196
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:27,160
much of the work that has been done in

197
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,930
isolation or with different  n many

198
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:33,860
organizations military things that are

199
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,730
done in secret or encrypted and also it

200
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,950
is not always public and many times it never

201
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,740
comes to light so it

202
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,650
does not matter if you are a secret and many

203
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,600
times it is not easy to find the things

204
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,990
that are done in higher education

205
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:54,260
We can also see in the world of

206
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:58,370
infosec so we have these groups

207
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:02,060
as we have had different types of

208
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,160
audiences we have also had

209
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,620
problems in accepting ourselves there are many

210
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,870
people who are much more practical and

211
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:12,880
the environment of infosec and people with more

212
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,070
education and also who are not

213
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,190
contributing  to the issues of the newspaper

214
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:22,070
but the challenges are that we must also

215
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,800
work together and we must also

216
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,050
get to see all that work that is

217
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,220
being done

218
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,110
there are many of these people have

219
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:33,500
died other movements have a

220
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,600
management role and many times we

221
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,230
do not do what we do  are still active are

222
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,330
many times we do not see each other or they are not in

223
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,970
the same conference circuit and

224
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:47,270
also in the circuit of  the different

225
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,550
educational systems or the

226
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:52,310
limits that may have a certain

227
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:55,070
untrust not good that is in terms of

228
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,230
the phase but let's focus on this

229
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,780
because now one knows the names but

230
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,819
we know the people

231
00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:05,819
well for example let's look at the touring

232
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:08,609
because I'm kidding  Of course, he is the one

233
00:13:08,609 --> 00:13:13,580
who plays Alan Turing

234
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:17,230
and tells you how to do certain excesses

235
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:21,980
in this film, but if he gives us a

236
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,830
unit, this really is Alan Turing and

237
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,900
he is known for inventing the

238
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,960
computer. He has a

239
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,250
brilliant story. His life story is also quite

240
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,920
tragic.  we know but he is a

241
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,900
brilliant and good guy this man is also

242
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,460
unknown but they probably have not

243
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,740
heard much they left top has that he

244
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,790
was an engineer and he did the

245
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:51,970
engineering design to be able to build the

246
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:56,660
machine that was taken was based on the ideas

247
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,840
of sawdust and the  turned into some plans

248
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,120
so that someone can build something and

249
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,980
supervise them then also other

250
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,700
people also started  joining things

251
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:11,090
they began to assemble putting bolts and

252
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:14,150
nuts then this ring

253
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,970
also had part of the credit but this

254
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,740
to remind them that many other

255
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,020
people also had to do a

256
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,290
hard work also who we do not

257
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,890
remember many times they come out short

258
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:30,440
welland where they also started working

259
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,660
with churri  and she said that there were also

260
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:38,240
quite a few people who were breaking

261
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,360
the codes to be able to do these

262
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,210
jobs and there were also some

263
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:47,240
women who worked to be able to

264
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,030
decipher these codes and they also

265
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,640
gave us some samples to be able to

266
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,620
accelerate these codes the power is to

267
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,900
break these codes and we also had

268
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,590
cryptography and this could give us an

269
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:06,680
idea of the plaintext to be able to speed up

270
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,920
and be able to

271
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,200
break these codes so it's good

272
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,000
in terms of us we don't always

273
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,600
get the glory and we're

274
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,070
making this world a much

275
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,889
safer place saying this

276
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:23,410
there are a lot of people probably

277
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:26,679
have never heard of third parties ye

278
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:29,319
I know that I resist that someone is here those

279
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:34,960
who and the good thing these people

280
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,020
who could build the computer

281
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,360
to be able to enter the

282
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:45,280
enigma code and used their skills to be

283
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,209
able to

284
00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:49,910
if they were the first stigma codes

285
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:53,509
this is an image of the yes sheet with

286
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:57,999
cesc  and where they realized to be able to

287
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:01,100
concentrate on this code in these

288
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,660
sheets and that they were forced to enigma

289
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,600
was to evolve and some more

290
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,839
modern things that we have finally heard

291
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,679
the name of fixing in and we have here

292
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:18,439
this exchange of keys of difficulty

293
00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:22,220
that are these keys  that dictated graphics

294
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,379
in the safety nets to be able to

295
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:26,720
make sure of new directions in

296
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,990
typography that were published in the year

297
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,589
76 and also that they are doing the

298
00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:37,809
distribution of these keys

299
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,959
the article also talks about the

300
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,660
development with the different types of

301
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:48,140
egypt writing and that  we have also

302
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,440
seen it for a long time to be able to see

303
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,769
the privacy factors and emphasized

304
00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:57,290
interested the security  physicality because

305
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:00,230
he was also working on a

306
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:03,440
movement and these people can

307
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,839
see that nobody is there two laps

308
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,809
although conferences in san francisco

309
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:14,279
but they have listened to temples marco is

310
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:18,339
good brown's work as a

311
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:24,459
computational scientist also invented the

312
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:27,819
case of cryptography molecular technology

313
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:30,049


314
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:34,149
Sealing would also officiate its work is

315
00:17:34,149 --> 00:17:36,550
foundational, it

316
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:39,100
is the way in which we secure

317
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,470
the internet and other people that you

318
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,370
might know know their names

319
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:49,020
if we go to this point here

320
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,880
rsa one think it is a company

321
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,850
today but there are three people reverse

322
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,870
merida  blue man

323
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:02,720
and they are 72 evils, I am real people, they have made

324
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,030
different investments and have published

325
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,640
voting systems that are

326
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,550
relieved in cryptography and

327
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,770
democracy, which is also very important

328
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:19,130
and it is part of the public domain in the

329
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,100
area and it is also part of

330
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,470
cryptanalysis.  foundational escate spelling

331
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:28,460
also to hernán is

332
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,160
using the biological components  The

333
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,710
real object and they are still

334
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:37,140
there around, we have seen it in

335
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,480
different conferences, they are real people,

336
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,880
it is not only people that once was

337
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,650
a company, we talk about secret security

338
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:47,950


339
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:51,130
and much more and that is why they did what

340
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,250
they did

341
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,260
because again someone  you

342
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,840
probably don't know

343
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:03,590
james ellis eight seventies

344
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:06,320
while he was on the site in

345
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,279
britain he

346
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,590
wrote a paper describing what he

347
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:13,870
called non-secret encryption in the 70s

348
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:17,720
some years later it would become known as

349
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,299
a public key encryption

350
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:26,869
we have another younger gentleman gifford  cox

351
00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:30,109
who joined this organization in 73 and

352
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:31,519
one of the first things that happened

353
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:35,210
was that he was given the paper and they

354
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:37,369
asked him ok what do you think is good if there are

355
00:19:37,369 --> 00:19:39,710
things that I share but there is a

356
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:42,409
critical algorithm that later became known

357
00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:44,960
as rsa

358
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,450
later he invented

359
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,580
identity-based encryption and other

360
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,690
activities carried out in the same organization

361
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,300
also by

362
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,190
a colleague from the

363
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,770
clifford university that was in the field edition

364
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:02,520
that joined the 17th and later and

365
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,590
the pp was also given to him pretends that

366
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:09,030
not that he thought and in the year 74 he designed a

367
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:11,760
way to exchange

368
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,140
encryption keys in a network in a network

369
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,630
in which  it is not trusted and this was

370
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:20,419
published later

371
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,330
and none of this was known or at least

372
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,799
not known to most

373
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,899
people until 97 when this was

374
00:20:26,899 --> 00:20:29,809
declassified so this is a

375
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:31,789
classic case of the things we do not know and it is

376
00:20:31,789 --> 00:20:34,970
interesting that someone  has thought about

377
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,830
all this someone had thought about the

378
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:40,169
key components of rsa

379
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:44,119
a few years before

380
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,380
and also a key point of people

381
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,049
thought about this independently

382
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,660
but also even though they did

383
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:57,620
what happened in 17 first which was that it was not

384
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,690
used in a way  popular the absolute is almost not

385
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,580
used and with certainty for

386
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,860
the public it was not available so it

387
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,130
did not change the world or anything like

388
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:10,730
that what rsa children did was that it

389
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,020
really changed how fun  ciona on the internet

390
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,480
training security and privacy for

391
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,580
many decades in the future so it will be

392
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,650
the first does not necessarily mean

393
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,450
that we are going to do who has the greatest

394
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:22,400
impact so these are the people

395
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,590
who have great stories and we are going

396
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:28,360
to see ten more stories

397
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,500
there are some that maybe  They have already heard

398
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,700
and some have not, so we must

399
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,370
start with because we are concerned about

400
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,620
ensuring things, what is the challenge

401
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,410
that exists because there are people who

402
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:42,540
want to use what we are doing

403
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,400
and who want to use information for

404
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,720
their own benefit or misuse it

405
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,990
and this is a  image of a

406
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:54,710
traffic light tower or rather a French replica

407
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:59,120
and in the 1700s beginning 1800 the

408
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,250
French government built these towers throughout

409
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,809
the country and used them to send

410
00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:05,780
signals for the government thread

411
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:09,460
only throughout the entire country

412
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,880
françois and the whites realized

413
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,760
that for a small bribe someone

414
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,490
can change a message through

415
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,440
this cable or through this system of

416
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,350
signals and this would be

417
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:27,830
sent throughout the country.

418
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:30,020


419
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,180


420
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,290


421
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:38,230


422
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,540


423
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,910
What they did

424
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:45,100
turned out not to be good for them to include

425
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,789
you have an end

426
00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:50,879
with news of a battle for example

427
00:22:50,879 --> 00:22:54,149
or of goods that came from one of the

428
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:57,909
points of the territory and they could then

429
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:00,700
information that would help them to have

430
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,059
benefits in the financial market

431
00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:07,820
with the air if  you know how he gave it it

432
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,610
was not encrypted not encrypted

433
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:13,090
therefore you needed

434
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:15,880
this bernard someone else if I have

435
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,000
earned it until they cuvillo they

436
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,840
arrested him and the most recent agent it was

437
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,280
learned that there really was no

438
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,870
free flu against the manipulation

439
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,880
of the  cycle because these people

440
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,880
could not be convicted of a click

441
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,190
if they left france very

442
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:33,910
wisely

443
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,620
the released ones but people have tried to

444
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,990
use or  misusing the networks is

445
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,880
something that has happened forever it is

446
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,510
nothing new

447
00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:46,690
we see the cleaner level of the

448
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:49,179
victorian era magician inventor and hacker a

449
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:51,490
hacker because he was a magician on

450
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:56,350
stage and he invented different things that

451
00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:00,369
he probably wanted to be known

452
00:24:00,369 --> 00:24:03,309
as touring  instead of being known as

453
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:06,050
the person who invented the

454
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:09,200
pay toilet and

455
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,980
is here because he was demonstrating

456
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:16,250
what he called his secured and

457
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:20,710
wireless system and was in a location

458
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:24,519
sending secure messages

459
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:28,659
wirelessly at an age when

460
00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:30,909
he was in london for

461
00:24:30,909 --> 00:24:35,889
show it in reverse investors and

462
00:24:35,889 --> 00:24:38,609
more cream

463
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,880
was the person who sent a

464
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,440
message wirelessly and sent a message

465
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,809
that was advanced, it does not have

466
00:24:45,809 --> 00:24:48,630
markonese therefore finally the message that

467
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,880
was received was online instead of the message

468
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,820
of marconi of the message

469
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:58,149
was a joke  he was making fun of marconi

470
00:24:58,149 --> 00:24:59,799
so basically it didn't work out very well

471
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:03,100
I don't know if it's activism or basically

472
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,309
giving him a hard time  but he was the

473
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:10,320
person who carried out the attack in 1903

474
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,970
so the people doing these

475
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,769
things are nothing new the truth

476
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,170
when we hear from carmel there are people

477
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:21,360
who talk about happiness

478
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,160


479
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,560
and he was a

480
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,120
computer expert between the second

481
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,650
world war  and the work of the

482
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:31,049
census office of france

483
00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:34,080
and when france fell in apparently he

484
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,440
was cooperating with the son-in-law and what

485
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,259
really did change the census to

486
00:25:40,259 --> 00:25:42,179
hide people and we do not know how

487
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:44,999
many people but it is safe to say that

488
00:25:44,999 --> 00:25:47,369
we are talking about thousands of people and

489
00:25:47,369 --> 00:25:52,049
well he was discovered and he was killed

490
00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:53,820
and when we talk about

491
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,679
hacker skills we are talking about people who

492
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,929
have done this for years saving

493
00:25:57,929 --> 00:25:58,950
people's lives unfortunately

494
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:01,110
he did not end very well but he saved

495
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,799
thousands of people

496
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:08,769
and the sacrifice was certainly appreciated

497
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:15,690
we have the lsb fridman which is an

498
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:19,280
interesting story also hers

499
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,940
in the us there was a period in which

500
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,940
there was a prohibition  tion of selling

501
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,420
alcohol

502
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,740
and before

503
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,929
wwii fritz man was working with the

504
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:34,700
united states coast guard

505
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:38,520
to decrypt and intercept

506
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:42,060
the encrypted messages that

507
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:45,450
smugglers were using and those skills

508
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:49,920
put her on the front lines in all the

509
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,230
world's attention  And inside they had

510
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:54,600
several coast guard teams that

511
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,980
she led during the Second

512
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,580
World War and those skills went from

513
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,770
one thing that I do not like at all, which

514
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,450
would be the interruption of the supply of

515
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:06,630
rum, against a different activity that

516
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,640
had nothing to do with rum.  and

517
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,590
of course she was helping to enforce the

518
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,240
road at that time but finally her

519
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,090
skills began to be used in

520
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:18,600
the war and she did not remain active

521
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,190
throughout the entire war and vice

522
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:22,290
inhabits a huge team but it started with

523
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:24,900
only one person who was her  and another

524
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,060
person whose story is not told

525
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,500
much

526
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,900
and here we have an interesting one for

527
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,150
different reasons

528
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:36,060
fernando and corbatón  recently he

529
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,530
just died but I was the first

530
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:40,410
person to lose a password but

531
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,600
very authentic demanding but that was at the

532
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,360
beginning of network computing

533
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,970
and it was safe because we had not

534
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:49,680
yet invented the questioned notes

535
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,310
well with importance the things that are

536
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,500
said in the auditoriums  They are not

537
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,560
exaggerated his work is something that

538
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,900
transformed computers as

539
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,640
we know them today from PCs to

540
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,350
smartphones and to the digital revolution that

541
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:07,720
can really

542
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,480
go back to what he did on the

543
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,870
mighty 60 years ago and in a very

544
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:16,600
important way in  Later years he knew

545
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,000
very well that we had stopped

546
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,590
our passwords that the passwords

547
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:23,530
were a legal risk and instead of being a

548
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:26,559
secure feature it was a risk

549
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,700
and he knew it, he recognized it and the video more

550
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,039
sign in his invention and unfortunately

551
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,539
we still use passwords a

552
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:37,390
lot and another gentleman who is not well

553
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,340
known unless you follow the

554
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:42,610
hacker stories is  better known

555
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,440
by people in the world where

556
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,690
hacker who as someone who helps

557
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,600
ah

558
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:55,610
when working in this area in to work

559
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:58,160
a counter in los alamos at the university

560
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,840
of california in san diego

561
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,539
among other organizations has

562
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:06,570
certified before the congress on

563
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,250
security issues  cell phones and that

564
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:12,890
was in 1992 I will repeat this

565
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,760
how he

566
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,440
rectified before the US Congress

567
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,850
regarding the privacy problems

568
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,710
of cell phones

569
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:24,500
in 1992 many years ago he saw it

570
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:29,120
coming and in 95 it is an important case

571
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,350
if the leader of

572
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:36,060
different projects with mine focal

573
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,550
is an interesting way in fact his

574
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,620
father

575
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,980
won the nobel prize in 2008 in

576
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,670
chemistry

577
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:48,190
in case you did not know and we have another

578
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:51,970
person who mentions that they see next that I have

579
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,610
met people often talk

580
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,690
about  Of

581
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:59,980
the people who can become better people or not, we

582
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,820


583
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:04,520
reform the streets, no, and well,

584
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,590
we have Robert here, not them and I wish the

585
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,660
person knew more about the

586
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,610
history.  a from robert and maurice

587
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:14,429
because you are the person for whom in

588
00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:18,510
the us we have a type of response to

589
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:23,030
computer incidents because he

590
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:26,530
was the first person and it was the first

591
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:29,560
reason why we have a cert

592
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,870
which pushed people to

593
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,550
realize  that we needed a way to

594
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,410
respond we needed a staff

595
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:37,610
we needed

596
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:41,510
the resources and

597
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,130
of course he took the

598
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:46,400
necessary actions and well sir morris for your

599
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,290
access what he should not have and he was the

600
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:50,210
first person that was content that

601
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:53,300
was condemned by the law in the

602
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,500
us  In 1989

603
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:00,840
and he was free for three years and

604
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,150
surely there are people who know him

605
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:06,390
and know what he has done in the deep,

606
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:09,270
two different companies the same for

607
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:12,480
miners is a company that continues to

608
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,630
help incubate new

609
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:19,620
technology companies and has a very long impact

610
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,120
a huge impact and people do not

611
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,909
realize it and everyone impacted that video and

612
00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:26,559
thanks to robert morris

613
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,480
but one thing that seems to me is

614
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,419
more  It is important that he joined

615
00:31:31,419 --> 00:31:35,740
the imade chips school and in fact

616
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,590
has been a professor in computer

617
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,480
science and electrical engineering

618
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,730
since 2006 therefore he did with a

619
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:44,500
mistake did not have bad intentions

620
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,620
merida unfortunately people

621
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,480
only know him  for him

622
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,240
maurice world but now he has

623
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,590
found many more things in

624
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:56,350
technology and has gone to the world of

625
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,480
education to educate hundreds of

626
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,250
generations of electrical engineers,

627
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:03,730
engineers and computer experts and

628
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:06,280
I the truth is that I am not good at

629
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,540
making predictions  I am not a

630
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,940
constant futurist, so I make a

631
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:12,070
prediction, it will be wrong,

632
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:14,860
however, there are some people, it is something

633
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,720
more visionary than me, in fact, much more

634
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,870
visionary is that I the computer will

635
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:22,600
touch men and women

636
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,059
everywhere in everything  moment almost minute by

637
00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:27,370
minute all people will

638
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:29,950
communicate through a computer and this will

639
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,260
change and reshape lives

640
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,860
modify careers and obli  let us adopt them

641
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,350
adapt to a life of continuous change

642
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:40,410
and there are people that we know who

643
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:44,260
would not believe that today

644
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,930
and those people are wrong because it

645
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:49,990
is absolutely real but willi weber

646
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:52,000
made that

647
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,210
statement in 66 the analysis or

648
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:57,280
where the computers were going  He thought about the

649
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,230
potential of the

650
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:02,950
potential connections that would change many

651
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:05,130
things

652
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,760
and work during the Second

653
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,160
World War also in

654
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,190
simon cox class radar systems and he was incorporated

655
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:15,290
for many decades to that work and in

656
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:19,060
the us we have the weather report

657
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:23,300
sport twitter that  It started in the year 67 it

658
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,300
ended in the year 71 which has a

659
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:31,640
fundamental value and is not really appreciated in

660
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,950
it valid status for the last 50

661
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:36,020
years and some of the terminology may

662
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:39,140
be somewhat obsolete but the

663
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,640
general panorama of what is needed to

664
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,320
ensure a system  Operational and

665
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,880
basic security ideas and attacks

666
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,070
are things that are still valid and it is

667
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:50,230
very interesting and was desc  alified

668
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:53,500
in '74 or '75, so if you are

669
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,000
interested in the history of things, it would be

670
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,850
interesting to analyze this report.The

671
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:59,500
image is that they are absolutely

672
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,330
obsolete unless we change

673
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:05,140
some names and perhaps some photos,

674
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,450
but outside of that it is something remarkable.

675
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:10,060
person who through the

676
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,639
computer

677
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:14,889
understood the implications for

678
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:16,449
privacy and he thought that we should have

679
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:18,070
regulations to protect us from this

680
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:20,030
also

681
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:23,129
has a taste of bots

682
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:25,589
is a really impressive gentleman

683
00:34:25,589 --> 00:34:26,819
work that the us national security agency

684
00:34:26,819 --> 00:34:28,829
and created the first

685
00:34:28,829 --> 00:34:33,559
red team  to test secure systems

686
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:37,969
nnsa and other government agencies

687
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:40,190
and he later made

688
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:44,750
private consultancies and probably the first

689
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,030
independent security consultant and

690
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:49,659
miner

691
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:55,139
in the study Rizos de el 71 76 which

692
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:57,480
finally helped to understand problems

693
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,480
that were uploading operating systems and tried to

694
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,880
help  understand the limit of effort

695
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,680
required to improve the safety of the

696
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,970


697
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:09,760
The interesting thing is that he

698
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,010
thought about different points to which he would

699
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,960
upload equipment,

700
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:18,520
for example to different

701
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,170
conditions or parameters, they were

702
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:22,330
inconsistent with respect to the

703
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:25,150
authentic identification

704
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:28,480
etc. and so on and the script was

705
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,470
entitled to have the first

706
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:34,810
privacy and confidentiality policy of the

707
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:39,770
health and in fact we believe the 1st

708
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:44,190
east to pass from the operations more

709
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:47,070
star wars mini classic reservations

710
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,540
for people who are interested in the

711
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,580
films of actors in the film than

712
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:53,070
if not more micros which he was the

713
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,990
technical consultant for most of the

714
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:57,150
roles  time for platforms the

715
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,460
final red team of the energy of the

716
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,250
personalities included and if you

717
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,890
remember the movie at the end a

718
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:07,460
character

719
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:12,950
speaks from voice to voice but not really

720
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,930
that is another historical figure that not

721
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:17,730
many people know and also a

722
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:21,320
friend a good friend

723
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:25,030
This person seems to be a

724
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:27,900
very kind person and another person as follows

725
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,750
because I really like his  history

726
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:34,350
he graduated from university

727
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,750
he went to a center here in the

728
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:42,630
united states and was then assigned the topic

729
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:45,960
of computer security he

730
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,270
said no I don't want to do it but he took

731
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,730
the job and said the west until

732
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:53,820
the person arrives  correct and has spent

733
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:57,150
many decades of jensen then

734
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,500
working in security and changing

735
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:02,130
things and in fact I had microsoft and he was

736
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:04,110
one of the people who was responsible

737
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:06,690
for the trust program

738
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:09,960
microsoft computers and they are things

739
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,130
that he did

740
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:17,900
had a life expectancy quite a bit

741
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,350
useful

742
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:27,230
the usa existed what itself the

743
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:30,619
series of rainbows that were delivered

744
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:32,450
by the government to train you could

745
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,619
jump to all kinds of

746
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:35,930
computer systems and the orange book was

747
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:38,690
essential when it comes to securing

748
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:41,030
government and military systems and

749
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,859
have been adapted  in different

750
00:37:42,859 --> 00:37:44,540
currencies around the world

751
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,550
that was the beginning of the seventies and

752
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,530
continuously updated transit

753
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:51,170
and neil was one of the people  which was

754
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:54,800
a summit in the foundation and key author

755
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,500
on the Naranjo book and 2015

756
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,200
the birth and death

757
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,890
and it is really worth reading this

758
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,720
quote must be interesting for you

759
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,910
if you ask for that knowledge

760
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,849
and the aim of the Naranjo book was to

761
00:38:10,849 --> 00:38:12,799
create a supply in  high

762
00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:14,869
security systems and incorporating

763
00:38:14,869 --> 00:38:16,970
mandatory security controls benefits

764
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:19,220
finding the results because they

765
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:22,160
were all a failure people who are

766
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,190
interested in the story get angry

767
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:27,559
all this with government officials in

768
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:30,460
closed door meetings

769
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,880
well they began to investigate and what

770
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,529
he did was  talk about where it

771
00:38:34,529 --> 00:38:36,269
worked and where it did not work with

772
00:38:36,269 --> 00:38:38,579
certainty if the orange book had

773
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:41,130
success points with certainty but there were certain

774
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:42,839
assumptions that had

775
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:44,579
failed there were certain assumptions that did not exist

776
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:46,799
in reality and that seems to me perhaps something

777
00:38:46,799 --> 00:38:48,420
critical is something we want to do

778
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,249
otherwise we will continue to make

779
00:38:50,249 --> 00:38:52,979
the same mistakes and we must also

780
00:38:52,979 --> 00:38:54,509
consider that e  s minimum years we

781
00:38:54,509 --> 00:38:56,339
interviewed him

782
00:38:56,339 --> 00:38:58,859
on the weekly security podcast and it

783
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:02,460
was a very good conversation, very good

784
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:06,950
so we have been talking about

785
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:12,609
good I am talking about that we are

786
00:39:12,609 --> 00:39:14,710
on the shoulders of giants I want to

787
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:19,210
do here rephrase this sentence I know

788
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:22,030
one that probably would have seen a

789
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:24,430
lot  further away they are far apart on

790
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:28,690
the shoulders of giants and I think this

791
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:33,420
is one of the most incredible scientific minds

792
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,440
in all of our history and to

793
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,010
think about what he did in the world

794
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:42,310
that came after I think it is key for

795
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:44,800
us to understand how the

796
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,330


797
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:52,290


798
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,849
Well, I have been working on this for more than a decade and well, he is one of the projects

799
00:39:57,849 --> 00:39:59,950
that I am working on beyond

800
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:04,270
the support he receives from the people who

801
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:07,690
employ me in saná book and with this I

802
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:09,339
connect that people  and share

803
00:40:09,339 --> 00:40:13,480
ideas so it is worth mentioning that

804
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,800
your version is that we have a project

805
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,800
I want to focus on the shoulders more

806
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,050
than the giants we can not  s to speak

807
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:25,180
of simply the giant because we

808
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:28,569
also need to have the shoulders of

809
00:40:28,569 --> 00:40:32,859
those who need them and I believe

810
00:40:32,859 --> 00:40:35,680
and that the way in which people

811
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,559
become giants is the best

812
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:41,680
way because with this we are

813
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,099
working and being able to advance

814
00:40:45,099 --> 00:40:48,759
provide a man with a back.

815
00:40:48,759 --> 00:40:53,160
makes giants and that is me being

816
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:59,160
idealistic adding reference

817
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:05,940
and well this is a story stories

818
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,550
of hackers and there are many other

819
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:11,060
stories

820
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:15,230
and so well

821
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:19,340
this is the least focused on the US and

822
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,170
there are also people who should be

823
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:23,840
there if they can give it a spin and  Well,

824
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,220
I also want to thank some

825
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:29,560
people, unfortunately I can't

826
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,030
thank Beijing, you see in person

827
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:34,100
because unfortunately the

828
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,330
great face-to-face goal passed away because he is a

829
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:40,880
roadrunner brand of mine too and that has a

830
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,060
lot to do with work there is a

831
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,280
page there is a part in the  page gives

832
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,150
in again first of antivirus and also

833
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:52,070
of the security web applications

834
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:56,450
and in that section  ion there are also quite a few

835
00:41:56,450 --> 00:42:00,500
conversations with robert hansen from ares

836
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:04,220
maker and i would also like to

837
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:08,240
thank doctor ginés for

838
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,760
fritz and he could not have done it without his

839
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,850
guideline without his key usage without his

840
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:16,550
corrections so many thanks

841
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:19,780
to all of them

congratulations for your talk

861
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,570
really discuss a lot the project you

862
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:42,390
have shown  Do that two or three trades

863
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:45,740
we already have some questions

00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:30,500

jacobo dicenta father

877
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,750
then think about how you can

878
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:48,549
represent hackers well it is a

879
00:44:48,549 --> 00:44:51,460
challenge because hollywood is

880
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,440
entertainment is supposed to be

881
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,890
fun and sometimes what we see is

882
00:44:56,890 --> 00:45:00,099
fun and we want to understand that she

883
00:45:00,099 --> 00:45:05,079
is doing something that is not disease

884
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:08,529
and  when people also believe that what

885
00:45:08,529 --> 00:45:10,960
they see on the screen is real sometimes they are

886
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,700
some good ones and I like the movie

887
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:17,559
sneakers also a person who was a

888
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:20,349
consultant for that movie but everything

889
00:45:20,349 --> 00:45:25,079
that happens there is based on reality

890
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:29,960
is not and I don't think I had  what to do with him

891
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,560
with these real people and also the

892
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:37,550
team of nds ah and also films that

893
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:39,440
you for example those of alan cherry will be

894
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,260
taken  of some freedoms there were

895
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:45,220
certain fantasies to be able to make

896
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:48,320
one in a person closer

897
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,020
to the general public those things I

898
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:54,680
like that hackers are all

899
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,020
criminals is something with which I feel

900
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:00,560
very frustrated the term hacker

901
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,440
has also been lost a lot in terms

902
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,210
because  it looks like a definition of

903
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:08,890
criminal to me that I don't like and there

904
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:12,050
are also people who many times in vitals

905
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:13,970
and things like that make no sense

906
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:19,010
finally so alan turing really

907
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:22,880
in the truck also people

908
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,190
were arguing about what a

909
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:30,250
hacker is  ethical and

910
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:33,460
also that is also quite ethical because that

911
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:37,180
is more it is no longer being a

912
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:40,180
hacker activist and well also the first

913
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:43,169
criminals

914
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,940
good

915
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:50,790
and also this tells us that many times it

916
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:54,849
was illegal and also because it was included

917
00:46:54,849 --> 00:46:56,790
when providing chat

918
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:58,420
[Music]

919
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,880
and also  the work that is being

920
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:05,119
done again in sa

921
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:07,009
when they told that they had arrested

922
00:47:07,009 --> 00:47:08,869
their son but what after he did in

923
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:12,710
the university t  He has also worked in a

924
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:16,609
field and was also a mentor to hundreds of

925
00:47:16,609 --> 00:47:19,309
students and the next generation

926
00:47:19,309 --> 00:47:23,380
, therefore we must concentrate

927
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,930
we must concentrate on the

928
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:31,140
good things and hopefully people do not

929
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,930
see it so real because what is seen

930
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:36,240
on the screen is not  The same thing that we see for

931
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,730
example politics many times I get

932
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:41,250
frustrated but I focus on the

933
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:44,120
good things the next question is very

934
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:46,660
difficult for

935
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:49,330
a second I want to ask the next

936
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:52,540
question if we were

937
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:54,460
chatting together that is why he knows what

938
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:57,580
the next question is  but I must formulate

939
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:58,799
the

940
00:47:58,799 --> 00:48:04,069
until they already sought to teach

941
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:10,760
camps to be house peanut ferment

942
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:14,930
reject white face cold any

943
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:17,120
peaks now or not have

944
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:20,680
jack kate white

945
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:24,500
one way

946
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:27,710
the judgment transfer me from being already his

947
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:30,410
tree of pipo of all the people who

948
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:34,670
mentioned which  Do you think it is the most

949
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:37,550
important thing that has been the most important?

950
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:40,580
Well that is something very difficult It is very

951
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:42,900
complex

952
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:45,750
because we all have to work

953
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:48,000
together  It must be on our part

954
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,400
because for example in the case of the ring

955
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,690
it is also a fantastic job it

956
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:56,820
had to be a team effort and one

957
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:59,559
could always return

958
00:48:59,559 --> 00:49:01,719
some habits because it was also

959
00:49:01,719 --> 00:49:03,060
fantastic

960
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:04,240
[Music]

961
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,670
because he was also one of the first

962
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:09,850
security consultants to  the first

963
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:11,740
person who stood out as part of his

964
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:15,340
job and also in his work with the

965
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:19,200
government and I also think it was quite

966
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,390
significant and something modern for this

967
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:24,200
world

968
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,660
there are others

969
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,490
and I think we can also see it in

970
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:31,650
terms of wiki there are also some more

971
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:33,500
buildings

972
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:37,780
we have  There are also people who are very

973
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:43,130
less known but it is impossible to choose

974
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:47,000
just one but perhaps because of the

975
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,210
diversity of what was done and

976
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:53,510
also that it was quite profound for the

977
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:56,090
industry, even that many people

978
00:49:56,090 --> 00:49:59,000
do not recognize what is covered more

979
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,330
jac

980
00:50:01,829 --> 00:50:05,309
we have a  couple of other questions if i

981
00:50:05,309 --> 00:50:09,499
may i would also like to discuss

982
00:50:09,499 --> 00:50:14,309
the profile questions so she

983
00:50:14,309 --> 00:50:16,849
asked

984
00:50:16,849 --> 00:50:19,489
there are not many women  in your presentation

985
00:50:19,489 --> 00:50:22,130
but you think that could be

986
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:26,529
changed the next question sphere and

987
00:50:26,529 --> 00:50:30,220
hammer height

988
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:41,349
well there are many women

989
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:45,220
there are also some women who should

990
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:48,790
be here but this is not an

991
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:51,790
8 hour class but hey people

992
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:54,029
like

993
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:57,660
pickets because too  one of the

994
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:00,410
great challenges

995
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:03,369
one of the great injustices in the

996
00:51:03,369 --> 00:51:07,000
history of computing is that many

997
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,490
of the questions are foundational and the

998
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:11,800
foundational work was done by

999
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:17,790
women s has also been treated as

1000
00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:20,430
secretaries like price heartbreak wants

1001
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:22,900
and I put the first compiler because it

1002
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:25,690
started  To program that they used these

1003
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:29,460
kart cables and

1004
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:32,620
well, it

1005
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:38,060
is also when we can do this

1006
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:40,580
professional work and when we say

1007
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:44,410
what could be done with charlin

1008
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:49,690
and also the touring codes could not be broken

1009
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:54,830
and we also had a

1010
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:56,930
different group of architects here so

1011
00:51:56,930 --> 00:52:01,730
also this was also to have an idea

1012
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:05,110
of these texts plans to start also

1013
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:08,300
I hope there is a lot  more because

1014
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:11,090
we have also done some work in

1015
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:13,160
older generations there were also

1016
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:17,250
more women and then

1017
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:21,230
we had

1018
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:24,260
diversity diversity is needed for many

1019
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:26,510
reasons so this is also a way

1020
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:29,150
of telling you that I really hope

1021
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:32,260
that future generations

1022
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:39,530
and also these will be a lot  more diverse

1023
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:45,720
I can look for love and

1024
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:48,809
stubborn issues allows me to see if they are

1025
00:52:48,809 --> 00:52:53,789
very useful adjustments a peak of people like

1026
00:52:53,789 --> 00:52:58,369
the slackers rule out writing

1027
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:04,460
without listening to music part of the new

1028
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:09,070
generation soft critically leaves

1029
00:53:10,789 --> 00:53:13,849
the truth or looking for love which

1030
00:53:13,849 --> 00:53:18,980
would be the  Combinative cupreder and /

1031
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:21,560
or pains of the new generations of

1032
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:25,390
the communities compared to the

1033
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:27,590
previous communities of the 8 all

1034
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:30,310
the 90

1035
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:32,369
and it may be that now people are

1036
00:53:32,369 --> 00:53:33,810
working in a much more

1037
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:36,089
collaborative way and that they care more

1038
00:53:36,089 --> 00:53:38,849
about quality what do you think about  of

1039
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:42,050
these types of communities,

1040
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:46,260
well, the truth is that he was not an

1041
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,590
active member of the hac community.

1042
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:53,670
I used to make them old kers but the truth is

1043
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:58,110
that I was busy seeing that the

1044
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,430
systems that I have executed that

1045
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:01,740
were working perfectly

1046
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,510
I know that some person has

1047
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:06,090
therefore been open because you also have to be

1048
00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:09,210
accepted within this group within

1049
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:13,140
this club and  This was before everything

1050
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:16,130
was connected continuously

1051
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:19,530
so it seems to me that part of the

1052
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:21,420
technology key has also made it much

1053
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:24,540
easier but in general I like

1054
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:28,860
the opening of power and generating this and I

1055
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:32,010
love welcoming people

1056
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:36,770
to connect different people and

1057
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:42,340
there are people who consider that

1058
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:46,000
and be able to be alone and who are

1059
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,720
learning different people also

1060
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,390
which is called why we are

1061
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:54,670
working with others and we are standing

1062
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:56,800
on the shoulders of other people

1063
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,260
then the best that we are as a

1064
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:02,740
community  and please excuse me for being

1065
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:06,630
so idealistic towards society because

1066
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:10,720
also this year unfortunately we

1067
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:14,560
cannot be together  but

1068
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:17,710
as humans

1069
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:20,950
we are social creatures we have

1070
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:24,310
different resources to establish

1071
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:26,440
communities of knowledge sharing

1072
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:30,490
we are all in this together and it seems

1073
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:32,980
to me that this is something fantastic there are still

1074
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:36,130
people who are probably

1075
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:37,990
problematic within their communities

1076
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:41,890
and who tend to be quite scandalous

1077
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:44,339
but also

1078
00:55:44,339 --> 00:55:46,079
And all the people who have been

1079
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:48,719
participating today are here

1080
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:51,319
to be able to learn, share,

1081
00:55:51,319 --> 00:55:54,900
connect and learn, and that has been

1082
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:57,480
fantastic,

1083
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:02,310
great and by the way, this conference

1084
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:04,800
has been quite convenient because it

1085
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,109
is all over the world because it has helped us to

1086
00:56:07,109 --> 00:56:12,150
bring together the  community and also support

1087
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:13,859
new professionals and

1088
00:56:13,859 --> 00:56:15,510
students who want to be part of

1089
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:17,930
this community

1090
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:20,849
yes yes please

1091
00:56:20,849 --> 00:56:24,509
if you have done many events in

1092
00:56:24,509 --> 00:56:27,559
the last decades

1093
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:34,920
and there have been 630 events say security

1094
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:37,530
in the world so far to 192

1095
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:40,660
cities 54 countries

1096
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:44,849
and  There have been 25 virtual events

1097
00:56:44,849 --> 00:56:48,599
years and of course everyone sees it.

1098
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:51,599
Today we all know that I would prefer for

1099
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:53,609
those people who know me I

1100
00:56:53,609 --> 00:56:55,769
love to hug I am a scorcher I

1101
00:56:55,769 --> 00:56:58,680
would give hugs to everyone but

1102
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,239
for now

1103
00:57:00,239 --> 00:57:03,269
we are going to have to settle for that

1104
00:57:03,269 --> 00:57:04,649
until we can see each other like that maybe

1105
00:57:04,649 --> 00:57:06,989
touch  fists or elbows until

1106
00:57:06,989 --> 00:57:09,599
this pandemic is under control and it is

1107
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:11,429
good for us as a

1108
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:13,889
hacker community it is good for us as

1109
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:16,039
a tech security community it

1110
00:57:16,039 --> 00:57:18,479
is good for the industry and it is good

1111
00:57:18,479 --> 00:57:20,279
for us as people to also

1112
00:57:20,279 --> 00:57:24,149
connect with each other and with  certainty in a couple

1113
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:26,699
of questions but I'm going to merge both

1114
00:57:26,699 --> 00:57:29,539
questions to ask the question I have

1115
00:57:29,539 --> 00:57:33,209
questions from joe and cristian nada from

1116
00:57:33,209 --> 00:57:35,680
lewis too

1117
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,079
and they are connected if they ask me

1118
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:41,069
about

1119
00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:44,550
the industry trends in industry

1120
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:46,800
what do you think about trends in

1121
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,230
industry infotec in

1122
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:51,930
machine learning terms

1123
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:54,270
artificial intelligence and cloud internet of

1124
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:57,000
things with 211 mix like any

1125
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,500
other  n about following trends

1126
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,480
and you already said in your presentation that

1127
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,460
you are not a

1128
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:05,670
and do not forget the word sorry that I

1129
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:07,260
am not futuristic and this was the

1130
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:09,630
futuristic word no in fact I have made

1131
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:14,550
some very obvious predictions and I have

1132
00:58:14,550 --> 00:58:16,950
not even altered the

1133
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:18,510
story corsair saying obvious things that

1134
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:21,100
have not happened or that have happened and well

1135
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:24,340
I must say as an old

1136
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:26,350
school security management person

1137
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:30,730
I think it is promising

1138
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:35,710
that as more I work with

1139
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:38,470
people who are native to the cloud not

1140
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:40,060
people  they are bringing

1141
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:41,590
old technology not as I

1142
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:43,690
work more with people who are native

1143
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:46,810
to cloud security there is much more

1144
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:49,080
optimism

1145
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:51,860
there is much more optimism about modern security

1146
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:54,750
in this community and it looks like

1147
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:57,810
it is going to go back to things we do

1148
00:58:57,810 --> 00:59:01,140
local too  We execute in the group

1149
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:04,040
that you see that they are teaching us how to

1150
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:08,370
integrate ourselves into the development process and it

1151
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:09,809
is

1152
00:59:09,809 --> 00:59:13,079
and thus there was a really people

1153
00:59:13,079 --> 00:59:16,140
have lived for ad  Direct from the person

1154
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:19,140
who are starting and still do not trust

1155
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:22,499
but I find it interesting that there is a

1156
00:59:22,499 --> 00:59:25,109
very quick dismissal with respect to all

1157
00:59:25,109 --> 00:59:26,069
the challenges

1158
00:59:26,069 --> 00:59:29,489
and this is not this unit of understanding or

1159
00:59:29,489 --> 00:59:32,030
working the developers

1160
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:34,520
how the development process

1161
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:37,610
works how the management of  products

1162
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:38,990
I want to understand all these things

1163
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:41,630
we can fit in better we can become

1164
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:44,869
part of their teams that create the software

1165
00:59:44,869 --> 00:59:49,099
because until we improve how

1166
00:59:49,099 --> 00:59:51,470
the software is used

1167
00:59:51,470 --> 00:59:53,890
we are going to continue simply

1168
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:57,990
we are going to keep things

1169
00:59:57,990 --> 01:00:01,420
going and we are going to keep trying to put the band-

1170
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:04,330
aid patch on the  wounds instead

1171
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:06,670
of creating safe restart software so

1172
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:08,080
I hope that with this

1173
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:11,410
machine learning and free artificial intelligence

1174
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:13,300
has a place because I see that they

1175
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:15,700
are valuable I am sure that

1176
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,500
we all have stories where things

1177
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:20,680
are algorithms work very badly and if they

1178
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:23,100
can  be misused if they can be

1179
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:25,390
taken over by other people and controlled

1180
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:26,860
by other people  It seems to me that we

1181
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:28,750
are not going to get

1182
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:32,190
the promised benefits, it

1183
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:35,540
is particularly when the absence of

1184
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:38,750
natural language in artificial intelligence

1185
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:40,940
seems to me that it is still

1186
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:44,240
a distant dream but statistics things

1187
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,340
for example are

1188
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:49,900
progressing and we are being forced

1189
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:53,480
to be friendly  with the rest of the

1190
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:55,820
development with the rest of the complete

1191
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:58,490
software and since we are talking

1192
01:00:58,490 --> 01:01:02,740
about the history and evolution

1193
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:07,130
of the industry in cybersecurity it

1194
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:08,980
does not seem

1195
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:11,440
that sometimes

1196
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,900
and we continue to make the same mistakes

1197
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:16,839
over and over again but if we analyze for

1198
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:19,140
example

1199
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:21,630
and vulnerabilities the top 10

1200
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:23,680
vulnerabilities

1201
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,660
these are things that are managed for

1202
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:30,540
many years and remain similar

1203
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:34,339
we always keep talking about the

1204
01:01:34,339 --> 01:01:37,510
same vulnerabilities about

1205
01:01:37,510 --> 01:01:39,980
making sure with our resources and the

1206
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:42,230
issues or problems are not really

1207
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:45,150
changing for us we

1208
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:46,950
already have a  long history of an

1209
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:50,190
industry always both the same

1210
01:01:50,190 --> 01:01:52,789
problems one  and again you

1211
01:01:52,789 --> 01:01:55,710
have something frustrating from a

1212
01:01:55,710 --> 01:01:58,289


1213
01:01:58,289 --> 01:02:00,029
security protection perspective we are not sure laying

1214
01:02:00,029 --> 01:02:02,720
much apparently

1215
01:02:03,069 --> 01:02:07,180
and it is frustrating it seems to me that there is a

1216
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:09,339
point here

1217
01:02:09,339 --> 01:02:11,229
or well there are a handful of things that

1218
01:02:11,229 --> 01:02:12,970
happen

1219
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:15,550
in a progression in the computer industry

1220
01:02:15,550 --> 01:02:17,509


1221
01:02:17,509 --> 01:02:19,579
that  They have taken us to where we are

1222
01:02:19,579 --> 01:02:21,829
now and we are basically playing to

1223
01:02:21,829 --> 01:02:23,929
keep up to date and some problems is

1224
01:02:23,929 --> 01:02:27,109
that well, dry research with

1225
01:02:27,109 --> 01:02:29,599
respect and a team ready seven things and it

1226
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:33,009
is a list of seven things that

1227
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:37,359
needed to be repaired to

1228
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:39,150
improve security things like authentication for example

1229
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:41,650
authorization and identity

1230
01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:42,940
and these are things that are still

1231
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:46,779
difficulties, although they are improving,

1232
01:02:46,779 --> 01:02:48,859
yes, but there

1233
01:02:48,859 --> 01:02:51,609
was talk about

1234
01:02:51,609 --> 01:02:56,710
race conditions of logical errors

1235
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,670
one of the things that is important to note

1236
01:02:58,670 --> 01:03:03,410
is that in the seventies these were issues and

1237
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:05,840
in fact we have done a good job  with

1238
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:07,530
industry

1239
01:03:07,530 --> 01:03:11,190
in terms of cleaning is today we are not

1240
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:16,200
perfect again but not with the

1241
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,880
operative when the co  sas are well

1242
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:21,300
connected, it is easy to make mistakes

1243
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:25,590
because there are new plots that we are

1244
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:28,290
using more modern tools and techniques,

1245
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:30,330
which feels a bit but the risk

1246
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:31,890
continues to leah and part of this transition

1247
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:34,320
began in the 70's if it will continue until the

1248
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:39,270
70's if it's okay and what  What happened is

1249
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:41,710
that computers used to be

1250
01:03:41,710 --> 01:03:45,609
huge costly public objects and

1251
01:03:45,609 --> 01:03:47,710
later she was a wife among the

1252
01:03:47,710 --> 01:03:50,410
consumer and they became moving things

1253
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:52,810
like anyone who could

1254
01:03:52,810 --> 01:03:55,750
pay could buy one and that was not the case in

1255
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:58,990
the 66 sales therefore if she saw that

1256
01:03:58,990 --> 01:04:02,349
the pressure  having more became a

1257
01:04:02,349 --> 01:04:04,119
commodity and therefore they are no longer

1258
01:04:04,119 --> 01:04:06,869
expensive therefore you

1259
01:04:06,869 --> 01:04:09,190
basically buy a light bulb and have

1260
01:04:09,190 --> 01:04:11,650
servers so the hardware is

1261
01:04:11,650 --> 01:04:14,140
monetized or it became a consumer good

1262
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:15,970
and the important thing that happened was that the

1263
01:04:15,970 --> 01:04:18,580
software also became  a

1264
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:20,890
consumer good also became a commodity

1265
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:23,710
including development is software and

1266
01:04:23,710 --> 01:04:26,050
you didn't have to be a programmer to create

1267
01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:27,790
a website.  You have to be a

1268
01:04:27,790 --> 01:04:31,290
programmer to create a website

1269
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:33,180
you can simply put together a couple of

1270
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:35,160
things in html and voila, the problem is that

1271
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:37,410
you connect a database and there you already

1272
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:39,870
created a problem because you have

1273
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:42,510
authentication errors, it is no

1274
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:44,420
limit

1275
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:47,420
of your brigade and we continue  looking at this

1276
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:51,860
type of local problems or we are

1277
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:53,990
allowing stress downloads directories

1278
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:55,640
that should not allow it etc.

1279
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:59,060
etc. errors in references and if they

1280
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:00,530
are disappearing little by little but

1281
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:02,590
what happens is that everything has been democratized,

1282
01:05:02,590 --> 01:05:05,300
we can do it but we are not

1283
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:07,190
all professionals and that is  It has led

1284
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:09,230
to different challenges so I will make

1285
01:05:09,230 --> 01:05:13,010
more and more tools and honestly I

1286
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:14,420
see many people who make fun of

1287
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:18,380
people who not people who make

1288
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:20,570
fun of those who do not create their own

1289
01:05:20,570 --> 01:05:22,940
websites make a few dollars to a

1290
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:25,790
company to have a website and  ready

1291
01:05:25,790 --> 01:05:28,340
but because they make fun if that is

1292
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:30,500
great because first people

1293
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:33,610
truths of safety for people

1294
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:35,840
r  Responsible for that and that because no

1295
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:37,370
one can identify the problem to

1296
01:05:37,370 --> 01:05:41,270
solve the proxy of the tools

1297
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:45,880
is all to improve but it is very big

1298
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:49,509


1299
01:05:51,109 --> 01:05:52,700
one of the things that I mentioned

1300
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:55,549
before that has to do with the cloud is

1301
01:05:55,549 --> 01:05:58,569
that we have done it  easier to

1302
01:05:58,569 --> 01:06:01,099
get what we want without having to

1303
01:06:01,099 --> 01:06:03,230
build it seems to me that in this way

1304
01:06:03,230 --> 01:06:05,869
less people are going to be themselves and

1305
01:06:05,869 --> 01:06:07,029
in this way mind

1306
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:09,499
but in my final point about it is

1307
01:06:09,499 --> 01:06:11,060
who

1308
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:14,480
we have been creating certain

1309
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:17,360
specific things and current status tends to

1310
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:19,430
be used  much more than

1311
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:21,670
we thought for much longer so

1312
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:24,650
for example I need a website for

1313
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:26,330
this marketing campaign and we

1314
01:06:26,330 --> 01:06:29,720
are only going to use it for two months and in five

1315
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:31,269
years

1316
01:06:31,269 --> 01:06:34,929
it is still somewhere dark on

1317
01:06:34,929 --> 01:06:37,029
the property and unfortunately how

1318
01:06:37,029 --> 01:06:39,369
was it if  has access to the

1319
01:06:39,369 --> 01:06:42,489
customer database no one has patched it no one

1320
01:06:42,489 --> 01:06:44,109
has done a job because

1321
01:06:44,109 --> 01:06:46,029
we all think it no longer exists and that is one

1322
01:06:46,029 --> 01:06:48,309
of our challenges because  That this does not

1323
01:06:48,309 --> 01:06:50,049
die when we simply want it to

1324
01:06:50,049 --> 01:06:52,670
die and yes

1325
01:06:52,670 --> 01:06:55,520
on the other side sometimes it is true

1326
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:58,309
we want to find something and we can

1327
01:06:58,309 --> 01:06:59,930
find it that is good but vulnerable things

1328
01:06:59,930 --> 01:07:01,579
could simply be

1329
01:07:01,579 --> 01:07:04,150
left there

1330
01:07:05,850 --> 01:07:09,840
we have one and it seems to me that we have already

1331
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:13,270
listened and I thank you

1332
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:16,270
I am one of the thousands of people

1333
01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:18,850
who work on this around the world and

1334
01:07:18,850 --> 01:07:25,180
I am very proud that my life is

1335
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:27,130
revolving around I am in a couple of years

1336
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:28,660
we have made a big difference in

1337
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:32,680
terms of the organization of pizza is

1338
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:34,770
list and it

1339
01:07:34,770 --> 01:07:37,170
is  one of the

1340
01:07:37,170 --> 01:07:39,150
most important security conferences in brazil for the

1341
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:41,610
community and I really like it

1342
01:07:41,610 --> 01:07:43,830
very much

1343
01:07:43,830 --> 01:07:47,750
and all the credit goes to you

1344
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:57,839
thank you very much

1345
01:07:57,839 --> 01:08:00,839
and implant me

1346
01:08:00,839 --> 01:08:03,109
and my last question

1347
01:08:03,109 --> 01:08:05,690
later could you go with us a little

1348
01:08:05,690 --> 01:08:10,099
about how was the

1349
01:08:10,099 --> 01:08:12,170
peace conference  marks and what was the idea behind

1350
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:15,650
it to create views to make it happen

1351
01:08:15,650 --> 01:08:18,649
and again thank you very much for all

1352
01:08:18,649 --> 01:08:20,719
your ideas thank you very much for

1353
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:22,819
sharing this you  po rave of dzokic

1354
01:08:22,819 --> 01:08:26,670
insights distributed all over the world

1355
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:30,359
get thanks because I have to start with

1356
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:32,819
that they give me too much credit per view it

1357
01:08:32,819 --> 01:08:36,359
is true I am the only person who has

1358
01:08:36,359 --> 01:08:38,969
been involved that is the first of the

1359
01:08:38,969 --> 01:08:39,779
product

1360
01:08:39,779 --> 01:08:41,069
yes it is true but that is basically

1361
01:08:41,069 --> 01:08:45,870
because I have the  Chicken of very

1362
01:08:45,870 --> 01:08:48,689
good collaborators but really this requires

1363
01:08:48,689 --> 01:08:50,429
thousands of people around the world for

1364
01:08:50,429 --> 01:08:52,890
it to happen and I did encourage people

1365
01:08:52,890 --> 01:08:56,460
to commented Díaz gave moral support

1366
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:58,009
not people

1367
01:08:58,009 --> 01:09:00,390
like all many others are the ones who

1368
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:02,299
do the hard work and in the year  2009

1369
01:09:02,299 --> 01:09:06,049
some things are happening a

1370
01:09:06,490 --> 01:09:09,729
lot to that if much of the food

1371
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:12,049
this twitter meeting

1372
01:09:12,049 --> 01:09:16,368
and our friend jacob & joe discovered a

1373
01:09:16,368 --> 01:09:18,618
group of people who text on twitter

1374
01:09:18,618 --> 01:09:21,290
to communicate between our

1375
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:23,389
monthly meetings and we began to

1376
01:09:23,389 --> 01:09:25,670
keep in touch to see not

1377
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:28,670
only discounted  in other conferences or for

1378
01:09:28,670 --> 01:09:30,679
those of us who were in the

1379
01:09:30,679 --> 01:09:32,448
hacker community and also in other communities

1380
01:09:32,448 --> 01:09:35,678
perhaps in the rest

1381
01:09:35,830 --> 01:09:39,130
in the even  regional teams will begin to

1382
01:09:39,130 --> 01:09:42,420
maintain contact and really

1383
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:44,698
shelter that some fabrics were not going to

1384
01:09:44,698 --> 01:09:46,979
be true in defcon and well because that is

1385
01:09:46,979 --> 01:09:48,750
where you are going to put them we think that is why

1386
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:50,488
they reject them but what we saw was that

1387
01:09:50,488 --> 01:09:52,948
finally there were certain talks are

1388
01:09:52,948 --> 01:09:55,909
certain presentations

1389
01:09:55,909 --> 01:09:58,909
and we thought that  interesting but it's going to be

1390
01:09:58,909 --> 01:10:00,949
interesting for 20 people it's going to be

1391
01:10:00,949 --> 01:10:03,909
interesting for 30 people it's not going to

1392
01:10:03,909 --> 01:10:07,710
fill a large room

1393
01:10:07,710 --> 01:10:09,420
well that's what

1394
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:12,900
large conferences need they

1395
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:15,670
need to fill large rooms need to be filled to places

1396
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:18,370
well who's the problem, what a shame there is

1397
01:10:18,370 --> 01:10:20,230
nowhere  where people who

1398
01:10:20,230 --> 01:10:22,270
have those interests can make their

1399
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:23,590
presentation share it with the

1400
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:26,230
right audience so we think about

1401
01:10:26,230 --> 01:10:29,080
this a bit more if you have a couple of

1402
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:31,239
presentations and chose that I understand

1403
01:10:31,239 --> 01:10:33,850
why you are because you are on this

1404
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:36,160
list or to create a scenario because

1405
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:38,200
If it is an intelligent idea if it is true

1406
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:40,450
or it is a promising project if it is true

1407
01:10:40,450 --> 01:10:43,150
but how bad how sad it is, it has not  and place

1408
01:10:43,150 --> 01:10:44,980
for this person to present it

1409
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:48,580
to receive feedback and to

1410
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:50,890
create a better presentation or to

1411
01:10:50,890 --> 01:10:53,980
create a great software project

1412
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:56,590
then we saw other things that were

1413
01:10:56,590 --> 01:10:58,450
simply too social or

1414
01:10:58,450 --> 01:11:00,640
political or were there on the verge of

1415
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:03,670
being and one of them was the issues

1416
01:11:03,670 --> 01:11:06,190
gender women in the industry and

1417
01:11:06,190 --> 01:11:08,410
in 2009 there really was no

1418
01:11:08,410 --> 01:11:09,550
place

1419
01:11:09,550 --> 01:11:11,950
I think that no one was ready to

1420
01:11:11,950 --> 01:11:14,530
have that conversation and we said oops how

1421
01:11:14,530 --> 01:11:16,330
bad we could not just bring

1422
01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:17,470
these people together and then we

1423
01:11:17,470 --> 01:11:20,650
realized that we had said other times

1424
01:11:20,650 --> 01:11:22,480
I wish  that we had a place

1425
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:23,980
for people to share that information and

1426
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:28,000
cris micros are the wine where we

1427
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,770
had not joined in computing and

1428
01:11:29,770 --> 01:11:31,780
also other people and we said ok

1429
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:34,270
let's make it happen let's do it this summer

1430
01:11:34,270 --> 01:11:36,430
we can do it

1431
01:11:36,430 --> 01:11:40,800
and then there was a current of

1432
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,910
sadness except for  on

1433
01:11:42,910 --> 01:11:45,550
commercialization of events and was

1434
01:11:45,550 --> 01:11:48,280
lacking in this sense of community

1435
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:49,780
as  It grows things because we

1436
01:11:49,780 --> 01:11:52,690
love how it conceives, but it is very

1437
01:11:52,690 --> 01:11:54,500
overwhelming.

1438
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:58,190
Well, this contest to make beers I

1439
01:11:58,190 --> 01:12:00,050
don't know I participate in many things the stubborn one

1440
01:12:00,050 --> 01:12:04,490
or I love fonsi but it is a very

1441
01:12:04,490 --> 01:12:06,980
good conference especially

1442
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:10,280
when they left the scissors to stop them

1443
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:12,860
but at that moment if  there was frustration

1444
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:15,110
so we did it and we wanted to create a

1445
01:12:15,110 --> 01:12:16,969
series either but people loved

1446
01:12:16,969 --> 01:12:20,929
the idea of being able to meet and if the

1447
01:12:20,929 --> 01:12:23,000
speaker or the person did not want the

1448
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,690
cameras ready there were no cameras and with that

1449
01:12:26,690 --> 01:12:29,690
we just did it and people wanted

1450
01:12:29,690 --> 01:12:31,789
more so  we did another later in

1451
01:12:31,789 --> 01:12:34,659
the year and during rca I like francisco

1452
01:12:34,659 --> 01:12:37,550
we did another one in simplistic o and later

1453
01:12:37,550 --> 01:12:40,190
in boston and we returned a year later in

1454
01:12:40,190 --> 01:12:42,829
2010 and it was like this I said today it seems that

1455
01:12:42,829 --> 01:12:45,199
we started something and now that as I said

1456
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:50,510
before something that started and that's it  There are 630

1457
01:12:50,510 --> 01:12:54,170
events and the only continent where

1458
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:56,150
they have not been done is the Antarctic of the people

1459
01:12:56,150 --> 01:12:58,579
they tell me we are going to do the cycles we

1460
01:12:58,579 --> 01:13:00,440
cannot change that for sure yes of course

1461
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:03,860
yes v  We are going to have to do what we are going

1462
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:07,369
to have to do Patagonia visas in

1463
01:13:07,369 --> 01:13:10,429
cinema, what do you think, Gabriel, we are going to

1464
01:13:10,429 --> 01:13:14,590
do it at the end of the big sight world

1465
01:13:14,930 --> 01:13:16,820
and then we can do the

1466
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:19,750
next step, which would be to go to Antarctica.

1467
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:21,280
Yes, of course, of

1468
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:24,610
course, then we could  go to the

1469
01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:26,619
space station later go to

1470
01:13:26,619 --> 01:13:31,199
mars of course I saw sites in the

1471
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:34,329
international space station so well it

1472
01:13:34,329 --> 01:13:36,880
has been great and some of the

1473
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:39,849
elements are quite large

1474
01:13:39,849 --> 01:13:41,889
when we talk about 1,2,000 people you

1475
01:13:41,889 --> 01:13:44,920
saw las vegas last year it was

1476
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:47,380
more than 3,000 professionals and  On the other

1477
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:49,030
hand, if there are also other

1478
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:52,900
pistachio nations that have 2025 people but

1479
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:54,190
places are made where basically

1480
01:13:54,190 --> 01:13:57,440
there is no alternative, therefore

1481
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:01,610
I try to emphasize that the event does not

1482
01:14:01,610 --> 01:14:06,849
matter if

1483
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:14,230
anything extra

1484
01:14:14,510 --> 01:14:18,070
is shared, it can be done in different

1485
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:22,690
when you are  I'm sure I'm going to be

1486
01:14:22,690 --> 01:14:24,620
content

1487
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:30,290
along the main coasts and well, it

1488
01:14:30,290 --> 01:14:31,550
has been difficult this year but we have

1489
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:34,880
learned many things  They had pain and I

1490
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:37,010
hope that this continues to evolve and

1491
01:14:37,010 --> 01:14:40,280
sites and other conferences such as this one

1492
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:45,070
have to do with connecting and creating as

1493
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:47,860
well, thank you very much Jack for

1494
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:50,440
this great talk and for sharing

1495
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:54,400
your ideas with us and now we are going to

1496
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:58,780
return to our transmission then

1497
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:01,380

1501

been incredible really

1502
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:42,420
