south america

49
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,310
if we waited  having them we are thinking

50
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,490
that in my mind that we are legends

51
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,009
because a long time ago we were

52
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:56,189
the first pages of the latest

53
00:04:56,189 --> 00:04:58,740
news they

54
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:05,480
said the beautiful heritage and the

55
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:10,160
good wish I want to show you this my scale

56
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,310
of eight plans of my tablet this is

57
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,440
fun because the first time I

58
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,520
listen  this is i said oh no this

59
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,640
sucks i dont think so but it happens this is

60
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,790
normal evolution  of the different

61
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,640
markets and the different systems

62
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,240
so this is a story about these

63
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,350
attacks but we also wanted to be

64
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,330
friends with them that is why we are

65
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:42,080
legends and we also saw different areas

66
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,900
of intelligence and different

67
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,210
investigative approaches

68
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:51,990
and it was we are going to  be together one

69
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,700
and the truth is that we do not know who they

70
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,870
are in the audience so I think I

71
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,440
do it slowly and step by step I want to

72
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,970
tell you that it is scale that is on that

73
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:10,440
axis is also some slides

74
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:16,470
about these uses a little history

75
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:22,350
that this is not intentionally extracted

76
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:25,879
when we started in addition to the

77
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:28,129
positive that there will be

78
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:30,249
some people who were also

79
00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:33,349
doing training for the

80
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:35,719
united nations I think that was a

81
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:38,360
long time ago since we started with

82
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,619
that and attract different experts in the

83
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:45,439
escada security systems and in

84
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:49,279
good we began to analyze the

85
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:52,550
different work together with selena but

86
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:57,249
as we love

87
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:02,130
all the  to people of the team and well we said

88
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,340
that we were going to start with a gift this

89
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,830
is a clip that has not been released

90
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,690
yet and before launching it we are going to

91
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:13,320
start having about 89 minutes it is in

92
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:17,370
English his name is jack mckeon and we want to

93
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,750
tell you the story of this  clip the

94
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,970
good thing is very likely that about ten

95
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,310
years ago

96
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,930
we were working with nato to

97
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,050
be able to train cyberterrorists

98
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:31,860
that is the issue and I, despite taking a

99
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,560
different approach, it was not very academic

100
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,100
at all so I wanted to see try to

101
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,640
play and then be able to understand  So

102
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,740
I did an analysis that for me was

103
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,360
quite shocking for the people

104
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,010
who were there and we analyzed many

105
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:56,820
vulnerabilities in different areas and in

106
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,980
different sectors such as finance,

107
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:06,580
the sector to make

108
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,400
these vulnerabilities that were already known different intimate

109
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,550


110
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:17,610
and we asked ourselves how to see how groups

111
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:22,250
of cyberterrorists would be  able to

112
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,440
put all this in a framework and

113
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,590
proceed that happens and that is what

114
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,310
acme keaton

115
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:35,159
e  Then I want that we can do it

116
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,610
please

117
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,940
about the circus the technical containment garden

118
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,750


119
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,870
we have difficulties

120
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:02,689
so cybersecurity says that the

121
00:11:02,689 --> 00:11:05,620
cashiers have been infected with an

122

abdo worm that is uninhabited all

123

urban guerrillas who were fighting to obtain

132
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:43,270
these resources Tuesday 6 in the afternoon

133
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,790

145
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,310
the subjects of  naval military and

civilian control were literally blind

147
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,269
Wednesday 6 am

148

terrorist organization called ABC,

157
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,630
no vital sector of the country could be

158
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,700
considered trustworthy and all

159
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,769
citizens wondered that they were

160
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:12,140
asked to forgive them for not leaving their homes,

161

00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,360
presented in distint  The cities Saturday

173
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,590
7 pm the

174
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,870
whole country goes without electricity

175
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,320
stop the attacks of

176
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,149
massive onion cyberattacks in different areas

177
00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:00,199
all the systems of the

178
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:01,670
international people can not provide

179
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,670
energy to more than 75 percent of the

180
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:07,009
whole country the generated and the

181
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:09,490
generators systems  of ups did not work

182
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:14,019
Sunday 5 am

183
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,900
more than 30,000 soldiers of the

184
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,810
terrorist group sometimes attack and take

185
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,410
control of the country

186
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:27,300
disorders murders violence and

187
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,500
rapes it is reported from the

188
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,350
main cities small

189
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,020
towns in all parts of the country the

190
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,970
prime minister has been assassinated

191
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,520
robberies occur to  every minute and the

192
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,640
situation is close to nothing to a state of

193
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,760
civil war national security is a

194
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,830
big problem the person is trying

195
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,560
to get away from the country by crossing the

196
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,650
borders and by all means they are

197
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,360
asking neighboring nations to

198
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,420
please asylum as  war refugees

199
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,569


200
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:11,779
but only a few will survive

201
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:25,120
but this must never happen

202
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,170
this is so  sorry a science fiction scenario

203
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,339


204
00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:37,269
for nothing

205
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,870
these are the news of every day

206
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,700
and it is also a known story of

207
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,090
all these vulnerabilities this happens

208
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,850
because we have cyberattacks that are well

209
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:10,180
planned and designed and

210
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,270
armed with a single distributed framework

211
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,360
could also guide  to

212
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,370
quite significant problems problems of the

213
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,950
people who are responsible for

214
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:25,330
always the bad ones the lack of security

215
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,340
the bad passwords that are not very

216
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,190
secure systems that are

217
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:33,810
outdated in management problems

218
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:45,279
then

219
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,040
what should we do

220
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,540
public security secure your

221
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,900
critical infrastructures with

222
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,330
technologies that should be  state-of-the-

223
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:02,780
art and comply with all the

224
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:07,270
strictest security standards

225
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:13,250
but first and foremost

226
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,720
connect and share your knowledge of

227
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,059
cyber threats and the risks in

228
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:26,849
security information the boys are

229
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:29,820
bad share that is why they are so

230
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,159
strong and we  the good ones should

231
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,880
h  do the same

232
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,460
and last but not least

233
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:41,370
train your staff help them

234
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,360


235
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:51,408
become your human firewall

236
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,640
very well let's share again

237
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,830
let's do the sharing game

238
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,250
very well here we go can you see my

239
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,370
perfect full screen a second

240
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:41,000
please

241
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:55,180
now  yes we are in full screen yes

242
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,890
very well some comments and

243
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:59,320
later I have some questions

244
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,570
to ask gabriel díaz federico

245
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,059
dancing

246
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:12,678
I have decided then

247
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,260
unfortunately because of what is said at the

248
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,470
end and it is not by chance that I decided to

249
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,390
share it because it is in the

250
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,760
security community  And it is a non-

251
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,670
American instance, although I think that in 2008,

252
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:30,450
nice points I shared other points that

253
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,280
exist all over the world.

254
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,620


255
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,450


256
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,400


257
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,670


258
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:44,010
and federico enjoying the app

259
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:47,030
made them think of something

260
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,910
good it reminded me a bit of 2020 el

261
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:58,100
fernando  It was like turning on the TV

262
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:01,900
but I think it

263
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,450
is like seeing the worst possible impact in

264
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,910
an attack and what would happen if we

265
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:09,430
really did not pay attention and do not

266
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:13,240
take action with regard to

267
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,560
governments to health services, now

268
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,540
we have a lot of critical infrastructure

269
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,120
Trades infrastructure is not

270
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,370
available what we should think about if we have

271
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,930
a plan b it seems to me that that is the

272
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,930
lesson that I will take if thank you very

273
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:31,990
much let's start then with some

274
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,850
comments about me that is me I

275
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,890
really do not care about the brand of the

276
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:37,870
conference nobody cares  It

277
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:41,320
matters more to him the experience of 2002 in

278
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,280
the la at the un with the

279
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,340
regional research institute and then I

280
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,530
started working in another organization

281
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:56,540
yt enisa and other community office the

282
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:00,500
us of drugs and crimes now I do not believe

283
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,980
in the community so

284
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:06,400
and working  can

285
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,120
security standards for testing in different

286
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,850
organizations like ap

287
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,040
w and post some comments

288
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,070
about excellent  nte and well I am

289
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,809
a computer engineer of the computation

290
00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:22,720
dedicated did not imply and I started with a

291
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,450
digital investigation

292
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:28,640
when I was very young

293
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:30,900
I love it I really love this part

294
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,090
but that fortunately

295
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:35,580
today we have many cases

296
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,040
not only the issue of escada that we have

297
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,330
presented today but

298
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,860
also a lot regarding

299
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,140
child pornography and others

300
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,730
therefore all crimes related

301
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:49,590
to this and I really feel the honor

302
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,770
of being a founding part of xto which is the

303
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,140
security organization of europe in

304
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:59,790
brussels and also  of women in the

305
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:02,480
world medical action that is the European association

306
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,519


307
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:08,570
the area that would like to bring together

308
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:11,389
even women to join

309
00:22:11,389 --> 00:22:14,149
this field because I know that there are very

310
00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:17,359
few women in this field and there

311
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:19,609
are also many appointments many girls

312
00:22:19,609 --> 00:22:23,089
students who begin  their studies

313
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:25,759
at the university or even younger and they

314
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:28,369
wonder how I could get to these

315
00:22:28,369 --> 00:22:30,409
kinds of jobs and also  n It

316
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:31,729
has to do with promoting

317
00:22:31,729 --> 00:22:35,059
safety and security relationships for

318
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:36,589
women to join this world of

319
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:39,200
work and well that's why I married

320
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,599
one of those few women who are every

321
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:43,729
then control, supervision and

322
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,259
data acquisition and it is another

323
00:22:45,259 --> 00:22:49,249
acronym  that we add to the world of

324
00:22:49,249 --> 00:22:51,889
security and what it does is the

325
00:22:51,889 --> 00:22:53,979
monitoring branch of an

326
00:22:53,979 --> 00:22:56,709
automated infrastructure and the critical thing here is that you

327
00:22:56,709 --> 00:23:00,079
decide you want to do based on

328
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,678
what is happening

329
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:07,050
is something new not the truth again

330
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:10,670
with this when  my father decided to

331
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:13,500
join his company and work on

332
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,840
automatic doors and things so I

333
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,330
started with this one

334
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:22,110
in three years so that is a being they are

335
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:25,590
long or online someone is speaking

336
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,720
is everything fine it is not only an

337
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,120
open microphone or that there is everything  well there is no

338
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,690
problem

339
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:34,659
what happens then what happens is that

340
00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:37,269
the market is migrating and for a long

341
00:23:37,269 --> 00:23:38,799
time it was doing it a long time ago it

342
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,720
was very difficult to

343
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,899
create or make security  or

344
00:23:43,899 --> 00:23:45,370
proven security breaches because there was no

345
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,620
documentation of something very mysterious

346
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,679
there were only a few providers like the

347
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,100
three big providers that are

348
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,350
really known all over the world and the truth

349
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,720
is that they did not like to share and they continue to

350
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,120
have this way of acting

351
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,809
where they try  keep

352
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:08,080
the knowledge to themselves but then the

353
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,340
world changed

354
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,960
and I will tell you about it in some slides

355
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,320
but before that we try to clarify a

356
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,320
little what I mean and what does it mean

357
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:23,360
then ccm and with the examples here and

358
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,010
it has happened to me in the career that I have

359
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:27,380
had  the possible what to do for

360
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,600
security in nuclear plants

361
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,490
sometimes also with

362
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:35,460
water companies definition of

363
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,590
transport water of oil gas etc.

364
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:40,250
etc. so it has to do with this

365
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,980
even though I believe in this and

366
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,820
you can see it directly

367
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,519
in the  that of a major

368
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:52,880
participant in italy a short time ago

369
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,220
often has more problems when

370
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,409
there is a lack of com  unication with

371
00:25:00,409 --> 00:25:02,720
respect to the incident that what has

372
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,779
caused the incident really this is

373
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:08,630
something that I will show you and I will show some

374
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:11,450
incidents that have been public

375
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:13,610
now what has changed as I

376
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:15,980
said before and that will be the end

377
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,480
of time so I will start to

378
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:22,519
hurry a little bit more in the 80s 82

379
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:24,440
sales to their water distribution company

380
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,649
who really didn't care

381
00:25:27,649 --> 00:25:30,590
I counted and had no interest in the

382
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:34,490
attacks and they didn't care at

383
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:38,260
all they just did their job

384
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,810
the calculations had only been seen in

385
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:44,410
the movies  and we went to the

386
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:47,020
control room, therefore, as

387
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,650
required to have me in triple-a

388
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:52,590
what has changed and what are

389
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,980
these

390
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:04,760
in the case of banking, the

391
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,490


392
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:10,280
self-service financial sector tangency and the government

393
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,290
is a view

394
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:15,560
at a high level  that we are not going to talk

395
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,890
about every excellent point, be

396
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:21,260
ready but here I would like to talk for

397
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,820
example about the energy and

398
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,130
basic services sector I am not going to talk about

399
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:28,810
about this in some detail and the same with

400
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:32,919
the last 5

401
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,620
now I just want to mention some of

402
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:40,220
the techniques because we do not know if the

403
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,770
entire audience is familiar with this

404
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,420
because it also has acronyms

405
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:49,130
everywhere we have cnc s plc or

406
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:51,399
active preset

407
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:53,460
is important  know the terms

408
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:57,279
because that is where the turns actually occur

409
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,580


410
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,860
as I mentioned earlier from

411
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,920
the past if we compare ourselves to the 80s and

412
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,250
90s today and when I say hey chirp

413
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,440
I mean the last 15 to 20 years

414
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,650
all bad infrastructure  regardless of

415
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:19,020
whether they want to or not, all of them have

416
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,940
migrated and passed

417
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:26,080
acp and the goal to tcp / ip and the goal

418
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,659
is to be online and always online,

419
00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:31,269
always connected and excess history

420
00:27:31,269 --> 00:27:34,119
of this case study,

421
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:38,409
we have here some examples about

422
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:40,479
all the clients with whom we have

423
00:27:40,479 --> 00:27:43,800
worked over the years

424
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,200
here we have an example a system is

425
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,100
every time it is

426
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:53,600
the typical boring interface enough that

427
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,610
we can find deno  Stada but it

428
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:59,600
seems to me that there are other somewhat better in

429
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,789
different parts of the world as you can

430
00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:05,480
see we have here the topology and more or

431
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,289
less it is about this or it used to

432
00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:11,059
be as it is because in this scheme

433
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:13,809
we do not have any type of

434
00:28:13,809 --> 00:28:17,750
device or app or  ipad to

435
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:21,289
act as a manager because the person does not

436
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:24,409
want to walk and move his butt to the

437
00:28:24,409 --> 00:28:26,720
floor he prefers to keep everything in his

438
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,059
own pool from his home to

439
00:28:29,059 --> 00:28:31,100
running for example

440
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,190
we have another view here what happens

441
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:36,650
very often is that the further we

442
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:39,460
go we say  from the offices

443
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,960
where the desk officers work

444
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,510
to the plants to the

445
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:46,220
work area itself and that is where the

446
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,049
companies really do not want us to

447
00:28:48,049 --> 00:28:50,960
arrive and why, why,

448
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,880
if there is an impact, even available because

449
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,440
there are production losses because

450
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,169
we start to start calling  and I no longer

451
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:59,630
have water, electricity, etc.,

452
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:03,200
etc. and of course make an impact

453
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,000
on the price of the shares and on the

454
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,190
stock market  Trade shows the impact and in

455
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:09,169
this fairly simple slide we can

456
00:29:09,169 --> 00:29:12,140
understand the difference in flex, let's say

457
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:15,230
when the small one is made to a bank

458
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:17,659
or when the search is made to a

459
00:29:17,659 --> 00:29:20,000
plant of this type and when I say time

460
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,370
you I mean good to  end of the

461
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:24,500
day who cares if

462
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,390
the bank's website cannot be reached or if it

463
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:30,220
is not available but it is much worse

464
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:34,550
the most critical attacks that

465
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,980
happen selena is indicating to me that

466
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,980
maybe i

467
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:41,799
will talk about the top and the

468
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:46,240
mouth myself  You are from the Italian Stock Exchange

469
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,309
because of a problem with a

470
00:29:48,309 --> 00:29:51,070
three-year supplier, I cannot name it well.The

471
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,960
news is public and how much they lost

472
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,150
if it was a public case, how many lost

473
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:59,120
in two days from October 28 to

474
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,790
30 today  for this fall because

475
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:04,300
some people the bad guys

476
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:08,310
posted on the dark web

477
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,540
some information they

478
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:13,410
said what they pay us 40 million or we

479
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:15,850
posted this information therefore

480
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,950
this is how it happens and why should we

481
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,950
interest this as I said

482
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:22,270
this slide I am not going to read it

483
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:24,100
completely I love the community

484
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,290
but again we want

485
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,480
to participate in this I began to

486
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,820
work in is giving in 2005 to 6 and

487
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:35,200
since 2007 8 I again became a

488
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,210
regret of the  rise as accept them and in

489
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:41,810
fact I remember a talk where I was

490
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:43,810
on stage I

491
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:46,270
was taking gravel and talking about

492
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,250
escada and well it was all over the world and

493
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:51,070
this is because the objective was to

494
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,050
make people think about the

495
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:55,240
problems and in fact

496
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,230
they

497
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,570
will not stop  think about this if you do not send

498
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:01,790
any type of wrong message without

499
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:05,210
promoting anything the

500
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:07,850
absolute must then carry out the

501
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:10,039
training and raise awareness

502
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:12,890
because over the years to how it was dictated

503
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:16,130
and there have already been many incidents and I

504
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:18,529
select only a few that is  I say

505
00:31:18,529 --> 00:31:21,559
that it is more like saying it the most

506
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:24,950
important the greatest and I do not know

507
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:27,230
how many of you remember this

508
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:30,350
incident was in the year 99 with impunity and the United

509
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,860
States and the next with this  and

510
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:36,080
word instrument with fox sports is that the

511
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,700
adolescents did it by foot

512
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:43,139
due to an error

513
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:47,169
a more configured situation as

514
00:31:47,169 --> 00:31:49,210
revealed in the next slides

515
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:53,200
after years the company a company that

516
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,659
owns this plant in fact

517
00:31:55,659 --> 00:31:57,870


518
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:02,580
they realized that  the damage

519
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,740
was approximately 45 million

520
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,500
dollars and this is the photograph and

521
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,990
this whole area so you can see the cursor

522
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:11,880
but this whole area was burned for

523
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,490
sufficient cause it is almost like a park

524
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:17,070
a park where on weekends

525
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,260
families used to go there to  enjoy a

526
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,650
picnic or something play sports to play with

527
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:25,230
your sons and daughters it was destroyed and

528
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:27,440
what happened well let's see here

529
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,420
a more detailed view because it is a

530
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:33,150
dream this good happened simply

531
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:35,540
because

532
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,220
like some software or a bad

533
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,720
configuration good the report  It is

534
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,480
public but when we talked about

535
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,929
this

536
00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:50,190
there were two errors regarding green as

537
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:53,190
well and it seems to me that if it is what it

538
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,930
says here

539
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:57,690
and this is an ext  Rct of the report says

540
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:59,790
if the supervisory control and the

541
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:03,440
status system had been guys

542
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,140
kept responding to the control commands they

543
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,450
probably could have

544
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:13,560
started actions to prevent the

545
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,710
pressure increase that caused the

546
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,870
pipe to rupture now I don't know if it is a

547
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:21,960
Software issue there are people saying that this no

548
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,870
longer exists and well it really is

549
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,540
crazy

550
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:30,920
in the same way this comes from more than

551
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,770
the guide has been indexed in August

552
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:38,800
2003 is key infected a private network and

553
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,240
disabled security monitoring

554
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,550
for almost 5  hours in a nuclear plant and

555
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,560
this is crazy we have to learn

556
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,080
from history we must learn from these

557
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,360
very small and stupid incidents and

558
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,640
we must learn to patch this type of

559
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,850
thing today we have here another view that

560
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:57,020
tells us what I want to

561
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,960
convey to you again  most

562
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,170
people who do this know

563
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:07,580
a pac on some

564
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:11,630
scale system is enough when we talk about pinging

565
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:14,600
the controller  He simply goes

566
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,830
crazy which means that he

567
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:22,909
would have been there, she would

568
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:25,100
have been severely affected as

569
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,900
president, a madness and here we have the

570
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:31,159
pro case regarding the employees and

571
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:34,580
this person was registered and the

572
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:38,260
empire all because

573
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:41,230
when the person was alive  of the

574
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:43,480
company they forgot or people

575
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,060
detained someone forgot to

576
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,168
disable the account of the person who

577
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,360
was fired which was a very

578
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,310
stupid mistake basically to make a

579
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:54,250
basic mistake we also have a history of

580
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:56,860
here we have a historical issue and if

581
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:59,680
there have been changes  in the official report of

582
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,020
the Russians but it is already theory at the

583
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,210
time in the 82 pardon a

584
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:07,030
three button explosion was the result of

585
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:09,650
what appears to be

586
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:13,520
a change in the software in the

587
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,250
software code and the pink government at that

588
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:19,850
time was  I was doing the

589
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:22,640
recent services of the company so

590
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,280
we have here castán an incident

591
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,720
in 2004 in Russia and they billed

592
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,900
the gas distribution company d  the bus

593
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,369
so we are talking about millions of

594
00:35:34,369 --> 00:35:38,740
millions per house of a trojan horse

595
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:44,640
here others more this is known as the

596
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,910
attack of the zombies in texas where

597
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,100
men were second to the

598
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,190
electronic panels of the roads and

599
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:56,190
we also have a topic of pornography in the

600
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:58,350
2000 another and nine a very

601
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:01,740
intelligent person made me laugh they looted

602
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,420
the giant screen at the superbowl and

603
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:07,440
put a pornography image in the

604
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,650
middle of the game and the purchasing company

605
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:14,420
actually put the customer back

606
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,599
with an amount of money with a

607
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,670
credit of  10 dollars to the clients

608
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,859
who saw it and well it seems to me that

609
00:36:21,859 --> 00:36:24,410
we already have enough examples that give us

610
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:26,720
a general idea about the

611
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,299
incidents that happen and of course it

612
00:36:29,299 --> 00:36:33,140
has to do with crime and has to

613
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:37,010
do with electricity plants that

614
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:39,559
were in ukraine  intervened twice in

615
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:41,390
the Indian Ocean and as you know it is not so

616
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:43,640
hot there so imagine that

617
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,130
you were sitting among those 250

618
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:49,490
thousand people at  fected in the country is without

619
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:52,130
electricity in the middle of winter in

620
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:53,329


621
00:36:53,329 --> 00:36:56,690
ukraine we are not in session well why does this happen

622
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:59,660
we have a commission here and I love it

623
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:04,700
because even when security and

624
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,670
scale are there and they are under the same

625
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:10,819
security umbrella apparently but

626
00:37:10,819 --> 00:37:12,520
its  The way of thinking is

627
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,200
different again so they do not understand each

628
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,260
other, it is how they are being a pen testing

629
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:21,230
and it does it without an audit or you want to

630
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,760
do other types of activities or

631
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,829
you try to talk to lawyers it always

632
00:37:24,829 --> 00:37:26,150
has to do with security but it

633
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:28,700
really is difficult to  be understood

634
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:32,450
because even the same terminology the

635
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,059
same words mean something else and

636
00:37:35,059 --> 00:37:36,829
this brings me to the next

637
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:40,869
positive of the cia

638
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:45,920
these data must be confidential and

639
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,880
must be available so if

640
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,560
we think about scale we must first

641
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:56,770
send the energy bill and the

642
00:37:56,770 --> 00:38:00,700
client does not  You may be able to modify

643
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:04,630
the electricity bills or have more

644
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:07,700
kilobytes than what you

645
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,820
are paying for then  s it is possible that they

646
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:14,560
understand why this has to do with

647
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:19,010
gods and also with the city so

648
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:22,330
this is clear because this is quite

649
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:26,210
difficult to be able to speak and

650
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:29,300
can probably be confused then then

651
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,610
we have the errors after so

652
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:34,940
long I understood that the

653
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:38,060
sword suppliers  They like that they do not

654
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:41,150
care much about the security of the

655
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:43,010
information

656
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:47,510
neither did they care much and it is not

657
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:51,680
the dlc

658
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,210
because there was a defect that gives them

659
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:59,040
exact that it was defective so

660
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,920
they did not make jokes about the

661
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,119
following issues that did not have

662
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:07,780
authentication or that too  There was

663
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:12,330
no encryption of the local data,

664
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:15,580
so the registry of things that they

665
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,619
really cannot understand on the cpu

666
00:39:17,619 --> 00:39:23,080
was also quite poor etc but it

667
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,690
will change a bit stable but when

668
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:27,820
one tries to

669
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:31,320
festers and has to believe me and try to

670
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,490
explain this to  excavated providers

671
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:35,890
many times said look you

672
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:40,330
know this is not a vague this is not a

673
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:42,640
limitation these are new  These

674
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:47,190
needs, so we have to

675
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:50,640
get used to it, then he

676
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,770
usually the error is that

677
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:59,540
many times the network

678
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,700
they the truth is that they do not have a good

679
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,010
control and I am going to talk about all

680
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:07,550
the points

681
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:12,890
myself, many times these external

682
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:18,850
ones were not complete when they were and

683
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:22,070
each  Once we had where the truth is

684
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,390
that they did not care much I feel it

685
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:26,540
did not work and to summarize and the

686
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,850
key problems we had

687
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:31,250
technical and economic problems and other new ones

688
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:33,980
some examples

689
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:40,120
believe it or not it is rare to find here an

690
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:44,360
American of scale and also this

691
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,660
can be easy for  but this

692
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:50,750
is similar to be able to refinance this

693
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:53,990
every time one to solvents it turns out that

694
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:58,899
the reaction of the elements is

695
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:04,589
not right and they will change we should

696
00:41:04,589 --> 00:41:10,109
have a house to see but many times we

697
00:41:10,109 --> 00:41:12,750
cannot stop a power plant

698
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:15,900
just for ethical hackers to

699
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:20,099
play with it  and then also in the

700
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:22,589
garden it is not something that they tend well

701
00:41:22,589 --> 00:41:27,290
because it does not have to be er  Rores

702
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:33,230
and the new one we have new problems

703
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:37,980
and protocols and we also have new

704
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:42,410
accesses in terms of the management

705
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:48,360
nc and well the tablet that is what

706
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,430
summons us today we have a

707
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,960
domino effect because it

708
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:58,210
is okay we had worms and botnets and

709
00:41:58,210 --> 00:42:00,760
many times we send as  this was

710
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:04,050
falling piece by piece

711
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:10,550
and many times in some content in

712
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:12,560
some countries so now we are going to the

713
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,600
point this is the case study we have

714
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,330
half an hour left so then we are going

715
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:22,000
to questions is selena

716
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,930
this is an automation company

717
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,900
here we have some images of  the

718
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,490
location is back is back so

719
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:37,210
these people had the part of the

720
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:40,540
pipes etc. etc. but it

721
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:43,030
is also called why

722
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:46,110
they do not understand when something does not work well

723
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:50,290
our escada assets do not make sure

724
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:54,190
they are not receiving more traffic deliveries are made

725
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:57,150
if there is not  billing the

726
00:42:57,150 --> 00:43:01,090
priority the truth was that stuart

727
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:03,790
would not have to do like the clients

728
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:06,310
so we started with some

729
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:10,240
interviews and  celinda chord of her face

730
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,590
said when a manager in some

731
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:16,690
very funny ways said look, you know that the

732
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:20,260
question was how do you leave your plant

733
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,720
is every time

734
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,340
this was part of all this because she

735
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,660
said look

736
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:32,590
with her ipad it was a tablet I don't

737
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:35,590
remember she said I occupy  this and this is a

738
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:38,220
super good

739
00:43:38,369 --> 00:43:41,140
application that I took from general

740
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,900
electric and at that moment what we

741
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:47,279
are telling you is that

742
00:43:47,279 --> 00:43:52,130
this was three or four years ago

743
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:55,340
and well we have

744
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:58,240
the acronym

745
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:04,099
this tastes good every time you do

746
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:06,859
a forensic investigation about  of this

747
00:44:06,859 --> 00:44:09,970
but after this case we can

748
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:14,240
tell you, we will see it at the end of the

749
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,220
presentation because we see this

750
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,660
building with our team that

751
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,880
we decided to generate a

752
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,329
methodology where one can put a

753
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:26,390
focus outside on being

754
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:29,860
and being also this

755
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:34,990
other approach pp and  now I am going to give the

756
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:37,720
floor to selena I would also like to

757
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:41,200
add something because one can say look

758
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,430
if first of all we have the issue

759
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:47,410
of confidentiality but also  the

760
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:50,110
availability of the data and I

761
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:54,130
would like to go back a slide I

762
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:57,319
would like to show you

763
00:44:57,319 --> 00:45:01,219
where we can ensure that the others with

764
00:45:01,219 --> 00:45:03,259
what will be being used and that they are

765
00:45:03,259 --> 00:45:04,940
used for the scaling systems

766
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:07,209
all these protocols

767
00:45:07,209 --> 00:45:09,589
are unfortunately very insecure and

768
00:45:09,589 --> 00:45:12,199
this is also because we show

769
00:45:12,199 --> 00:45:15,559
At the beginning of the aqmi video that is good

770
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:17,599
because when we have something that is

771
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,829
public and that is insecure it is a problem

772
00:45:21,829 --> 00:45:26,349
because we need to

773
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:30,390
have this type of environment that is not

774
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:33,960
secure and put it in another way than if it was

775
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,510
ensured so it is that we cannot change

776
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:39,390
the protocols  Unfortunately, but

777
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:41,660
if we must put this type of

778
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:44,700
infrastructure and that force, again

779
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,849
we have also seen that

780
00:45:48,849 --> 00:45:54,130
in the attack in Ukraine there is also an

781
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:59,220
engineer and a video but which I,

782
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:05,030
the computer where all

783
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:08,500
the infrastructure was downloaded, was not

784
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,970
connected to the internet and the  engineer what

785
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:14,180
he was doing he saw that the mouse moved without

786
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:17,690
touching it then first of all there

787
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:19,760
is  You have kinds of problems and that is why we

788
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,760
started with the acme that were to be

789
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:25,870
able to understand that all these types of

790
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:28,390
vulnerabilities are unfortunately public

791
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:30,940


792
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:33,329
and what we have found is that

793
00:46:33,329 --> 00:46:36,180
we started in advance

794
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,069
we started with this type of

795
00:46:38,069 --> 00:46:42,220
investigation and we started with certain

796
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:46,630
information that  we have found in the

797
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:48,910
cti with intelligence fever in we

798
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:51,400
found it in the afternoon web we have a

799
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,119
protocol that the

800
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:56,890
client

801
00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:59,440
was using was affected and not only in the tips

802
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:04,000
but also with other systems

803
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,880
for example from here

804
00:47:10,779 --> 00:47:14,540
your was quite shocking

805
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:18,500
we are also talking about the  present and

806
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:21,620
with this a workshop could be run,

807
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:25,120
we have also found other types of

808
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:28,160
vulnerabilities and of course we know

809
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,890
that in turning around we will find

810
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:34,790
here the traces that it attacks on a

811
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:37,730
scale and especially with

812
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:40,940
copper and we have realized that there are many

813
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:44,470
scale plant attacks

814
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:48,580
and it can be very dangerous and many times

815
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:52,210
we also saw it in  the past in some

816
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:54,010
countries around the world that there are

817
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:58,510
many victims and after these

818
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:03,369
attacks from here or so this is one of

819
00:48:03,369 --> 00:48:08,920
the samples of the tablet presscada art and

820
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,260
when we saw it accepts tablet of what we

821
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:15,700
were there to be able to manage a

822
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,980
part of the infrastructure  scale and

823
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:21,520
we are shocked because not only

824
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,410
for the scale infrastructure but

825
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:26,050
there is also someone to think about

826
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:28,750
the water pipes and water pumps

827
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:31,090
that can be managed through

828
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:33,849
a tablet what we discovered in this

829
00:48:33,849 --> 00:48:37,480
case that of course we discovered  that in

830
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:41,830
other times of the differences in

831
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:43,930
mobile phones that this is also affected

832
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:46,000
by a Trojan

833
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,330
and through a telephone and through the

834
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:52,810
forensic system we realized that there

835
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:56,560
were cards that we had these

836
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:59,930
mobile attacks that compromised the

837
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:03,740
mobile phone and began to execute it on

838
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:06,950
the woman  of because of course

839
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:10,280
we also had all the credentials, there were

840
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,980
teams committed to the

841
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:16,090
credentials and everything was  compromised

842
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:21,160
so we discovered and told

843
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:26,420
the administration that you

844
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:28,490
encountered problems because you

845
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:30,890
realize that there was a problem but

846
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:33,470
when we went and did the

847
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,930
analysis of the problem

848
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:37,520
we realized that this program

849
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:41,090
problem forgiveness was even greater than what

850
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:45,370
the client imagined  then thanks

851
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:47,319
then cyber intelligence issues

852
00:49:47,319 --> 00:49:48,880
I finish we realized that there was a

853
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:53,230
problem and also big thanks to the 7

854
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:54,819
plus French on their mobiles because they

855
00:49:54,819 --> 00:49:56,349
said look

856
00:49:56,349 --> 00:50:00,700
don't worry we don't care about the

857
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,289
difference part of the mobiles but of

858
00:50:02,289 --> 00:50:06,249
course we can call the police

859
00:50:06,249 --> 00:50:08,890
but especially  Because of these attacks they

860
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:12,910
are using also we cannot

861
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:17,859
use the normal forensic lines when

862
00:50:17,859 --> 00:50:20,499
we have this digital frank to follow and the

863
00:50:20,499 --> 00:50:24,039
cti falls in love with what we discovered and what

864
00:50:24,039 --> 00:50:27,130
we started to do go include in

865
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:29,079
our conference is that today

866
00:50:29,079 --> 00:50:32,670
we have different types of

867
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:36,130
cyber forensic analysis  intelligence and

868
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:39,400
data analysis we discover by axis  But

869
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:43,329
also to do a proactive way such

870
00:50:43,329 --> 00:50:45,759
as fan testing and have the evidence

871
00:50:45,759 --> 00:50:49,470
then one attractive and the other that post

872
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:51,320
incident

873
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,540
and we realized that many times

874
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:58,540
some companies decide not to execute

875
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:00,860
reproduced systems in front of it because it takes a

876
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:02,900
long time of course but the

877
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,790
reality is  which were also very

878
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:06,800
interesting

879
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,170
to be able to make a difference in

880
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:12,740
scale because also in all these

881
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:15,620
systems it was also very interesting

882
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:18,010
because the escada environments were

883
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:21,530
made up of different items and

884
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:24,500
different objectives and when analyzing

885
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:28,660
through the network we realized that

886
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:31,520
this

887
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:35,750
also  Professors were part of this, it is

888
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:38,090
part of a problem that we

889
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:40,910
also find in scale environments

890
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:43,850
because many times we have the

891
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:47,470
vulnerability of the data and it is they must

892
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:50,070
execute

893
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:53,240
of course

894
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,970
they have to see the

895
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:58,750
water pumps to generate energy and

896
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:01,910
they are not

897
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:06,020
there.  vulnerability because for them it is

898
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:10,069
very critical as well and many of these

899
00:52:10,069 --> 00:52:13,400
prove  Also in all of our

900
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,069
critical infrastructure that we have seen

901
00:52:16,069 --> 00:52:19,250
they cannot find it because they

902
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:24,590
do not know how the system is going to work

903
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:27,050
and well that is also what happens with

904
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:28,700
the providers this is what we were

905
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:32,600
saying from here we must balance the

906
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,510
contracts, conferences and everything  and

907
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:38,630
also have the safety of human beings

908
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:40,720
,

909
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,618
good

910
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:48,329
and we can see the different systems of

911
00:52:48,329 --> 00:52:49,440
charging what we have found

912
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:56,960
exactly is through mobile phones and

913
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:01,000
once we have seen

914
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,560
a little, many times

915
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:09,180
the analysis of a malware is that many

916
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:12,690
times one does not  You can manage this, there are

917
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:15,570
many times the attackers do not know

918
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:18,870
how it works because each of the

919
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:21,930
environments is each different so

920
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:27,630
with this we can work well what

921
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:33,280
we have decided to do we begin

922
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:40,150
to have the different types that we can

923
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:41,800
trace through

924
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:46,480
strong systems  is and what we discover from the

925
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,750
digital phrase of this item is that

926
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:52,770
we can produce

927
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:56,320
This also generates an analysis

928
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:59,080
of threat intelligence and we have already

929
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:02,320
started at this point we have started

930
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:05,440
with this type of methodologies

931
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:10,420
and we have been able to apply it to the study of

932
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:15,310
this case, on the other hand the

933
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:20,300
intelligence analyst has found that

934
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:25,140
information is compiled from this efe so  So much

935
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:27,390
so that it seems to me that it is formally that we can

936
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:29,520
start as it is so long with

937
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,339
terminology quite occurred at the

938
00:54:32,339 --> 00:54:35,190
beginning but we also do not know who it

939
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:37,400
is in our audience today

940
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,950
we hoped that they enjoyed it and they

941
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:43,230
hacked remember it because we have to

942
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:46,530
promote this verb and all the

943
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:48,180
infrastructure  that we have at the

944
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:51,950
moment all these protocols

945
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:54,630
are unsafe,

946
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:58,500
so I would like the new if they are to

947
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,440
become

948
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,900
said that this is also much more

949
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,390
secure and we need a new

950
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:10,200
generation to make a decision today in the

951
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:13,710
area of scale to be able to consider

952
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:16,260
this  in a different way because so that

953
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:19,410
a tent does not happen that they a lot of  more

954
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:21,690
thanks and I hope we have some

955
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:23,850
questions

956
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:28,440
thank you very much raúl for the presentation it

957
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:31,069
has been very interesting to

958
00:55:31,069 --> 00:55:34,140
hear from you about the great

959
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:36,140
differences that when we talk about

960
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:39,660
safety and also second in scale

961
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:41,609
especially when we have a

962
00:55:41,609 --> 00:55:45,180
nuclear plant that cannot have a secondary staying

963
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:47,240


964
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,369
and  I can tell you a story about

965
00:55:49,369 --> 00:55:51,860
the nuclear plant because it is public but

966
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:54,590
I also learn because in an

967
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:57,400
interview with

968
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:01,450
Julian Assange a couple of years ago a

969
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:06,150
journalist went to interview Assange

970
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:08,830
well we know who you are like

971
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:11,230
Irina Shayk but how did you become Julian

972
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:13,420
Assange  So what you want to tell

973
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:17,410
now, you also linked it with our

974
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:21,010
previous chat with the other person from the United

975
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:23,320
States that I do not remember the man with the

976
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:25,330
big beard,

977
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:27,940
Jacques because one of the books that I

978
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:30,820
have loved to bring you here because I

979
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:33,910
love stories and also these

980
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:36,340
stories  of real life is that also

981
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:39,849
from the 90s ahead in Australia it

982
00:56:39,849 --> 00:56:43,690
was a refuge  And the first book is

983
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:48,930
that the author explained how in the 90s in

984
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:51,489
Australia, Europe and North

985
00:56:51,489 --> 00:56:54,809
South America, we held

986
00:56:54,809 --> 00:56:58,230
conferences in bionics

987
00:56:58,230 --> 00:57:01,910
to be able to also identify Pegasus,

988
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:05,369
you are the first chats and why it

989
00:57:05,369 --> 00:57:07,230
costs them their story because this

990
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:10,530
journalist if I do not speak  with julian

991
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:14,730
assange and he told you already assange and

992
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:17,010
we know the whole story but how he

993
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:20,490
became julian assange so

994
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:25,950
well this was in australia and well the

995
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:30,300
book and the author decided to release it so

996
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:31,980
it is a book that is the

997
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:34,950
author's book julian assange  Then

998
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:37,830
Julian answered well, you know it

999
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:42,140
was never necessary to forget that a couple of nights

1000
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:45,630
where he was hacking a

1001
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:49,310
nuclear plant in France and he was chatting, he

1002
00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:53,480
was chatting with

1003
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:57,430
a person from Italy,

1004
00:57:57,430 --> 00:58:01,490
many are that I do not remember what it was

1005
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:04,790
like that but he only remembered him

1006
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:07,330
worthy

1007
00:58:07,569 --> 00:58:12,300
then  I was trying

1008
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:15,270
and hacking this plant because that

1009
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:18,510
story changed because now that I am

1010
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:20,850
almost 50 years old when I was a

1011
00:58:20,850 --> 00:58:23,820
fifteen-year-old was fun but now if

1012
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:26,480
I think about it I

1013
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:31,830
was a hacker a teenager and I wanted to

1014
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:35,010
agree a money not to create this is

1015
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:39,500
crazy it was simply crazy

1016
00:58:41,970 --> 00:58:45,250
now also when we think about what

1017
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:48,570
knowledge can provide us and is

1018
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:51,820
appropriate in a first stage of your life

1019
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:56,770
where we also have here a world

1020
00:58:56,770 --> 00:59:00,160
made of many rocks of rocks or a wall

1021
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,920
made with many windows then I am going to

1022
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:05,430
talk about

1023
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:10,619
other legislative tasks the wache

1024
00:59:10,619 --> 00:59:14,020
graduated from the presentation xxi linear

1025
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:16,530
broadway the hard

1026
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:21,609
station mother later although this

1027
00:59:21,609 --> 00:59:24,060
question is

1028
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,400


1029
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:32,340
probably good conversation with your Italian

1030
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:34,820
You can understand a little more but I want to

1031
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:37,980
ask the questions in English and then I

1032
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:40,890
can translate it into Spanish so that

1033
00:59:40,890 --> 00:59:43,230
we can continue with our conversation

1034
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:47,369
the first question for Raúl

1035
00:59:47,369 --> 00:59:52,430
Bueno you mentioned about

1036
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:56,919
at the beginning of a few years ago

1037
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:01,730
what do you think is the main

1038
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:06,170
difference  in making an x of 25 or making

1039
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:07,210
these changes'

1040
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:10,970
public telephones and it is every no  It is like

1041
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:15,110
something similar in a certain way if on the one

1042
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:17,990
hand it is and on the other hand it is not

1043
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:21,260
because it has also taken a long

1044
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:24,800
time because we did not have internet it is not

1045
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:28,610
like we were able to create

1046
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:31,850
this we had to list them

1047
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:37,930
manually no  there were manuals

1048
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:41,839
we also had the linex show that at the

1049
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:44,510
beginning was quite deficient

1050
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:47,480
elite internet either then i

1051
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:51,890
would say that is thought it was also a

1052
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:55,210
very small group

1053
01:00:56,250 --> 01:01:00,960
it could also hack we had other

1054
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,450
friends from new york and then our

1055
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:04,080
friends

1056
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:08,880
even though they were we were little

1057
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,920
we had  15 or 20 years so

1058
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,800
question number 2 is that I had not been

1059
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:17,190
involved I have a friend on the set

1060
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:20,490
Australians said look, you know that a

1061
01:01:20,490 --> 01:01:23,910
while ago he told us that he said something to me

1062
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:26,350
the day

1063
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:33,490
the money departs from marin is

1064
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:35,660
going to be

1065
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:36,950
[Music]

1066
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:41,060
the first is going to end because all this

1067
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:43,820
after the money then even since he was

1068
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:46,150
probably

1069
01:01:46,930 --> 01:01:48,640
trying his

1070
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:51,250
best to have his machine

1071
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:54,160
f  unctioning but every time we did

1072
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:57,880
something that was out of curiosity and

1073
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:02,010
also 90% of the time

1074
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:05,770
and one told the administrator

1075
01:02:05,770 --> 01:02:09,010
about the findings that he had but it

1076
01:02:09,010 --> 01:02:13,680
was also something different, it was another stage

1077
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:19,970
and well it seems to me that there has also been

1078
01:02:19,970 --> 01:02:24,800
a certain  Maturity in terms of how

1079
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:29,300
the impact and industrialization and

1080
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:31,550
finances of our climate or hacking is

1081
01:02:31,550 --> 01:02:34,760
no longer the same and that is why we

1082
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:38,920
must establish certain differences

1083
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:44,410
and probably about shilin ln

1084
01:02:44,410 --> 01:02:48,359
why it will consist

1085
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:50,730
is that we have even young problems

1086
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:52,470
every  because it is the fact that we are

1087
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:53,549
isolated

1088
01:02:53,549 --> 01:02:58,670
the lack of patches or because there are no

1089
01:02:58,670 --> 01:03:01,799
commercial incentives to keep the

1090
01:03:01,799 --> 01:03:05,099
infrastructures working that would be

1091
01:03:05,099 --> 01:03:07,730
the problem

1092
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:11,310
if it is a good question in the first place

1093
01:03:11,310 --> 01:03:14,280
of course and also in

1094
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:17,190
old protocols that are being used

1095
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:20,640
therefore  there are many factors and many

1096
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,839
problems therefore I would not like to

1097
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:26,910
focus only on one problem of

1098
01:03:26,910 --> 01:03:30,980
course on many issues  It is

1099
01:03:31,150 --> 01:03:35,180
because there is no security by design

1100
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:37,220
of course and there is also new

1101
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:40,190
production and then and time the new

1102
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:44,000
object that is produced in production

1103
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,850
has no security at all

1104
01:03:46,850 --> 01:03:50,680
therefore I think that at this moment

1105
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:56,090
when I saw many talks

1106
01:03:56,090 --> 01:03:59,240
regarding  climbing I thought if it would be good it

1107
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:02,450
could be good as you said

1108
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:05,390
with regard to security to be able to isolate

1109
01:04:05,390 --> 01:04:08,690
a piece of course but the core the

1110
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:10,490
core has no security at

1111
01:04:10,490 --> 01:04:14,600
all but when we know that something

1112
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:17,570
is connected to the internet then it

1113
01:04:17,570 --> 01:04:20,150
makes the situation worse specifically

1114
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:24,350
Now we have seen a growth in the

1115
01:04:24,350 --> 01:04:26,180
development of apps when we talk about the

1116
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:28,970
internet of things

1117
01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:32,520
so now we must also

1118
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:35,040
manage billings as well other pieces

1119
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:38,100
of the escada infrastructure

1120
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:43,670
therefore I know that for everyone and that this is

1121
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:47,580
a nightmare to protect the entire

1122
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:50,840
Escada plant but I think it is

1123
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:55,950
and the most important thing is to be able to run

1124
01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:59,940
with a serious company dependent  nde to espn the

1125
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:04,280
fence of the most commented area enter the

1126
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:08,270
compartment in each different type of

1127
01:05:08,270 --> 01:05:10,640
tests

1128
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:14,890
but it is also interesting to see the

1129
01:05:14,890 --> 01:05:18,500
exponent part if someone manages to hack an

1130
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:22,190
object in a power plant what kind

1131
01:05:22,190 --> 01:05:25,220
of information can be found

1132
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:27,800
thank you very much I have a question  follow-

1133
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:30,770
up with respect to the

1134
01:05:30,770 --> 01:05:34,099
previous question and I will say it in Spanish

1135
01:05:34,099 --> 01:05:38,410
first and later in the

1136
01:05:43,470 --> 01:05:46,470
2

1137
01:05:48,599 --> 01:05:52,450
gates on shore anticrisis or rompa but

1138
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:54,500
between tease

1139
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:57,980
and now in English from your work

1140
01:05:57,980 --> 01:06:03,560
what you have known in your experience you have

1141
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:08,660
done a  analysis puts this in

1142
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:13,470
scale environments and when all these attacks

1143
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:16,140
you have found that these attacks

1144
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:18,420
sponsored by a

1145
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:21,339
state organization or by professionals

1146
01:06:21,339 --> 01:06:24,099
good in this type of environment actually

1147
01:06:24,099 --> 01:06:26,380
in many

1148
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:30,369
state sponsored attacks of course well we see more

1149
01:06:30,369 --> 01:06:33,670
activity from the world of cyberattacks

1150
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:35,349
and  also from other competitors

1151
01:06:35,349 --> 01:06:40,150
therefore these types of the present not

1152
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:43,599
only of course for  damage

1153
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:47,289
infrastructures there are also attacks to be

1154
01:06:47,289 --> 01:06:50,109
sponsored to steal in question also

1155
01:06:50,109 --> 01:06:52,569
since these are related to cyber

1156
01:06:52,569 --> 01:06:56,049
espionage, therefore these are these types of

1157
01:06:56,049 --> 01:06:58,650
situations that we have,

1158
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:00,930
especially

1159
01:07:00,930 --> 01:07:03,599
in the last two or three years

1160
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:06,089
there has been a lot of activity regarding

1161
01:07:06,089 --> 01:07:08,460
these factors

1162
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:10,380
there is some  vertical that the industry in

1163
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:11,950


1164
01:07:11,950 --> 01:07:14,940
particular energy and oil and gas, I would

1165
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:18,570
say basic services, although they go to me

1166
01:07:18,570 --> 01:07:22,099
in general in all places, yes it

1167
01:07:22,099 --> 01:07:25,819
is a client that delivers water to two

1168
01:07:25,819 --> 01:07:28,579
different states but in one state it

1169
01:07:28,579 --> 01:07:31,069
is within the city of Ronda and

1170
01:07:31,069 --> 01:07:34,519
So much water would be decent to the pope and the

1171
01:07:34,519 --> 01:07:37,039
Vatican so when we talk about

1172
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:39,109
this they talk to us so that

1173
01:07:39,109 --> 01:07:42,369
we can evaluate whether the sensors,

1174
01:07:42,369 --> 01:07:45,229
although poisoning, could be

1175
01:07:45,229 --> 01:07:48,920
created and in a certain way manipulated

1176
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:51,079
to manipulate the data and the truth is

1177
01:07:51,079 --> 01:07:52,640
that the answer is yes  so

1178
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:55,670
again it is something that are scary because

1179
01:07:55,670 --> 01:07:57,289
they are already saying good when

1180
01:07:57,289 --> 01:07:59,809
a bank is activated here not imp  Orta the bank

1181
01:07:59,809 --> 01:08:01,670
discovered by insurance has to do

1182
01:08:01,670 --> 01:08:03,739
only with money and we are talking

1183
01:08:03,739 --> 01:08:06,440
about bits and nothing else but when

1184
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:08,359
we talk about a person when

1185
01:08:08,359 --> 01:08:11,180
we talk about basic services in impact

1186
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:13,970
it has to do with human lives and that is

1187
01:08:13,970 --> 01:08:17,779
when it is problematic

1188
01:08:17,779 --> 01:08:20,929
good  They would like one about the

1189
01:08:20,929 --> 01:08:23,509
banks specifically the 90s at the end

1190
01:08:23,509 --> 01:08:25,250
of this question session but they

1191
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:29,389
wanted things to ask you to

1192
01:08:29,389 --> 01:08:31,009
share for the audience that they

1193
01:08:31,009 --> 01:08:33,460
work for

1194
01:08:34,149 --> 01:08:37,229
and I will repeat it later in Spanish

1195
01:08:37,229 --> 01:08:40,779
the one that is most commonly found of

1196
01:08:40,779 --> 01:08:43,270
this type of thing was  The open fret on

1197
01:08:43,270 --> 01:08:46,210
especially this here that you have

1198
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:47,259
this question well but this expression

1199
01:08:47,259 --> 01:08:51,640
works your security and they would like to pass

1200
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:55,448
if perhaps to the world of

1201
01:08:55,448 --> 01:08:58,000
industrial analysis for things and if you give me a

1202
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,560
second it puts it in Spanish

1203
01:09:08,109 --> 01:09:12,500
and the interest and importance of living in

1204
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:15,410
world in the  cultivation of the monthly indicator we

1205
01:09:15,410 --> 01:09:17,769


1206
01:09:18,490 --> 01:09:22,220
demonstrate externalization of the world in

1207
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:24,988
truth

1208
01:09:24,988 --> 01:09:28,380
I would say that common mistakes are

1209
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:30,509
basically a ma  the configuration and it

1210
01:09:30,509 --> 01:09:32,099
is not something that I can tell you

1211
01:09:32,099 --> 01:09:34,799
but everyone knows 90% a

1212
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:39,319
ransomware that is received through a

1213
01:09:39,319 --> 01:09:44,549
clean opel or think of it in the

1214
01:09:44,549 --> 01:09:46,859
broadest sense of the word the concept and

1215
01:09:46,859 --> 01:09:50,069
the  Second point is that when there

1216
01:09:50,069 --> 01:09:53,099
are publications, they are written or

1217
01:09:53,099 --> 01:09:56,280
written incorrectly, therefore,

1218
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:59,849
the feet are not known with respect to the

1219
01:09:59,849 --> 01:10:01,349
security coding in the

1220
01:10:01,349 --> 01:10:04,019
security prevention and of course

1221
01:10:04,019 --> 01:10:05,880
the point number 3 as we have

1222
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:08,699
also seen it in the studies  of case they

1223
01:10:08,699 --> 01:10:12,230
have to do with human food

1224
01:10:13,230 --> 01:10:18,400
and also a mix history of the

1225
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,590
data applications that can be told

1226
01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:21,840
in the

1227
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,210
dark web and also

1228
01:10:25,210 --> 01:10:27,250
a topic with the credentials of the

1229
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:29,530
staff and 16 3 are the main

1230
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:32,010
things that we see the current main ones

1231
01:10:32,010 --> 01:10:34,840
is how to get on  in a plane and return in

1232
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:39,810
the year 95 if such is the case

1233
01:10:41,620 --> 01:10:43,960
and with respect to that point it will return in

1234
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:46,120
the time

1235
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:49,900
that we could apply then

1236
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:52,000
and before which answer is asked

1237
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,310
in Spanish what could  let's learn from

1238
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:56,920
the last 25 years because we have already

1239
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:59,260
dealt with these problems we have already

1240
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:01,780
dealt with the paper bear if we have

1241
01:11:01,780 --> 01:11:06,180
dealt with that we do not have the sad one

1242
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:08,580
because we have a series of problems

1243
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:11,550
that we all already know what the

1244
01:11:11,550 --> 01:11:13,920
inferences of both would be for those

1245
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,540
people  that they are giving at this time

1246
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:18,240
so that they can learn to start

1247
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:22,080
applying this to their relationships with

1248
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:24,870
suppliers then only on their own

1249
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:27,950
side the infrastructure

1250
01:11:35,949 --> 01:11:40,210
and former

1251
01:11:40,810 --> 01:11:43,810
inter-

1252
01:11:45,699 --> 01:11:48,699
disciplines raven

1253
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:01,780
as

1254
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:09,550
what we found 20 years ago and

1255
01:12:09,550 --> 01:12:11,590
it remains the same and obviously we have

1256
01:12:11,590 --> 01:12:14,770
a problem  So it seems to me that in

1257
01:12:14,770 --> 01:12:17,860
none of them at least we are beginning to

1258
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:19,870
understand something, the European Commission is in

1259
01:12:19,870 --> 01:12:22,600
fact pushing and pressing to

1260
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,340
have certainty in the design so

1261
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,290
to answer you I think that the biggest

1262
01:12:26,290 --> 01:12:29,020
problem has to do with the management,

1263
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:31,700
if the suppliers take it.

1264
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:34,340
management regarding who authorizes who

1265
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:35,900
denies authorization what about

1266
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:37,570
money transfers  ro and in my opinion

1267
01:12:37,570 --> 01:12:41,690
until regulation enables us to

1268
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:44,030
change mentality and to change everything

1269
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:45,500


1270
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:49,670
that together we are going to change

1271
01:12:49,670 --> 01:12:53,060
a story has taught me that when

1272
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:55,390
a private company makes a mistake they

1273
01:12:55,390 --> 01:13:02,030
must define and explain it and there must

1274
01:13:02,030 --> 01:13:03,530
be a fine because of  otherwise

1275
01:13:03,530 --> 01:13:05,660
we are simply not interested and others

1276
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:08,360
want to be frank and honest not only

1277
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:11,510
on the issue of suppliers when

1278
01:13:11,510 --> 01:13:13,100
we think about

1279
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:14,900
basic services companies are basically

1280
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:16,940
slaves of their suppliers they cannot

1281
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:19,790
buy for issues of guarantees etc.

1282
01:13:19,790 --> 01:13:23,360
etc. it is not really a  person who

1283
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:26,690
is wrong to me I would love to have a

1284
01:13:26,690 --> 01:13:29,420
more free world where things are

1285
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:31,550
clearer and more transparent on both sides

1286
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:34,850
so if my answer is that you have to

1287
01:13:34,850 --> 01:13:37,219
persecute the management in the right

1288
01:13:37,219 --> 01:13:39,590
style, you should not push because there is no

1289
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:42,050
security by design anymore  We have it

1290
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:45,530
in many houses and it is perfect. This is in

1291
01:13:45,530 --> 01:13:47,929
agreement with you. I think that our

1292
01:13:47,929 --> 01:13:49,840
industry is

1293
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:52,679
hard work and sometimes simple.  Mind you,

1294
01:13:52,679 --> 01:13:57,070
we change the vertical perspective and nothing

1295
01:13:57,070 --> 01:14:00,599
our work is applied in those areas,

1296
01:14:00,599 --> 01:14:04,239
whether they are cards, or energy plants,

1297
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:06,310
or internal things, whatever it is, it

1298
01:14:06,310 --> 01:14:07,480
seems to me that it has to be with the

1299
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:10,210
exhibition, so now changing the

1300
01:14:10,210 --> 01:14:13,810
subject a bit but on the same subject  in

1301
01:14:13,810 --> 01:14:15,270
general

1302
01:14:15,270 --> 01:14:18,090
and today's attacks that happen

1303
01:14:18,090 --> 01:14:20,460
on the internet can attack any

1304
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:23,230
country in the world it

1305
01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:26,860
can be from Argentina Latin America the

1306
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:28,690
truth is that we are not an exception with

1307
01:14:28,690 --> 01:14:32,730
respect to the rest of the world but

1308
01:14:32,730 --> 01:14:37,110
sometimes management or management thinks  that a

1309
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:38,640
given that we are a third world country

1310
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,310
this cannot happen to us we do not need

1311
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:42,930
the same level of security

1312
01:14:42,930 --> 01:14:44,520
compared to a first world country

1313
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:49,590
as it would be your suggestion for those of

1314
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:51,150
always before so that they can understand

1315
01:14:51,150 --> 01:14:53,310
a security impact or more  good

1316
01:14:53,310 --> 01:14:55,860
to understand the impact of not having

1317
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:58,150
security

1318
01:14:58,150 --> 01:15:02,070
and I am going to say it in Spanish

1319
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:07,120
this

1320
01:15:30,490 --> 01:15:34,360
the internet are such positive figures

1321
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:36,400


1322
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:39,530
industrial turban of the secret lake best

1323
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:41,980
gu  Burning

1324
01:15:44,450 --> 01:15:47,320
good those people who look at what has

1325
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:49,880
happened that without happening in Venezuela

1326
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:53,740
there is no electricity

1327
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:59,620
but not because of the revolution

1328
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:03,040
now we do not need these people we

1329
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:05,860
do not need a mandatory popular revolution

1330
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:08,620
for there to be a blackout

1331
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:11,050
but some people like to see well and  I

1332
01:16:11,050 --> 01:16:14,140
can do the job and we

1333
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:16,600
are on the side of the good guys so it

1334
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:19,290


1335
01:16:19,290 --> 01:16:22,110
is really so difficult to

1336
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:25,000
teach someone who does not want to

1337
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,270
understand that he does not want to listen to you and

1338
01:16:28,270 --> 01:16:31,690
does not want to pay attention I think

1339
01:16:31,690 --> 01:16:35,290
that those people you mention do not

1340
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:37,150
need more examples  because we have a

1341
01:16:37,150 --> 01:16:39,310
lot of examples physically they need to

1342
01:16:39,310 --> 01:16:41,470
understand and react to that things

1343
01:16:41,470 --> 01:16:44,320
are changing and on the other hand it is only

1344
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,590
a positive point

1345
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:49,079


1346
01:16:49,079 --> 01:16:52,469
when we think about this and I no

1347
01:16:52,469 --> 01:16:54,059
longer believe that the third world exists the

1348
01:16:54,059 --> 01:16:56,070
truth because the

1349
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:59,070
electric power plants in  sense of chile or rome

1350
01:16:59,070 --> 01:17:02,729
or kiev are the least equal therefore

1351
01:17:02,729 --> 01:17:05,149


1352
01:17:05,310 --> 01:17:08,520
this has allowed us to balance

1353
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:10,950
In a certain way the situation and the

1354
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:14,580
problems and these new problems are

1355
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:16,110
a problem for all of us,

1356
01:17:16,110 --> 01:17:18,450
therefore there should be an approximation or

1357
01:17:18,450 --> 01:17:21,050
a common truth,

1358
01:17:21,050 --> 01:17:23,840
thank you very much, it is a good answer

1359
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:26,389
for that question

1360
01:17:26,389 --> 01:17:29,479
and you mentioned that you are involved

1361
01:17:29,479 --> 01:17:31,789
in a job at the un and  that you have

1362
01:17:31,789 --> 01:17:36,369
worked with different organizations

1363
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,670
and they analyze the problems in the world

1364
01:17:38,670 --> 01:17:41,130
from the problems in

1365
01:17:41,130 --> 01:17:44,370
particular countries what do you think or what

1366
01:17:44,370 --> 01:17:46,350
do you think what is the state of the legislation at

1367
01:17:46,350 --> 01:17:48,219
a time

1368
01:17:48,219 --> 01:17:51,429
with respect to which is the

1369
01:17:51,429 --> 01:17:52,989
current state of the legislation when  We talk

1370
01:17:52,989 --> 01:17:56,129
about this type of attacks

1371
01:18:01,530 --> 01:18:07,290
and

1372
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:13,520
since he was reborn in Ezeiza Canning, he

1373
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:17,449
says reig de Fritz and in a difficult question,

1374
01:18:17,449 --> 01:18:19,730
let me say that in the first place the

1375
01:18:19,730 --> 01:18:21,830
United Nations has an ecosystem that

1376
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:23,780
is so huge that the truth is that we

1377
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:25,820
have no idea because hundreds of agencies

1378
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:29,420
I myself have discovered and every day I continue to

1379
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:31,960
discover a new agency

1380
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:33,930
and there are

1381
01:18:33,930 --> 01:18:36,180
some tenders regarding it but

1382
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:38,220
they are not specific.

1383
01:18:38,220 --> 01:18:40,320
According to what I understand

1384
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:44,130
now, what I think the UN is

1385
01:18:44,130 --> 01:18:46,490
trying to do is solve this type of attacks,

1386
01:18:46,490 --> 01:18:50,720
reduce soften, calm down

1387
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:53,480
the most terrible things with respect to

1388
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:56,470
the city earth because at one point they

1389
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:58,820
thought that a cyberattack was like  an

1390
01:18:58,820 --> 01:19:02,060
act of wanting to say a country aaa aligns itself

1391
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:06,860
with the country sees the country helping the other

1392
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:08,860
country

1393
01:19:08,860 --> 01:19:14,110
is very dangerous but how

1394
01:19:14,340 --> 01:19:19,369
1x main

1395
01:19:19,989 --> 01:19:22,110
as one of the most important people

1396
01:19:22,110 --> 01:19:26,739
in austria said it is impossible to

1397
01:19:26,739 --> 01:19:32,968
attribute a cyberattack in a field

1398
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:40,710
the prime minister  of his own life

1399
01:19:40,710 --> 01:19:45,180
ok it was china it was chile it was such a country

1400
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:47,700
attacked us today and at 11 the other we don't know

1401
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:51,270
could be whoever it could could be a

1402
01:19:51,270 --> 01:19:53,180
person

1403
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:55,310
in any other part of the world who

1404
01:19:55,310 --> 01:19:56,660
is simply sitting in front of his

1405
01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:59,530
computer

1406
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:04,190
and on the other hand I think that  It is

1407
01:20:04,190 --> 01:20:06,290
one of the things that I do not like very much It

1408
01:20:06,290 --> 01:20:08,690
is one of the words that our

1409
01:20:08,690 --> 01:20:10,580
industries always words that come up

1410
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:12,410
every year but there is a word that

1411
01:20:12,410 --> 01:20:15,639
I least like a term

1412
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:17,920
a  Now there is one that I think is called

1413
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,990
the city, which is why we must

1414
01:20:19,990 --> 01:20:23,890
create and deepen the diplomacy of the

1415
01:20:23,890 --> 01:20:27,610
future diplomacy tomorrow with advisers

1416
01:20:27,610 --> 01:20:30,699
now I can teach you that in the

1417
01:20:30,699 --> 01:20:33,219
cyber world things are not so like that they

1418
01:20:33,219 --> 01:20:37,330
are not how

1419
01:20:37,330 --> 01:20:39,699
things work  In the real world, to avoid

1420
01:20:39,699 --> 01:20:44,190
huge errors that could occur

1421
01:20:44,190 --> 01:20:47,330
between different countries,

1422
01:20:47,929 --> 01:20:50,659
I have a question for you at the beginning of

1423
01:20:50,659 --> 01:20:52,530
the talk, so

1424
01:20:52,530 --> 01:20:55,980
we are inviting

1425
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:58,950
women to get involved in

1426
01:20:58,950 --> 01:21:01,980
the security industry and I would like to

1427
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:05,000
invite you please

1428
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:08,240
to tell us, for example tell you  of

1429
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:10,100
our audience for what reason did

1430
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:13,220
the actor commented that he works in sensitivity

1431
01:21:13,220 --> 01:21:16,010
if you enjoy it as low and could

1432
01:21:16,010 --> 01:21:20,650
share those people

1433
01:21:22,469 --> 01:21:25,219
if I did not start with my father

1434
01:21:25,219 --> 01:21:28,249
when I was three years old, every morning I

1435
01:21:28,249 --> 01:21:30,130
had

1436
01:21:30,130 --> 01:21:32,020
a computer that said good morning to me,

1437
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:35,469
excellent and at five years of  age my

1438
01:21:35,469 --> 01:21:38,310
barbie house is my doll house i

1439
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:43,080
was in a computer briefcase

1440
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:46,260
and when i was very young i started  And that is

1441
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:48,969
why I decided to

1442
01:21:48,969 --> 01:21:51,890
get involved in this world too, my

1443
01:21:51,890 --> 01:21:55,460
grandfather was an engineer, therefore I

1444
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:59,870
started with this passion because when I

1445
01:21:59,870 --> 01:22:04,340
was a child to know who knows how to

1446
01:22:04,340 --> 01:22:07,210
open the computer cover

1447
01:22:07,210 --> 01:22:10,210
etc.

1448
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:17,430
I think this is a passion I

1449
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:19,440
think too  It is a hobby and when I go to

1450
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:22,470
give lectures many times I was

1451
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:25,650
the only person the only woman and all

1452
01:22:25,650 --> 01:22:27,900
the people told me this you are in the

1453
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:29,550
legal part no I am not in the

1454
01:22:29,550 --> 01:22:32,800
legal part I know an engineer

1455
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:35,230
and I also want to open cases I want to

1456
01:22:35,230 --> 01:22:36,910
work in the  front part I want to

1457
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:39,430
investigate crimes that have to

1458
01:22:39,430 --> 01:22:43,740
do with cybercrimes

1459
01:22:44,219 --> 01:22:47,010
and it seems to me that it is a passion and

1460
01:22:47,010 --> 01:22:48,510
also throughout the world and when I was in

1461
01:22:48,510 --> 01:22:50,599
Chile

1462
01:22:51,510 --> 01:22:53,610
and in the United States and when I visit

1463
01:22:53,610 --> 01:22:56,500
other conferences around the world

1464
01:22:56,500 --> 01:23:02,080
I meet women [ __ ] and  Those are in

1465
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:05,260
the world of pen testing as in other

1466
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:08,760
tasks and I think

1467
01:23:08,830 --> 01:23:12,270
that girls, women all over the world,

1468
01:23:12,270 --> 01:23:16,010
many times one eye

1469
01:23:16,010 --> 01:23:20,539
are encouraged by their family and by

1470
01:23:20,539 --> 01:23:24,199
society because they say no, this job is

1471
01:23:24,199 --> 01:23:26,659
for men etcetera etcetera but no

1472
01:23:26,659 --> 01:23:29,599
it is not true so this is the reason

1473
01:23:29,599 --> 01:23:32,960
why I started

1474
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:36,800
and now I am also beginning to

1475
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:39,830
find women for the

1476
01:23:39,830 --> 01:23:41,960
cyber world in Italy for this because

1477
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:43,850
we also want to start from

1478
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:47,390
school and I think that at this time

1479
01:23:47,390 --> 01:23:50,390
we also want to illustrate and we want to

1480
01:23:50,390 --> 01:23:53,180
show the youth what we

1481
01:23:53,180 --> 01:23:57,590
do what kind of resources could

1482
01:23:57,590 --> 01:24:00,290
be available to have a better

1483
01:24:00,290 --> 01:24:04,250
place a better world yes perfect

1484
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:06,410
passion really is a very

1485
01:24:06,410 --> 01:24:08,780
good motivating factor and for

1486
01:24:08,780 --> 01:24:11,270
whoever is listening should follow their

1487
01:24:11,270 --> 01:24:12,770
passion

1488
01:24:12,770 --> 01:24:14,930
is really if the key to being

1489
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:18,280
happy with certainty

1490
01:24:18,930 --> 01:24:23,230
and in addition to what can be said céline

1491
01:24:23,230 --> 01:24:25,800
maybe

1492
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:28,020
and this is a question for both ok

1493
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:31,080
maybe there are people who are in the

1494
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:33,180
audience who are probably in their

1495
01:24:33,180 --> 01:24:36,600
first  cybersecurity conference and

1496
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:38,340
you have been a part of the industry

1497
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:40,900
for years

1498
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:43,929
and you assuming this is the first

1499
01:24:43,929 --> 01:24:46,030
time you  a person hears about escalation

1500
01:24:46,030 --> 01:24:48,250
or who hears about

1501
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:50,890
global supply or about

1502
01:24:50,890 --> 01:24:55,070
internet security, how could we

1503
01:24:55,070 --> 01:24:58,630
invite more people to this world

1504
01:24:58,630 --> 01:25:01,960
with these problems,

1505
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:04,600
well in my opinion, starting with

1506
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:08,140
books, there are many books, there

1507
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:11,860
are romance novels, there are books.  historical but they

1508
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:13,780
are not only for people who are more

1509
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:16,140
expert in the technical point and

1510
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:18,969
I also go back to what you said I remember

1511
01:25:18,969 --> 01:25:22,450
when we could fly and travel

1512
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:25,660
I do not know maybe it is necessary to do it again

1513
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:28,330
in the hearing and there was a

1514
01:25:28,330 --> 01:25:30,670
security person  that it was like you like me or they

1515
01:25:30,670 --> 01:25:32,850
improve

1516
01:25:32,850 --> 01:25:36,750
we should be less the majority of

1517
01:25:36,750 --> 01:25:39,060
the audience must be those people

1518
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:42,360
who are arriving there and who do not believe in

1519
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:43,800
the world of the safety of

1520
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:46,070
new people who are not participating I

1521
01:25:46,070 --> 01:25:48,210
would like to see for example

1522
01:25:48,210 --> 01:25:51,720
marketing managers me  I would like to see for example

1523
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:55,260
the members of the board who sometimes

1524
01:25:55,260 --> 01:25:57,120
have no idea what happens with

1525
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:01,110
security as I for example I gave  the

1526
01:26:01,110 --> 01:26:03,330
first talk the 96 conference and

1527
01:26:03,330 --> 01:26:06,660
now it is 2020 and well

1528
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:08,250
online but it is still something that

1529
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:10,230
excites me but please it has been many

1530
01:26:10,230 --> 01:26:12,660
years in which we continue saying the

1531
01:26:12,660 --> 01:26:14,730
same things and things do not change

1532
01:26:14,730 --> 01:26:16,080
so probably our audience

1533
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:19,200
has something  wrong and if it is easy to

1534
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:21,600
talk about security to the security club it

1535
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:25,790
is true that it

1536
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:28,659
would be a good joke but it

1537
01:26:28,659 --> 01:26:30,340
is not a very dirty joke so it is better

1538
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:31,800


1539
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:35,460
not easy to talk about things when

1540
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:37,469
we are involved but if we talk

1541
01:26:37,469 --> 01:26:39,989
to people who  They are not involved of

1542
01:26:39,989 --> 01:26:42,239
course that changes everything so we must

1543
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:44,700
try

1544
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:48,390
and incorporate people with

1545
01:26:48,390 --> 01:26:51,510
different professional backgrounds who

1546
01:26:51,510 --> 01:26:52,980
are not really committed to

1547
01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:54,450
safety we have to talk to

1548
01:26:54,450 --> 01:26:56,160
people in a very understandable way

1549
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:58,869
without interference

1550
01:26:58,869 --> 01:27:02,728
only in that something will be added to them

1551
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:06,130
if I  It seems that also for the new

1552
01:27:06,130 --> 01:27:08,620
generations they could be very important

1553
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:13,030
to participate in this type of environment.  nces

1554
01:27:13,030 --> 01:27:14,800
security that we could start for

1555
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:17,770
example with universities with

1556
01:27:17,770 --> 01:27:19,870
master classes to teach towards

1557
01:27:19,870 --> 01:27:22,780
universities because there are no

1558
01:27:22,780 --> 01:27:27,100
security programs for example or

1559
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:30,090
forensic investigation programs

1560
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,940
are things that are only theoretical so

1561
01:27:33,940 --> 01:27:37,900
we could bring

1562
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:41,350
the technical part to other universities and with

1563
01:27:41,350 --> 01:27:43,060
this type of mentality also the

1564
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:45,840
new generations the new people

1565
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:49,260
who are going to graduate in the next year are

1566
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:51,910
going to have a new mentality in this way,

1567
01:27:51,910 --> 01:27:55,270
not the mentality is

1568
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:57,730
given that little work is required for

1569
01:27:57,730 --> 01:28:00,770
sure I agree with both

1570
01:28:00,770 --> 01:28:02,930
I think the world needs  more hardware

1571
01:28:02,930 --> 01:28:05,140
tst we

1572
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:08,140
need so to speak infect

1573
01:28:08,140 --> 01:28:09,580
more people with this idea of

1574
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:12,510
knowledge

1575
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:15,110
we must also think that technology

1576
01:28:15,110 --> 01:28:17,510
is not the solution it is part of the

1577
01:28:17,510 --> 01:28:19,070
solution but the solution is

1578
01:28:19,070 --> 01:28:22,240
humans and that training more people

1579
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:24,140
involve more people in the

1580
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:27,350
community  it really is the most important thing

1581
01:28:27,350 --> 01:28:29,240
that I think we can do in our

1582
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:32,390
careers  It is especially those of us who are

1583
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:34,040
in the communications part

1584
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:35,980
so hopefully I agree with you

1585
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:38,240
so I am going to use just two

1586
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:42,320
more questions and we are going to end this beautiful

1587
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:44,830
talk

1588
01:28:45,770 --> 01:28:49,400
I have always been very interested in talking

1589
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:52,580
about the old school and how

1590
01:28:52,580 --> 01:28:55,460
things  They have not changed

1591
01:28:55,460 --> 01:29:00,140
and I was wondering if Raúl you currently

1592
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:03,170
in your life talks about your

1593
01:29:03,170 --> 01:29:05,330
undertakings, they are what you did in the

1594
01:29:05,330 --> 01:29:07,670
90s and I was wondering if I could

1595
01:29:07,670 --> 01:29:10,010
discount it a little about what are

1596
01:29:10,010 --> 01:29:11,860
the main differences between

1597
01:29:11,860 --> 01:29:14,860


1598
01:29:15,390 --> 01:29:18,150
the Bank of Italy again for example  And now

1599
01:29:18,150 --> 01:29:21,030
the things you see in the newspapers is

1600
01:29:21,030 --> 01:29:24,420
some kind of relationship, not basically, it is

1601
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:27,450
a level of technology that is now

1602
01:29:27,450 --> 01:29:30,080
confused,

1603
01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:32,620
there have not been many changes, many

1604
01:29:32,620 --> 01:29:34,540
differences, for sure I want to

1605
01:29:34,540 --> 01:29:38,260
make sure when I here the bank of

1606
01:29:38,260 --> 01:29:43,070
Italy I simply found a login

1607
01:29:43,070 --> 01:29:45,310
there was a  back

1608
01:29:45,310 --> 01:29:49,090
of course there is no exploit left or

1609
01:29:49,090 --> 01:29:52,900
something like that it was just a patch that

1610
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:55,930
they had not applied so it is

1611
01:29:55,930 --> 01:29:58,960
from that persp  ective if we look at banks

1612
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:02,170
and finance because I still

1613
01:30:02,170 --> 01:30:05,460
disagree a bit why

1614
01:30:05,610 --> 01:30:08,040
they do not do very well but on the other hand

1615
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:10,650
they should focus on consumers and

1616
01:30:10,650 --> 01:30:13,650
the

1617
01:30:13,650 --> 01:30:16,290
data claims and protection laws

1618
01:30:16,290 --> 01:30:20,820
and outsourcing and yes they are

1619
01:30:20,820 --> 01:30:22,650
good companies but in security and

1620
01:30:22,650 --> 01:30:24,960
it is not their job it is not a main job

1621
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:26,909


1622
01:30:26,909 --> 01:30:29,040
so I would go to the times when I read

1623
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:31,920
or when I

1624
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:34,440
study

1625
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:38,489
regularly, it is not as easy as saying

1626
01:30:38,489 --> 01:30:43,100
that I have not seen well where

1627
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:48,710
a method can be used but

1628
01:30:48,790 --> 01:30:52,400
there are technical issues  There are issues

1629
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:55,159
and Cubans, it seems to me that confidence at

1630
01:30:55,159 --> 01:30:57,500
the end of the day because all the

1631
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:59,210
people who are in need as

1632
01:30:59,210 --> 01:31:02,120
we said before and we talk about this have

1633
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:04,070
a priority that has to do with

1634
01:31:04,070 --> 01:31:06,020
complying with complying, but if

1635
01:31:06,020 --> 01:31:08,239
we analyze it is what we think about

1636
01:31:08,239 --> 01:31:10,010
I do not know the vehicles or the

1637
01:31:10,010 --> 01:31:14,330
credit card processing most of

1638
01:31:14,330 --> 01:31:18,110
the successful attacks here the entities

1639
01:31:18,110 --> 01:31:20,970
all of them have

1640
01:31:20,970 --> 01:31:23,760


1641
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:27,210
the iso stamp or other type of s  systems like this

1642
01:31:27,210 --> 01:31:30,090
so I am not telling you that we do not need

1643
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:33,880
trust but I am saying

1644
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:38,480
that trust is not the final goal

1645
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:40,700
and again all these companies

1646
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:42,530
including banks and other

1647
01:31:42,530 --> 01:31:45,469
financial institutions should not forget

1648
01:31:45,469 --> 01:31:48,739
and at the end of the day on the other side

1649
01:31:48,739 --> 01:31:51,860
of whose screen  is attacking is a

1650
01:31:51,860 --> 01:31:54,980
person asking for something on his keyboard

1651
01:31:54,980 --> 01:31:57,650
and it seems to me that thank you very much for

1652
01:31:57,650 --> 01:31:59,600
sharing that information and sometimes I think

1653
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:02,330
that people were out of safety

1654
01:32:02,330 --> 01:32:05,239
for the world in idealistic safety

1655
01:32:05,239 --> 01:32:07,430
in the safety of the personal past that

1656
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:09,560
was different than the safety of the

1657
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:11,239
Today but sometimes these are the

1658
01:32:11,239 --> 01:32:15,590
numbers or the type of batz but the truth

1659
01:32:15,590 --> 01:32:18,470
is that they are usually human errors and at the

1660
01:32:18,470 --> 01:32:21,810
end of the story it is always the same

1661
01:32:21,810 --> 01:32:25,590
we are seeing the same thing but I have to give

1662
01:32:25,590 --> 01:32:28,680
the protocols they are but hey I

1663
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:33,390
do not see  that changing has changed me but the

1664
01:32:33,390 --> 01:32:36,030
mentality and the hours that are committed

1665
01:32:36,030 --> 01:32:41,130
remain the same, more less

1666
01:32:41,130 --> 01:32:43,290
in the last question before we

1667
01:32:43,290 --> 01:32:45,889
retire, it

1668
01:32:46,349 --> 01:32:48,900
is a vip box that

1669
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:51,239
eu has hit our planet and now

1670
01:32:51,239 --> 01:32:53,940
we live with the same problems in

1671
01:32:53,940 --> 01:32:57,120
italy in russia in the usa different

1672
01:32:57,120 --> 01:33:00,060
problems description weapons but it is the

1673
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:02,280
problem that probably no one

1674
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:05,429
leaves the house or goes out just a little as

1675
01:33:05,429 --> 01:33:07,320
you think it affects our

1676
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:09,890
near future

1677
01:33:09,890 --> 01:33:13,610
with respect to  a de stewart all our

1678
01:33:13,610 --> 01:33:16,730
online businesses living in a

1679
01:33:16,730 --> 01:33:21,020
faster online world and I wanted to do something

1680
01:33:21,020 --> 01:33:26,050
and listen to your vision about this

1681
01:33:26,820 --> 01:33:30,060
what do you see in the future well my

1682
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:32,760
answer is a phrase well I usually say

1683
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:35,760
in this type of case or question  If it is

1684
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:38,159
that we are sitting in a

1685
01:33:38,159 --> 01:33:40,230
very unstable chair and this very

1686
01:33:40,230 --> 01:33:43,480
unstable chair is on the internet

1687
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:47,470
to this paper and this line is going to fall

1688
01:33:47,470 --> 01:33:51,730
to treat it so of course it will not

1689
01:33:51,730 --> 01:33:54,010
be something so simple

1690
01:33:54,010 --> 01:33:56,230
and it is not such a simple answer but  It

1691
01:33:56,230 --> 01:33:58,210
seems to me that that is the message in general it

1692
01:33:58,210 --> 01:34:00,390
has to do with that

1693
01:34:00,390 --> 01:34:03,530
everything that surrounds

1694
01:34:03,590 --> 01:34:06,530
us there is also something that you would like to add,

1695
01:34:06,530 --> 01:34:07,830


1696
01:34:07,830 --> 01:34:10,960
just follow a sentence

1697
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:14,890
and we end with this as  Raúl has

1698
01:34:14,890 --> 01:34:16,450
already mentioned it

1699
01:34:16,450 --> 01:34:18,580
many times, all the new

1700
01:34:18,580 --> 01:34:22,600
technologies present us with new types

1701
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:25,469
of crimes, therefore many people

1702
01:34:25,469 --> 01:34:28,480
in the near future will also be more

1703
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:31,630
careful about their data, so we must

1704
01:34:31,630 --> 01:34:34,750
pay attention to our agreements and

1705
01:34:34,750 --> 01:34:37,330
really organize the new technology

1706
01:34:37,330 --> 01:34:41,070
that we incorporate in our  Terrific homes,

1707
01:34:41,070 --> 01:34:43,630
very clear I agree with

1708
01:34:43,630 --> 01:34:45,850
both and thank you very much for your time,

1709
01:34:45,850 --> 01:34:48,790
thank you very much for those

1710
01:34:48,790 --> 01:34:50,770
kind responses that you have given to the audience, it

1711
01:34:50,770 --> 01:34:53,700
has been a pleasure to talk with you and

1712
01:34:53,700 --> 01:34:56,890
I think that it is always interesting to see the

1713
01:34:56,890 --> 01:34:58,540
past to understand what we can

1714
01:34:58,540 --> 01:35:00,430
prepare for the future so thank you very

1715
01:35:00,430 --> 01:35:03,820
much thank you and thank you raúl and
