00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,870
Well, you already saw why a legend is necessary.

4
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,000
The truth is that this one has

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,489
more than 15 years of experience in the

6
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:49,040
field of cybersecurity. I believe that it

7
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,570
is one of those that has discovered the most

8
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,030
vulnerabilities in Windows.

9
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,730
Incredible story that he himself

10
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,040
can tell them and you also know

11
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,620
César several years ago for four

12
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,980
years he just won an award because

13
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,990
at that time he had been the exhibitor

14
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,670
who had been present with

15
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,369
us the most times in 8.8 we talked with César

16
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:12,229
and the truth is  that we lost count of

17
00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:13,520
how many times he has been because he has also

18
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,050
been in virtual conferences this

19
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,360
year with us and he is someone totally

20
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,520
from the family part 88 he is part of

21
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,680
the academic committee so obviously

22
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,929
we had to finish with him so

23
00:01:23,929 --> 00:01:27,050
welcome Cesar and thank you very much for  your

24
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:31,190
support and time to 8.8 legends both

25
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,350
thank you very much to open for the

26
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,140
presentation and for me it is an honor to be able to

27
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,750
participate again this time  in

28
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,780
virtual form but always the truth that I

29
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,210
love being able to collaborate and participate in

30
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:47,780
8.8 and this time, well,

31
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,830
unfortunately, there is a problem for the doctor

32
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,260
that everyone already knows,

33
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,400
we have to do it in virtual form,

34
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,970
but well, it also serves to continue

35
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,710
sharing knowledge and power

36
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,159
massively reach people no thank you

37
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,800
thank you the setting is all yours

38
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,470
good thank you very much

39
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,869
good today the presentation is called

40
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:14,349
I have my eyes discussion the ten laws

41
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:18,909
of discussion I would know well how to translate

42
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:20,349
into Spanish so that it looks good that

43
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:23,140
word we have we say the without  untranslated

44
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,649


45
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,330
is a very something very important term

46
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:33,440
within everything that is security is

47
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,810
the vulnerability and exclusion part what it

48
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:39,290
means when a person encounters

49
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:42,140
a security problem and wants to

50
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:46,610
report it either to the technology company

51
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,400
that produces that software or hardware that

52
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,470
it has a vulnerability or it could be

53
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,810
some coordinating organism some

54
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,599
being or it could be maybe a silver  form

55
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:59,959
of bach monti or it can be published so

56
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:02,510
that everyone can see it, it is

57
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,150
usually 0 days or a weakness is that

58
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,760
nobody knows what one wants not to

59
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,190
transmit so that they can be

60
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,030
fixed

61
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,480
this is because it is very important well

62
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,330
as most of the people will know

63
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,240
Cyber attacks are carried out through the

64
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,530
exploitation of some skills of

65
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,069
different types, so it is not less than

66
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:28,470
this process of reporting a

67
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,500
vulnerability that

68
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,130
the affected technology company can

69
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,810
receive that information, act

70
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,030
quickly, fix it, after publishing

71
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,490
a patch that people install the patch

72
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,970
and  that form is protected and it is like

73
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,820
the abc of cybersecurity is not

74
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,910
very important but in

75
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,950


76
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,860
reality most companies are so important because

77
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,930
nowadays there are technological company missions

78
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,160
most companies do not

79
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,569
really know how to do this whole

80
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:06,890
process well or  be how to have a way to

81
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,690
receive phase vulnerability reports

82
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:11,900
in an easy way how to work s  About

83
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,580
this vulnerability and how later to

84
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,890
produce a patch so that it is

85
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,529
updated by all the people who

86
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:22,190
use your software so well I have based

87
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,070
on my experience I have had to

88
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,790
report thousands of vulnerabilities

89
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,900
some found by me and others

90
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,370
found by the people who work

91
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,830
With me and an active medium who has worked

92
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,080
in other companies

93
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,360
and I have come across different types

94
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,569
of situations, sometimes very

95
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:45,860
rare situations and when I think that there is already a

96
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,560
global maturity that everything has

97
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,960
changed for the better,

98
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,759
I usually find new bad situations

99
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,940
and I see that everything remains the same then

100
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,820
this talk this idea of having the

101
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,430
story arose from good based on all

102
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,740
those bad experiences that I have had is

103
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,340
how they are would be like 10 tips

104
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,670
more than anything oriented to

105
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,930
technology providers in general

106
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,540
so that  know how to deal with the issue

107
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,670
of an exclusion habit know how to

108
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,370
communicate how to receive information

109
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:23,030
etc. and that d  In this way, not providing

110
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,890
a better service will protect your

111
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:29,120
customers and have more secure

112
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,639


113
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,039
software and well, we started with the first one

114
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,320
as I said, this is based on my

115
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,180
experience but anyone can be

116
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,090
good in layers that are more, the laws

117
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,470
could be more, they could be  At least

118
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,570
some would not have to go of course

119
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:51,180
it is valid if someone thinks like that

120
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,370
but well this is how I tried to

121
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,009
summarize my experience in general and

122
00:05:56,009 --> 00:05:59,340
come up with 10 laws that I consider

123
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,940
subtle when the first law says

124
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,919
vulnerability and reporting and software and

125
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,699
services right what does this refer to

126
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:10,610
this refers to that no matter what

127
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,139
report a vulnerability be an idiot

128
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,289
a stupid be a bad person whatever

129
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:19,199
it is if I am the

130
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,150
software or hardware provider and I have a good

131
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,520
life I have to bank it

132
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,070
and  ready no longer I have to accept it as it

133
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,810
is to treat it well the same even if it is

134
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:30,539
an idiot a stupid and say

135
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:33,870
anything because because it found a zero day

136
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:38,070
in my software then  It is if I treat him

137
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,800
badly if I do not pay attention to him what he

138
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,780
will do is publish that of 0 day and

139
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,849
everyone will be able to exploit it in

140
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:46,620
my software and that will have a

141
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,750
negative impact on the company, it

142
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,630
will affect  users etc then

143
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:55,250
this is this law is important because

144
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,650
there are many companies that want to

145
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,410
do things their way so maybe

146
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:04,080
they don't like the way one

147
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,470
reports the vulnerability and they treat you

148
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,970
badly, let's say if I find a

149
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,220
vulnerability of the  reported that he does

150
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,230
not treat me well he does not tell me

151
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:16,170
why this is like no no they are not

152
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,840
clear that the one who finds any way is

153
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,520
a person who is working for free

154
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,950
because he did a free service or he

155
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,450
detected a security problem yes  He

156
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:27,170
is reporting it he is using his

157
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:31,770
research time to find that

158
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,870
problem after reporting it after

159
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,580
making sure that it has been fixed, it is

160
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,680
working basically free

161
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,080
for companies that are multi-million companies out there

162
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,720
billionaire companies that

163
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,280
have thousands of resources so they have

164
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,490
to treat the person who reports the vulnerability well yes or yes

165
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:50,610
this is something

166
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,650
basic but seeing many companies do not

167
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,050
understand it

168
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:58,120
later we have another

169
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,850
other law that is very important which is to

170
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:04,180
have a very easy way to  How to

171
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,560
report vulnerabilities

172
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,560
many times it happens unfortunately that

173
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,690
a vulnerability is found then

174
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:15,990
say that the wind is called pepito

175
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,810
soft then I go to the pepito

176
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,000
soft page and it turns out that there is absolutely

177
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,460
no information on how to contact him

178
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,580
to report the vulnerability not

179
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,340
even an email  contact out there

180
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,530
have contact email for the

181
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:34,049
marketing sales part that I use the

182
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:36,150
same to report it skillfully

183
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,140
but it turns out that later I ended up

184
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,580
receiving spam and they want to sell me

185
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,490
something instead of responding about

186
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,190
the vulnerability or sometimes  This email tells me no, it

187
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,530
's not for that to

188
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,450
fix it alone, they don't even

189
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:51,620
help you  To contact you internally

190
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,760
with another person within the company

191
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,200
it has also happened to me that

192
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,600
and another thing that he resorted to is on

193
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,450
LinkedIn to look for people who work

194
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,870
for that company in hierarchical taxes

195
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,420
related to technology or related

196
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,220
to security the strata of

197
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,690
contacting them  by LinkedIn but it

198
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,380
is also a whole process to look for them to explain to them

199
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,240
that I do not want to sell anything that what I

200
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,890
want to do is report a

201
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:23,100
security problem and the truth is that it becomes very

202
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,830
very difficult with a lot of

203
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,920
time consumption and usually when a

204
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,640
company does not  It has a very clear

205
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,050
and easy mechanism to report

206
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,630
vulnerabilities, they do not respond, that is,

207
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,910
because it is in different ways and

208
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,980
by typologies if they do not have this, let's say

209
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,230
consideration, that is, they make me tell

210
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,760
a problem, make sure you use this email

211
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,180
to contact us and colloquially, they

212
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,430
will never  respond by linkedin or by other

213
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,460
means of communication so well it is

214
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,980
very important that each company has a

215
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,780
An easy way to tell I find

216
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,730
the truth within the website

217
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,620
how to report a vulnerability here

218
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,420
is the email send me the email and

219
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,670
that's it, it doesn't cost any work, it's very

220
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,500
simple, but hey, most

221
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,149
companies don't have

222
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:16,190
this law, which means that

223
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,740
Its rules and procedures are not

224
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,840
important, it has to do with the fact that

225
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,120
sometimes when reporting a

226
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,610
vulnerability

227
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,649
you will find that if you have a

228
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:30,260
clear mechanism to report part it says

229
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,730
good to report the vulnerability

230
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,829
you have to complete this form

231
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:35,930
then completely form and me

232
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:38,660
You have to put all this data that

233
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:42,110
1020 data fields were not completed and

234
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,850
if not it does not let you send the form

235
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,709
for example or they tell you well we

236
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:48,019
are working with this

237
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:50,240
backbone platform being you have to

238
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,640
register there you have to

239
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,980
also complete the form  as we are

240
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:58,010
told that you complete it and well and

241
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,600
complete that and then we will

242
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,130
contact you and in  The way we

243
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:04,339
want, that is, things do not

244
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:06,740
work that way for me, or the one who reports the

245
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,420
vulnerability will report it as they

246
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,640
want and on the other side, the

247
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,880
affected company has to receive that report and

248
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,220
deal with it, receive that

249
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,170
report and act  act

250
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,240
accordingly or follow up,

251
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,819
fix what is published, etc.

252
00:11:22,819 --> 00:11:26,449
but it seems very wrong for a

253
00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:28,850
company to force the person who reports

254
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,850
a vulnerability to follow a certain

255
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,929
procedure that is handled in a

256
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:34,639
certain way because, as I told you, whoever

257
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:35,869
finds a life is

258
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:37,910
working for free does not have  Why

259
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:40,459
do things as it seems to me the

260
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:42,169
affected company has to do things as

261
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:44,689
it seems to him because his time is his

262
00:11:44,689 --> 00:11:47,089
investigation it is the responsibility that

263
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:48,679
that person found then he will

264
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:51,109
report it whenever and however he wants and on

265
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:53,299
the other side  company has to

266
00:11:53,299 --> 00:11:56,109
deal with that in a smart way

267
00:11:56,109 --> 00:11:59,660
then this law has to do

268
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,999
with companies having what  e be

269
00:12:01,999 --> 00:12:02,809
clear that well,

270
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:04,189
the person who is going to report a

271
00:12:04,189 --> 00:12:06,350
vulnerability to me does not necessarily have

272
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,879
to follow my rules, they

273
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:10,609
will not necessarily want to complete a

274
00:12:10,609 --> 00:12:13,879
20-data form so that later I do

275
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:15,729
want to give them a thank-you t-shirt,

276
00:12:15,729 --> 00:12:17,660
not some too, and  He is

277
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,729
interested in the shirt, the only thing that

278
00:12:19,729 --> 00:12:21,410
interests him is to report an age so that it

279
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,359
is fixed and ready and not having to

280
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:25,110
waste time

281
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,660
living with a form see how to

282
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,279
do to be able to report

283
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,209
vulnerability

284
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,019
this other law has to do with what

285
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:40,750
sometimes happens that  One reports a

286
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,630
vulnerability and then as if on the

287
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,290
other side it is there is a black hole that

288
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,570
passes that swallows the information and one

289
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,360
does not receive any feedback or initially

290
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,550
they say good thanks for reporting the

291
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:58,360
vulnerability but later they do not tell you

292
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,670
that they are going to be or  when they are going to

293
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,700
fix it or if they are doing something

294
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,220
then this is this is very common

295
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,149
even in companies that already have an

296
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:13,360
appropriate mechanism for r  Report the

297
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,160
vulnerabilities but sometimes they either do not

298
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,579
care or forget to keep

299
00:13:18,579 --> 00:13:20,709
the person who reported the accounting informed

300
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:24,040
or it is the most logical and most useful thing to do is

301
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,279
to establish

302
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:29,550
a form of a time in which the company will

303
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,560
be informed  person for example

304
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,730
I find the vulnerability of the

305
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,910
reported they tell me good thanks for

306
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,019
reporting the vulnerability we are going to

307
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:41,220
review this report that you pass us and

308
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,439
we are going to comment to you to see what

309
00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:45,749
we find this may happen I do not know in

310
00:13:45,749 --> 00:13:47,160
a week so next week

311
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,529
We are going to let you know and then well the

312
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:51,870
issues of the week if we validate that the one

313
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:55,829
you have found is true

314
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:57,809
then well we are going to fix this

315
00:13:57,809 --> 00:13:59,100
this will surely

316
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,680
take 12 months to fix but how good is it

317
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,959
we are going to keep you updated every one or two

318
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,220
weeks  We are going to tell you how

319
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,569
this is progressing, we are not going to

320
00:14:06,569 --> 00:14:08,939
agree on how it is going to be published, etc.,

321
00:14:08,939 --> 00:14:11,819
that is why it would be like the ideal mechanism

322
00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:13,769
but sometimes companies like I said or

323
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:18,809
not  It matters or they forget to keep track

324
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:20,639
of when they are going to fix it if

325
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,350
they have already made progress if they are doing the

326
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,269
patch it

327
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:26,730
is very important that

328
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:30,480
they update the person with

329
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,040
everything they are doing regarding that

330
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,240
truth that has been reported

331
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:43,500
with this  Law 5, which is not to play dirty,

332
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,750
has to do with the fact that sometimes when one

333
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,600
reports a vulnerability there are companies

334
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,490
that are

335
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,610
going to play dirty in the following

336
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:57,050
way, a

337
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:59,180
certain type of with skills in a

338
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,250
certain type of software, the

339
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,980
hardware causes damage to the  companies

340
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,470
because they may have to spend

341
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:09,170
money and resources first in producing that patch

342
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:12,560
that this patch can be expensive to

343
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,529
do in time and resources and then

344
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:17,690
obviously extending that patch also

345
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:20,510
costs all customers time and resources,

346
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,640
which can be 10, 20 or millions

347
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,130
of  affected customers because they have to

348
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:31,490
update the software in order to avoid

349
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,019
this vulnerability, sometimes this

350
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:34,670
update can be complex

351
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:38,870
so it is common  or that the affected company

352
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:42,270
will not want to

353
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:45,180
hide that vulnerability or try

354
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,350
to buy time to see what to do

355
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,900
if it is going to fix it or not then they

356
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:56,160
use certain tricks to

357
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,620
deceive the person who reports the skills,

358
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,410
for example, it has happened to me  Something common

359
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,720
they do is say, well, look, we are

360
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,970
thank you for reporting the skill,

361
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:08,070
we will fix it, but maybe we

362
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,290
would like to hire your company to

363
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,900
help us with security in many

364
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,750
male sessions. I am not here to

365
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,810
sell you services.  so that

366
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,880
this good life is arranged if you want to

367
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,710
see the service this step with other

368
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,060
Haitian people who are in charge of the

369
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,820
services but I am not in that part

370
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,740
so good that the contact happened

371
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,150
because obviously the intention to

372
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,070
report some skill is not  that that

373
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,620
company hires me and it is not a portal

374
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,360
to be regulated later if they want to hire us it

375
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,950
is like they are asking

376
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,660
for your help to help them improve the

377
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,020
security is not a bad thing but hey he

378
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,610
did not try to stop those conversations

379
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:51,210
always always separated and clarify

380
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,860
that I am not selling a service

381
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,030
that has nothing to do with

382
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,770
vulnerability but what happens afterwards

383
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:59,000
as the

384
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,440
marketing part enters or enters others  to

385
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,510
work back then as they say well

386
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,490
we are going to hire ioactive for

387
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,260
certain services or sometimes also

388
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,260
to validate the patch they make of the

389
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:16,179
vulnerability but what happens

390
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:19,929
that negotiation is not that type of

391
00:17:19,929 --> 00:17:21,909
contract out there they want to get you an

392
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:26,829
idea that if one  He does not realize it, he may

393
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:28,929
later not allow you to publish that

394
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:31,419
vulnerability not then it is always the

395
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:34,059
clear one he does not look at all the work we

396
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:36,220
do is from here onwards the one

397
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,309
weakness was found before any

398
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:42,009
type of service that you want to hire or

399
00:17:42,009 --> 00:17:44,440
any contract not then the unit

400
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,970
it is going to be published you have to fix it

401
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,980
later apart from that from there

402
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,039
we can do any kind of work

403
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:54,190
o and also sometimes how the work

404
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,379
they want to hire is related

405
00:17:56,379 --> 00:17:59,919
to that vulnerability that was reported

406
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,450
sometimes what they do is like delay the

407
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,679
time then saying look at the

408
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:05,389
contract they have to sign

409
00:18:05,389 --> 00:18:08,629
the cto or something and he is just on vacation he

410
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:12,739
did not come  So legal that they have to

411
00:18:12,739 --> 00:18:15,769
fix something and how they use that and they

412
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:17,450
can throw it away for months and it has happened that

413
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:19,309
they have stretched it for years and one out

414
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:23,629
there from good faith tries to understand or

415
00:18:23,629 --> 00:18:24,739
understand,

416
00:18:24,739 --> 00:18:26,899
let's say different but the problems that

417
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:29,509
may be real  then they

418
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:32,419
wait there but when once

419
00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:34,909
months have passed and it turns out that nothing is not

420
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:36,829
specified they do not advance and continue to give an

421
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:39,259
excuse good if the relationship is cut it is

422
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:40,369
said good the vulnerability will be published

423
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,229
if you did not fix bad

424
00:18:42,229 --> 00:18:45,270
luck and it is published

425
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:49,020
sometimes as a common trick that they

426
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:52,250
try to do, that is, try

427
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,080
different mechanisms of how to buy

428
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,170
time and then see if the rule does not or

429
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,630
see what it is convenient for them to do that  It affects

430
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:04,140
minimally but well on my side of the

431
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,030
people who find skills

432
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,710
that what happens to the company is not

433
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,940
our problem that we

434
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,740
find the good ability we want

435
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,930
it to be fixed later if you have

436
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,070
business problems with your clients

437
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,830
that that  be handled well it has nothing

438
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,570
to do with the one who finds the

439
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:21,660
vulnerability so the real thing is this

440
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,190
is important that companies do not try

441
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,700
to cheat and buy time he says that he

442
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,780
finds a way because sooner or later it

443
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,790
ends badly because that always

444
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:32,810
always ends badly

445
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,710
with  This compensating has to do with

446
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:43,190
recognizing the effort that finds the

447
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,410
weakness loophole, either doing the

448
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,490
investigation finding the

449
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:49,370
vulnerability, reporting the waiting

450
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:52,310
for the network, etc.

451
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,650


452
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,990
In

453
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:59,650
public forms, many companies

454
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:03,880
have a page with jal of fame and

455
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,360
obtain when they lengthen the advisor and

456
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,550
that of the v  vulnerability what they do is

457
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:13,640
mention and thank the one who found the

458
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,100
good skill or some companies

459
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,410
may have an interest backbone they may

460
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,740
have von teese and then they give them money

461
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,600
it cannot be a gift a t-shirt a

462
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,870
book of anything but I think

463
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,520
this happens to thank no  because

464
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,740
someone is doing free

465
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,130
voice work and it is a very important job

466
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,690
today everything related to security

467
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,000
is being free that is helping to

468
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,440
improve the security of your product

469
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,770
so the

470
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:43,050
minimum that companies have to do

471
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,510
is public recognition and thank

472
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,970
that  person who helped you with this help,

473
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,950
but as I said, it has nothing to do with

474
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:54,940
something financial or material, only to

475
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,120
thank publicly, it was

476
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,389
good,

477
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,560
good, this is law 7, it has to do with

478
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,140
not putting an idea or threats in the middle of

479
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,950
many companies what  they do is when

480
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,230
one reports a vulnerability

481
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:18,200
try to threaten with

482
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,320
designated judgment but you have been watching this

483
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,360
softw  are or this hardware and it turns out that

484
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,520
it is forbidden to

485
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,260
reverse engineer our salvo so we are

486
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:31,880
going to denounce you or perhaps they want me to

487
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,059
sign it is a nn of a deceiving you in

488
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:37,010
some way it is but look you violate

489
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:39,740
such law but we are not going to  make judgments

490
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,230
and sign ges has an idea but the nba has

491
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,700
to do with not publishing it is some

492
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,190
weakness it has to do with threats to

493
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:48,679
take him to the judicial part of

494
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:50,600
the one who found the vulnerability in

495
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,720
general to hide it or to

496
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,169
prevent it from being public and this too  It has

497
00:21:57,169 --> 00:22:00,650
happened many times that it has been public

498
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:03,020
in important cases that sometimes happens

499
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,900
but we do not know it because it

500
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,820
is between the parties, it is

501
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,630
resolved there or there are not

502
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:14,320
always many interests at

503
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,720
stake when one is different when

504
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,810
one is a  Independent investigator

505
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,370
that is, he does not work for a company,

506
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,810
finds a good ability to

507
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:27,370
report if the vendor who is affected

508
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:30,520
tries to threaten him, make judgments, I

509
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,270
cannot tell him.  r nothing

510
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,950
come look for me I care let's say

511
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:35,320
I am going to publish it, [ __ ] you but when you

512
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,410
work for a company you are not like

513
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:39,970
representing that company so

514
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:43,360
there many things come into play it has

515
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,290
happened to me that when I want to publish, for

516
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,970
example, a vulnerability of a

517
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,010
certain company  What that company

518
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:54,610
did was talk to the company for

519
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:56,170
which I, one of the companies for which

520
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,900
I worked years ago, told them that they give me

521
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,580
incessantly public this we are not going to work any

522
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,620
more combo or looked but we are going to tell your

523
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,780
client that your company  Such a thing is like

524
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,740
they threatened one of my clients

525
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,720
so that I would not do something

526
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,260
also in very large companies, for

527
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,470
example, let's say if IBM finds a

528
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:20,049
good skill in another very important company,

529
00:23:20,049 --> 00:23:23,130
which are multinational

530
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:25,299
giant companies that have many

531
00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:27,280
interests through many contracts.  with

532
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,770
intermediate subsidiaries

533
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:31,240
then

534
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,630
there is a lot of legal a lot of business in

535
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,010
between so you can use

536
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:40,480
different different entertaining  Whoosh or something

537
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,840
to prevent a breakdown from

538
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,700
being public, not because, for example, the

539
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,380
company affects the basic

540
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,909
public icbm of that, we are going to

541
00:23:48,909 --> 00:23:51,010
cut this millionaire contract that

542
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,990
we have with a subsidiary of you or

543
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:55,270
we have this government contract.

544
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,409
to throw down then you are going to

545
00:23:56,409 --> 00:23:58,780
lose millions of dollars so that is

546
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,909
also a way to threaten or seek to

547
00:24:00,909 --> 00:24:03,390
hide things, hide good skills, it

548
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:07,309
also happens when

549
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:09,830
the company that is affected by the

550
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,559
vulnerability does not understand much the whole

551
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,990
mechanism of how skills are reported

552
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,039
as development, so it

553
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:18,970
thinks  that once he is trying to

554
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:21,830
blackmail him then as one

555
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,179
reports that vulnerability to him so that he

556
00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:26,360
contracts the services and after you

557
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,539
are doing this blackmail no

558
00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:33,409
blackmail this is how you work in

559
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:35,029
general in the world of security

560
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:36,559
how is a problem found?  reports

561
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,010
to be fixed look here

562
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:43,140
understand how this works and is not u  n

563
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:47,640
blackmail has also happened to me

564
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,179
once one of the people who worked

565
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:52,620
with me in active help found a

566
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:55,230
safe problem with some

567
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:58,950
electronic locks, it turns out that there was a line

568
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:01,020
of those electronic locks that was

569
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,510
used for top secret material or if you believe

570
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:06,600
in the us then when

571
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,610
This security problem was reported, which was in

572
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:11,190
an electronic lock, it was I think

573
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:14,570
that for ATMs that lengthened

574
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:18,500
the machines they use that we use to

575
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,320
extract money, so when

576
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,179
this a drink was reported but it was mentioned

577
00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:24,889
that the same vulnerability could

578
00:25:24,889 --> 00:25:27,070
affect other locks  electronic

579
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:29,600
than other models that are used for

580
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,950
toxics by the US government and well

581
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:39,139
it was produced I sent the report to the

582
00:25:39,139 --> 00:25:41,840
affected vendor and later it turns out that I receive an

583
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,590
email that was a scan of a

584
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:48,590
notification that was also sent to

585
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:52,100
iactive with a copy to the  n be it to the fbi the

586
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:57,230
cia to the us army and it is to that letter

587
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:00,669
addressed to me he said that if we

588
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:04,519
found something in some  good

589
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:05,720
skill in those

590
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,669
electronic locks we couldn't tell

591
00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:09,409
anyone and we only had to tell a

592
00:26:09,409 --> 00:26:11,210
certain organization of the US government

593
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:14,980
and that also owning

594
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,169
those electronic locks was illegal

595
00:26:17,169 --> 00:26:20,460
so no we couldn't have them

596
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:25,120
was basically something I don't know if  it was a

597
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,000
threat but it was like advice to tell me

598
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,710
no longer mess with everything if you get

599
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:32,530
in you told us and you handle yourself this

600
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:34,210
way if you can't get into

601
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:36,130
problems then it will be

602
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,500
interesting to receive a letter with that

603
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,660
warning with a copy to  The initial made

604
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:44,669
to the US army sets but hey

605
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:47,440
this happens like this happening today that when

606
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,090
reporting a has received threats and

607
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,950
commercial it depends on how you are standing

608
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,270
if you are independent can be whatever you

609
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,350
want for what you and you will not have

610
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,690
consequences but if one is part of

611
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,010
a company out there it becomes more difficult to

612
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:00,820
deal with those legal threats or

613
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,570
nba issues

614
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,730
or the eighth law

615
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:11,220
what has to do with putting the  to appropriate people

616
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,730


617
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,060
in a certain place because sometimes it happens

618
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,190
that a vulnerability is reported and the

619
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,660
person who positions on the other side is

620
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,450
someone from marketing or maybe someone receives it

621
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,770
but passes it to someone from

622
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,450
marketing then you realize

623
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:30,020
why why  the issue of how you start to

624
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,120
communicate or where you want to take

625
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,760
the communication does not have to do with the

626
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,310
technical, it does not have to do with wanting to

627
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:40,270
fix the vulnerability but rather it

628
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:43,820
has to do with how to minimize it how to

629
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,320
make it seem that this is not something

630
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,920
important then it really is

631
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,020
It is important that the person in

632
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:53,630
charge of receiving the reports of one of the

633
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,190
skills is someone who understands the

634
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:57,890
subject and can communicate in a good

635
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:01,280
way with the one who reports as said in

636
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,790
the first law, not that on the other side the one

637
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,320
who reports the currency can  being an

638
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,760
idiot can be crazy or something but

639
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,430
we have to be a company affected

640
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,630
by unity we have to know how to

641
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,630
communicate it we have to treat it well

642
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:17,450
then in that location in that

643
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,310
position the one who receives the

644
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,540
security information has

645
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,010
with very good communication that he has

646
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,570
good treatment that he understands the

647
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:25,400
problem that he has experience in

648
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,410
how vulnerabilities are reported

649
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:29,180
that he has experience in the problems

650
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,460
that may arise because if  There are not

651
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:35,300
many problems I report the

652
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,620
vulnerability of the result and the other

653
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,750
person says no but this does not work or

654
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,000
this is something else or I do not like what

655
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,530
you send me, they send you half in another way

656
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:45,050
then that causes the person who

657
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,820
reports the vulnerability  get angry I

658
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,680
can't communicate well then it ends

659
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,890
badly usually it is very important that

660
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:55,310
if I have a mechanism for a way to

661
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:57,530
receive information on good

662
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,600
skills and then not fix it

663
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,400
I have published the patches I have to have

664
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,640
the appropriate people in all that mechanism

665
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,130
to  that it works well but in ways

666
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:08,540
that I have a mechanism I have a

667
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,670
correct way to receive the reports

668
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:13,550
A skill, if the one who handles all this

669
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:16,040
does not do it well, it will end badly, in

670
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,340
general,

671
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:24,860
Law 9 has to do with coordinating

672
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,620
because, well, this whole process of

673
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:30,830
reporting vulnerabilities

674
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,799
requires good coordination because if it

675
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:37,670
cannot happen that the company  Affected, for

676
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:40,490
example, patch the vulnerability and if I

677
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,460
report the vulnerability it does not warn me

678
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,540
since if I do not find out that it has already

679
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:48,320
broken it and it turns out that it may be that I

680
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,240
have done it on purpose I have done it

681
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,530
silently so that nobody finds out

682
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:53,240
then fix it sometime  They do not

683
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,700
tell anyone or it could be because they

684
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,760
forgot to tell me, for example, it has also happened to me

685
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,490
that a company has told me

686
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,950
if this Christmas we are going to

687
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:07,850
march at the end of the month there we are going to make

688
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:10,720
the minister patch and it turns out that it is good

689
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,880
later  At the end of the month, two weeks had passed since

690
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,559
we finally decided

691
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:18,890
and we are going to publish an advisor with the

692
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,900
details of some skill and we

693
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,400
publish it and then I realize that

694
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,559
in  In reality, this company had not

695
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,179
published the patch

696
00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:28,519
but at the public level, it was injured, yes,

697
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:31,009
but it was delayed, it was delayed so it was not

698
00:30:31,009 --> 00:30:32,149
public so we had to

699
00:30:32,149 --> 00:30:34,399
take out what we had published

700
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:35,929
because it was not yet gone but

701
00:30:35,929 --> 00:30:38,389
that was still due to communication problems,

702
00:30:38,389 --> 00:30:39,679
not because  They

703
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,330
first did something to me that they were going to do but it

704
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:44,629
turns out that later you don't do it then

705
00:30:44,629 --> 00:30:47,389
what they do exposes people because

706
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:48,679
the details of the

707
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:50,269
vulnerability are published but the patch is not

708
00:30:50,269 --> 00:30:53,840
available it has also happened to me that with

709
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,720
an important vulnerability in a

710
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,230
hardware  Known in the US we

711
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,999
reported the vulnerability but it

712
00:31:01,999 --> 00:31:03,259
turns out that the person on the

713
00:31:03,259 --> 00:31:05,040
other side

714
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,300
did not answer right away and tried to

715
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,490
contact another by another means or in

716
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,350
parallel with the person who had

717
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:16,220
found the truth not to me and

718
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,750
then well said but rather  rest

719
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:21,180
assured that we are going to fix it and

720
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,860
after months passed months passed

721
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,110
we asked them and when will they go

722
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,430
to fix even with skills to

723
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,260
fix no one ever told us

724
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,830
context so well we decided to

725
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:33,450
publish the details of the

726
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:36,630
vulnerability and it turns out that after we

727
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,440
published

728
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,140
the vendor came out to say nothing but that

729
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,430
vulnerability is old and the rule is more than

730
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:44,190
months then what happens to me

731
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:46,250
They deceived us on purpose or they

732
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,390
fixed that vulnerability they did not

733
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,190
tell anyone so when

734
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,900
we published they said why

735
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,370
that is old it is already fixed nothing does not

736
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,539
happen

737
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:59,019
then this also causes

738
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:01,299
problems not because they hide the

739
00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:03,190
information it is not fixed a truth

740
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:05,499
but no  They tell people not to

741
00:32:05,499 --> 00:32:07,509
look bad so as not to say look, we had

742
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:09,519
this very serious vulnerability that

743
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,389
exposed your privacy or could allow

744
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:15,399
it to check you between devices but we did

745
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:17,169
not fix it in silence, we

746
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:20,200
communicate nothing and it turns out that when

747
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,149
we are going to publish it does not say anything

748
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:24,009
since you publish you do not have

749
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:26,080
importance for soria we fix it

750
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,789
well well t  Everything was also due to a lack

751
00:32:27,789 --> 00:32:30,429
of coordination, in this case it seems to

752
00:32:30,429 --> 00:32:31,899
me that it was on purpose after the other

753
00:32:31,899 --> 00:32:33,190
party informed us that it was on purpose

754
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:35,259
that they forgot to

755
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:37,960
notify us, but for me, those things do not

756
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,989
exist on a professional level  So

757
00:32:40,989 --> 00:32:42,879
well, it is very important to coordinate more

758
00:32:42,879 --> 00:32:45,879
than anything to protect the people

759
00:32:45,879 --> 00:32:48,460
affected by the cross is the technology but

760
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:52,749
also to be aware of

761
00:32:52,749 --> 00:32:54,669
whether it finds some skill

762
00:32:54,669 --> 00:32:56,259
as the affected company that

763
00:32:56,259 --> 00:32:58,629
the two are in sync to know  When

764
00:32:58,629 --> 00:33:00,099
is it going to be fixed when to publish the

765
00:33:00,099 --> 00:33:01,490
advice

766
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:05,200
publish the details etc

767
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,970
which is

768
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:13,000
the last the last law that because it is the

769
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,270
last is not the least important has

770
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:19,170
to do with publishing and with what I said

771
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:22,740
previously, there happens

772
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,570
what reports a vulnerability to us  the

773
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:26,190


774
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:29,460
affected company reacts well to the public rule

775
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,279
the patch but when it publishes the patch it

776
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,809
does not say that there were security problems

777
00:33:33,809 --> 00:33:36,629
as long as a common long-

778
00:33:36,629 --> 00:33:39,269
hour patch  as an optional patch

779
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:42,029
so people can update their system

780
00:33:42,029 --> 00:33:47,309
or not and this has to do with

781
00:33:47,309 --> 00:33:50,970
deception for me because if you have

782
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,860
a security problem in your product and

783
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,539
publish a patch you have to

784
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:56,909
let your customers know so  protect what

785
00:33:56,909 --> 00:34:00,720
was released that patch that fixes the

786
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,769
security problem and that it is

787
00:34:01,769 --> 00:34:04,350
important that people install the

788
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:07,379
patch to protect themselves but as I said

789
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,629
many times it happens that the patch is released

790
00:34:09,629 --> 00:34:11,849
but it is not said that it is security

791
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:14,620
is not informed to  The clients then

792
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,460
we

793
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,679
tell them I sell tenth you have to

794
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,599
tell people that a problem ensures that they

795
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,250
update the patch they say no no because

796
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:26,190
this software patches only

797
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,599
have a certain type of client

798
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:28,918
so I will update it when I

799
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:31,050
can.  They always look for an

800
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:33,500
excuse, some explanation,

801
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,570
but for me there is no excuse for

802
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:38,840
a long company, a patch and that patch

803
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,889
in solution to the security problem

804
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:42,139
has to let them know  To find out to your

805
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:44,690
clients what security problems you fix,

806
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:47,570
you also have to tell them what the

807
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:50,389
possible risk is if they don't update their

808
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:52,460
systems so that person can decide if they are

809
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:55,159
going to install that patch or not or when

810
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:58,150
they are going to do it but not

811
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:01,420
and not publish the  details so that

812
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:04,359
not so that people do not know if that

813
00:35:04,359 --> 00:35:06,220
is something of security if it is serious or not, it

814
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,890
must be published in detail that is,

815
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:11,890
how components affect what the

816
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,599
risk is and well the person can continue

817
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,870
to pike the patch, not when  It will do

818
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:19,170
good as you

819
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:21,960
see this was like a summary of

820
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,380
tasks are like 10 tips 10 laws

821
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:28,470
that are mainly oriented to

822
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:32,520
technology companies or companies in

823
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,740
general that have to deal with

824
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,910
security problems that are

825
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:38,609
reported to them this law has to do  How to

826
00:35:38,609 --> 00:35:41,190
do it in the best way than how to

827
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:44,460
avoid problems, how in the

828
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,680
end it will lower it, it will end up helping

829
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,390
companies to protect their customers more

830
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:52,760
but it may also be that I have

831
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,150
missed  or sometimes there are others

832
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,200
but hey this is based on my

833
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,720
experience and it seems to me that they are a

834
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,098
way of

835
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:05,599
synthesizing something basic that any company

836
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:09,559
can read these ten laws can try

837
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:11,690
to incorporate taking this into account in their

838
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:14,000
process of a habit  of exclusion and I

839
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,309
am sure that it will help you a lot and

840
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:18,109
it will also help you to get along

841
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:20,029
with the people who report the

842
00:36:20,029 --> 00:36:21,950
skills and it will also help you to

843
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:24,400
protect your clients more

844
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:30,660
I hope you liked the presentation

845
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:33,100
I

846
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,770
am available if  They want to contact

847
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:38,830
me and have email and twitter information

848
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,930
so they can tell me anything and

849
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:44,930
we keep in touch a lot it has been

850
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:47,059
very good to be able to present today so

851
00:36:47,059 --> 00:36:49,829
good that is all

852
00:36:49,829 --> 00:36:53,249
thank you thank you even though you had a very

853
00:36:53,249 --> 00:36:55,349
good time I really loved the laws

854
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:57,200
in fact

855
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,300
The truth is that I have had experience

856
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,890
doing the same, participating in

857
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:03,200
research and the truth is that I think

858
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,300
there are very few times that

859
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:08,300
I actually do it  Ptan say thank you and

860
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,460
everything is fine and in general they are more the

861
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:13,370
ones where they try to sue you or do

862
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:17,900
something else in your case, what was the biggest

863
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,420
problem you had reporting a

864
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,700
vulnerability without saying the name if

865
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:26,380
you can't tell about the company problems

866
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:30,320
In general, in serious problems such as that

867
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,870
I have not had, there have always been problems

868
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:36,770
with companies that do not want to fix

869
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:38,510
good ability, as they want to

870
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,720
hide it

871
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,670
or they pressure you in a different way

872
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:47,010
as I said that part of the temple and dirty

873
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:51,380
as trying to screw

874
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,940
somewhere differently  When one is an

875
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,950
independent researcher who can

876
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:58,440
do whatever he wants, but when one is

877
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,290
part of a frank company, certain

878
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:02,910
things that you cannot do and there is a

879
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:05,900
lot at stake, then one has to

880
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:11,190
try to see within the legal

881
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:16,109
within the contractual how to do  The good thing

882
00:38:16,109 --> 00:38:18,780
that always in active help we are

883
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,849
clear that when a vulnerability is reported

884
00:38:20,849 --> 00:38:21,770


885
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:25,079
afterwards we seek to fix that

886
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:26,700
we are quite flexible  ible so we do

887
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,260
not give three months for the rule to

888
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,730
enter sometimes and they say that the problem

889
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,829
give me a month madama a week hand there is

890
00:38:31,829 --> 00:38:35,309
no problem but there is always a

891
00:38:35,309 --> 00:38:37,619
good report and then

892
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:40,020
an advisor and a blog post are published to the viewer  or

893
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,569
presentations with more or less details

894
00:38:42,569 --> 00:38:44,670
but it is always done even when they are

895
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:48,290
clients we have clients for years

896
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:50,960
and well they are mature in terms of

897
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,400
security so not only do we find

898
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,360
a security problem we

899
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,190
report it to them they fix it and then we

900
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:57,500
publish the details and no no no no

901
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,230
They tell us or do not publish those of these

902
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,970
they tell us good to publish it, there is no

903
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,910
problem but as long

904
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:08,810
as the patch is ready and ready and it is

905
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:11,690
coordinated, but there are other companies

906
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:14,990
that feel threatened or do not

907
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:17,960
want you to publish the details and

908
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,030
depending on the situation they will look for

909
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:23,150
how to hide that problem or how

910
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:26,330
to pressure you not to publish but

911
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:29,300
luckily there are serious problems I have not

912
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,040
had clear

913
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,810
anecdotes about  As a matter of fact, Ruber

914
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:34,700
told us when he gave the talk this year

915
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,890
with us that he controls putting

916
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:39,860
skill in the boe, also of course there were

917
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,440
many people from the US aeronautical association who

918
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,480
were like

919
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,640
pressing for him to give us the talk

920
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,480
and he had many meetings with lawyers, etc. of

921
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,460
course  It is logical, perhaps anyone

922
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,080
would think that what they found is very serious

923
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,830
and if that happens they seek to

924
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:02,610
pressure you from different places and,

925
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:05,130
being part of a company, you also

926
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:07,590
have a responsibility within that

927
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:10,020
company because it is a company that

928
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,960
your business has its services then

929
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,850
It is not that you can act in a different

930
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,680
way, you have to act within the law

931
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,860
within your responsibilities and it is

932
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,840
better when one is independent if one

933
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,330
is independent and they threaten the tenth

934
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:27,950
I do not care come find me here

935
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:32,040
and long the herodes but when one

936
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,600
It is part of a company it is more difficult

937
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,720
due to the responsibilities that exist and

938
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,560
the interests that are

939
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,990
clear here because this opinion

940
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:43,540
The part of publishing it is also important

941
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,550
because at one time it also happened to me that

942
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,750
we published it through the

943
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:49,870
regular channel and we gave it all three months and

944
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,040
then we published it

945
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,190
and then of course a lot of

946
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:55,840
altercations with the ceo was shaking but

947
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,880
because they published it

948
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,520
in  Publishing has to do with making

949
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,200
known what it is about, it is some

950
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,650
skill and it really affects what the

951
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:09,040
risk has because many times it is

952
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,490
common for the affected company

953
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:14,710
to lower the risk as it wanted

954
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:16,180
not good it was in the area is not very

955
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:19,480
important  or so that in order for it to be

956
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,520
exploited, this and this is necessary,

957
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,460
as they always try to lower the

958
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:27,100
risk and usually it is not so,

959
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,770
then when one publishes the details,

960
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:31,810
people who know about security really do

961
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:34,330
and if it is not this vulnerability it can be

962
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:36,790
exploited under these conditions then it

963
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:39,610
has a certain risk and also by

964
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:41,770
logic when something is published the risk

965
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:44,500
that is published is a general risk that

966
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:48,190
general risk  It varies according to the company, if

967
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:50,710
I use the software in my company, it is

968
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:53,290
with that configuration that I have

969
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:54,940
in my company, it may be different from the

970
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,500
others. It has companies that use the same

971
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,720
software, so if I have access to

972
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,240
the details, it allows me to really

973
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,800
know  The risk to my organization

974
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,560
for my company and I can say well

975
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,600
this patch if I really need to

976
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,930
install it right now or I can wait because

977
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:12,700
since I use that software for the

978
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,680
configuration that I have, it does not affect me

979
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,980
much, it

980
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,400
is very important for that and we will see

981
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,840
the details of a vulnerability to

982
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,060
assess the risk more than anything and

983
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,609
also sometimes

984
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:28,130
if there is no patch or the patch

985
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:31,160
does not really solve the problem to

986
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,049
see what other measures I can take

987
00:42:33,049 --> 00:42:35,989
to minimize that vulnerability and

988
00:42:35,989 --> 00:42:38,789
minimize the risk

989
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:42,329
and this that always  It happens with the

990
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:45,239
project zero of google that they say

991
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:46,979
is this a skill is being

992
00:42:46,979 --> 00:42:49,919
exploited in the wild or we

993
00:42:49,919 --> 00:42:51,929
publish it so that everyone knows  ny can

994
00:42:51,929 --> 00:42:54,329
protect themselves from that and it makes sense

995
00:42:54,329 --> 00:42:55,949
out there not because if if a

996
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:57,839
vulnerability is being exploited and

997
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:59,669
well you know it you do not know how to

998
00:42:59,669 --> 00:43:02,039
protect yourself changes that you know it you know

999
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:04,499
how to protect yourself obviously other people

1000
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:06,630
can take advantage of that unit to attack

1001
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:09,599
but at the same time all the  The world can know

1002
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,579
how to protect itself, so it seems that it

1003
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:13,880
makes sense as long as

1004
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,769
the information can be shared so that one

1005
00:43:16,769 --> 00:43:19,049
can determine risks and

1006
00:43:19,049 --> 00:43:21,900
better protect oneself, it seems to me that it is explained

1007
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,760
and of course

1008
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,040
definitely agree with you.

1009
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,120


1010
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,690
more practical for a company to

1011
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,250
use a bach bounty platform

1012
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:33,840
to report vulnerabilities or

1013
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,450
the costs may be higher

1014
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:41,110
the truth is that I do not know the costs

1015
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:44,440
may be able to use an

1016
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,570
endurance company but not that company no that does not

1017
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:49,680
have to replace the whole process  of

1018
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,780
vulnerability discussion let's say yes I

1019
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,600
am a technology company

1020
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,850
I have to t  Make my process clear because

1021
00:43:57,850 --> 00:43:59,080
I have to be clear first that there are going to

1022
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,670
be security problems then

1023
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:03,790
define how these

1024
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:06,250
problems are going to be reported to me how I am going to communicate how

1025
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:08,820
the problems are reported how I am going to

1026
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:11,530
make the patches publish them as

1027
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:13,210
either vice or that's it  The company has to

1028
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:15,010
have it, then it can be used as a

1029
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:17,170
tool as part of that process, it

1030
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:19,000
can use a platform from poch

1031
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,490
monti, but for me it doesn't have to be done

1032
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:22,510
in isolation, it

1033
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:25,060
has to be well coordinated with

1034
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:25,990
the company's procedures,

1035
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:28,360
so if I'm going to report  A good

1036
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,770
short scene or look, you have to use this

1037
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:31,840
backbone platform, you already

1038
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:35,050
bother me because I don't want to have to

1039
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:36,790
fill out a form in a certain

1040
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:39,640
way, create an account and guide me through

1041
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,110
that system.

1042
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:43,570
vulnerability of the

1043
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:47,530
company report it and fix it

1044
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:50,290
like a stone in the way for

1045
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:53,130
some and for others not then well

1046
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:57,130
reported the problem  It is there but that the

1047
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:58,630
back company wants and then it has to

1048
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:01,660
have a very clear communication, a

1049
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,160
very clear mechanism with the

1050
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,650
affected company so that later they are not telling me, do

1051
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:07,540
not look, I need more

1052
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:10,210
information about the company, it goes when I

1053
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:11,770
need to send me more information than  They

1054
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:13,420
are asking me from the affected company

1055
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,040
then as if someone gets in between

1056
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,320
that instead of facilitating things

1057
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,750
worsens all communication, that is, it

1058
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,790
seems good to me that they want to use

1059
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:23,440
tools such as a

1060
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,150
beaumont platform and for the issue of

1061
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:27,520
reporting a skill etc. but  that it

1062
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,410
is well used and not that it generates more

1063
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:31,780
problems instead of solving the

1064
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:33,760
problems

1065
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,250
and now recently it happened to me that

1066
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:39,240
there was

1067
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,970
a good life that reported mission that

1068
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:43,680
was through this platform from

1069
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,420
when then I had to create an

1070
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:46,890
account that I did not  I had to report

1071
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:49,950
there and then they asked me and told me you give me it

1072
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:51,960
was about affected hardware

1073
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,580
semester, don't look, we don't have e  l

1074
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:55,080
hardware and I say well, what do I

1075
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:58,470
care about the skill work

1076
00:45:58,470 --> 00:45:59,790
of how hardware is going to have us if

1077
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,590
you have to test the unit so that they

1078
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:03,780
hire you, you are not going to go

1079
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,970
we have to pass the information

1080
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:09,540
explain to me more good then  In that

1081
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,559
aspect, I see what

1082
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:14,769
and what it does, instead of generating an

1083
00:46:14,769 --> 00:46:16,900
easier mechanism for communication,

1084
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,950
hinders communication.

1085
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:22,109


1086
00:46:22,109 --> 00:46:24,119


1087
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:27,240


1088
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,770
be something that

1089
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:34,390
speeds up the process and not that the complex

1090
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:36,460
looks that there is a question in this case

1091
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,700
of youtube they say if you ever heard

1092
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,039
from a colleague friend whoever

1093
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:43,960
found a vulnerability did not

1094
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,390
report it and later took advantage

1095
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:51,180
of this not the truth that

1096
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,480


1097
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,520
people who work in ajax do not always activate in May they

1098
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,220
know that they are in a good

1099
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:00,740
skill they have to report it

1100
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:04,820
because nothing was reported to me and then they reported it and

1101
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:08,859
other than that they did not  Real is everyone

1102
00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:11,210
finds a problem and tries to

1103
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:15,010
report it in good I myself

1104
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:17,570
years ago I had gotten angry and did not

1105
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:20,270
report it, it sold at 0 days but well it

1106
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:22,940
sold it and we do playback for

1107
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,950
canvas at that time that was many

1108
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:28,070
years ago in  person had been angry with

1109
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:30,200
microsoft com with novak or because there were

1110
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,480
two the first days of a virtue to

1111
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,070
listen and really there were many

1112
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:35,540
problems and hey problems at that time it

1113
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:39,070
was the Wild West

1114
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:42,590
and it sold zero we depended on it to

1115
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:44,540
assure me that it was for companies and it was

1116
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:46,040
for security  and it was not for

1117
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,619
governments and is that one of the reasons

1118
00:47:48,619 --> 00:47:50,540
why I stopped after doing it was

1119
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:54,260
because although one can sell 0 days to

1120
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:56,599
companies that are responsible for

1121
00:47:56,599 --> 00:47:59,180
once one gives that information they do not know

1122
00:47:59,180 --> 00:47:59,990
where it ends

1123
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:03,950
or maybe that  that company is a

1124
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:05,780
security consulting company that

1125
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,730
is going to use reptilian text for penetration,

1126
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:11,240
whatever it is, but I don't know if that

1127
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,800
information later comes out and

1128
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,490
some government reaches them then

1129
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:17,470
She was also a reason because

1130
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:21,090
I decided not to stop depending on zero days

1131
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:23,290
but they go at this time if I had

1132
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:25,320
information of good skills the

1133
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:29,440
reported ones that I had to see for

1134
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,600
reasons of all the problems I

1135
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,690
had had because I was always

1136
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:38,290
clear that  we have companies like

1137
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,840
microsoft oracle google that are

1138
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,900
visionary companies that have millions of

1139
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:47,170
dollars and have a lot of money with

1140
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:49,420
which they make software they do

1141
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:52,420
research I said why am I going to

1142
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:55,690
donate my work to them on the vulnerabilities

1143
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:57,490
that i find i am going to give them to them

1144
00:48:57,490 --> 00:49:00,730
free and then they treat me badly or

1145
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:02,740
do not know how to manage this whole issue

1146
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,270
of vulnerability these six pressed

1147
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:06,340
and I'm not going to work for free to

1148
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:08,140
start multi visionary

1149
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:10,930
so if they want the herodes and

1150
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:13,470
accessories,

1151
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:18,730
talk to people from microsoft I was telling

1152
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:22,150
them 15 years ago  that they would have to have

1153
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:25,960
something to reward people but

1154
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,569
hey

1155
00:49:27,569 --> 00:49:29,190
at that time there were people who thought

1156
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:31,680
like me but there was another gene

1157
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,809
Microsoft's management team that this idea

1158
00:49:33,809 --> 00:49:35,400
seemed very crazy to them, luckily those people

1159
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,789
I think that this is no more and then

1160
00:49:38,789 --> 00:49:41,400
it evolved but it took

1161
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,769
many years for companies like

1162
00:49:43,769 --> 00:49:47,189
Microsoft to recognize and it has

1163
00:49:47,189 --> 00:49:48,900
rebounds

1164
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,700
but hey all those companies that  Before they

1165
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,170
were very problematic today they are

1166
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:54,150
the most mature because because they started

1167
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:57,360
as problems a long time ago but in

1168
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:00,270
turn many new

1169
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:03,210
technology companies have no idea about the

1170
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:06,030
security issue of a habitat distribution and

1171
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:07,950
those are the most problematic but

1172
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:10,800
luckily the

1173
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,550
Today, most large software companies are already mature and do not

1174
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:17,880
cause problems the way you think it

1175
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:22,110
is - already with microsoft with oracle very

1176
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:23,970
well very well this area and it shows

1177
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:26,580
the power of a true hacker hears the

1178
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:29,090
last question

1179
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:32,390
how to do it in areas that  They require

1180
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:34,640
certain confidentiality protocols

1181
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,349
in case of finding vulnerabilities

1182
00:50:36,349 --> 00:50:40,089
as in the case of banking for example

1183
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:43,900
but that would be n  or I know if it refers to

1184
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:48,310
some skills open technology or

1185
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:50,590
proprietary technology that are internally

1186
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:52,900
rags that are doing research

1187
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,880
but in an area such as financial the

1188
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,610
banking that require more protocols than

1189
00:50:57,610 --> 00:51:00,510
other areas

1190
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:04,000
if I do not know if it is something very specific but

1191
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,650
has to do with  What they said in general is

1192
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:07,330
that if you find a vulnerability

1193
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:10,480
to look for, it is good to report it and it depends

1194
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,940
on the other party what to

1195
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:15,550
do with this report.

1196
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:17,770


1197
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:19,270


1198
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:21,640
In other words, it has to see how to deal

1199
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:24,040
with this in the best way. I believe that

1200
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:27,430
when there is good communication,

1201
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:29,500
we humans, the people who

1202
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,230
understand each other and can reach an

1203
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:34,329
agreement, what is not right is

1204
00:51:34,329 --> 00:51:35,200
when they want to

1205
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:39,040
hide this class because  There it has

1206
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,829
to do with how well there was a serious problem,

1207
00:51:40,829 --> 00:51:43,300
for example in the home banking system,

1208
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,280
someone reports the rule to us and

1209
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,170
they don't want to hide it later.  so as not to

1210
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:50,140
be exposed but that is one is an

1211
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:53,349
old view because everyone has to

1212
00:51:53,349 --> 00:51:56,559
understand that all software can have

1213
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:58,150
security problems but the

1214
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:00,670
important thing is how one reacts to

1215
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:02,410
those problems is to say what answer does it give,

1216
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:05,290
how it fixes it, how it communicates with

1217
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:06,190
people

1218
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:08,190
with  People afterwards with the clients

1219
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:11,470
communicating to them is the vulnerability

1220
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:13,089
that what was it about how it was fixed

1221
00:52:13,089 --> 00:52:15,700
then one being the affected company

1222
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,170
can even look good with the

1223
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:18,160
clients because yes, well,

1224
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,809
sorry, we had this

1225
00:52:19,809 --> 00:52:22,270
security problem but we fixed it luckily

1226
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:24,180


1227
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:27,119
nobody was  impacted, this pint of

1228
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:28,829
summer was exploited because we

1229
00:52:28,829 --> 00:52:30,329
fixed it on time so well, they

1230
00:52:30,329 --> 00:52:31,500
are already protected, everything is fixed

1231
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:34,530
and we thank Juan Pérez for

1232
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:36,809
having transformed the answer that

1233
00:52:36,809 --> 00:52:40,950
there is a certain vision that sees that as

1234
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:43,829
negative but as we are going to recognize that

1235
00:52:43,829 --> 00:52:45,329
we had a security problem if

1236
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:47,940
we are a bank then they want to

1237
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:50,520
hide it but you have  It has to be like

1238
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,130
that, it has to be to understand that anyone can

1239
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:54,809
have security problems, the

1240
00:52:54,809 --> 00:52:56,460
important thing is how one reacts to

1241
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:57,780
that,

1242
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,640
yes, yes, I think you also referred to

1243
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:02,130
perhaps as the way to report it and

1244
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:04,320
report it responsibly confidentially

1245
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:07,260
and obviously not to make it public on

1246
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:09,290
social networks.

1247
00:53:09,829 --> 00:53:14,339
You have to report it well through the

1248
00:53:14,339 --> 00:53:16,950
channel, it is appropriate and it is something that you do not

1249
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:18,630
find in response there, well, you

1250
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:22,349
can publish it, but well, you also

1251
00:53:22,349 --> 00:53:23,490
find problems about it, you are also

1252
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:25,530
free to publish them, you can not do what

1253
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:30,410
you want that does not work, I do not see it badly.

1254
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:33,079
What I see badly is when someone

1255
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:36,500
does something with malicious intent, for example

1256
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:39,450
if I

1257
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:42,320
say I can sell knives

1258
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,820
because people use it to eat but

1259
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:46,560
if someone comes and I know they are a

1260
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,900
murderer to buy a knife and I

1261
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,330
sell it to them  I can think that the knife

1262
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:54,650
is going to use it for the worse, not then

1263
00:53:54,650 --> 00:53:58,650
the main cause of the

1264
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:03,630
security problem is the company that developed that

1265
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:07,140
technology  and he sold it and well and he had

1266
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:09,210
a hamlet security problem the

1267
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:10,620
cause of the problem is not the one who

1268
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:12,390
finds the vulnerability who

1269
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:14,460
finds the good viability with that

1270
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,720
information, he can do whatever he wants

1271
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:19,680
because he found it and it is his

1272
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,050
doing his time with his knowledge or

1273
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,280
In the case of production, when the

1274
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,500
security problem can affect two

1275
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,960
people or millions of people and I

1276
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,880
can publish it, I could well then it

1277
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:33,780
seems to be public and well that will

1278
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:36,000
cause problems but the cause of the

1279
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:36,930
problem seems that there is no one that

1280
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:38,340
publishes it.  The one who made the defective software

1281
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:39,510


1282
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:41,730
is to say that obviously the company

1283
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:43,260
that used made the software of effects or to

1284
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:44,820
base that of the fault of others and nothing

1285
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:46,980
that is responsible as public this is not

1286
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:48,720
but I could designate and responsible the

1287
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,050
multivision company adrià that it sells

1288
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:54,350
defective software no

1289
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:56,780
but good it has to do with the intention is to

1290
00:54:56,780 --> 00:55:00,140
say if I publish something to make

1291
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:01,880
people bad as there is a it seems

1292
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,490
that I am  acting bad but if I publish

1293
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:05,720
something to do bad to a

1294
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,760
multivision area company so that they can handle themselves if

1295
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,890
they hurt thousands of people

1296
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:13,490
of peace it happens to you before that was incredible

1297
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:16,190
incredible the zombie talk here says that

1298
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:19,970
you love yourself and as always or be a

1299
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:22,340
Really incredible keynote in our 10 years it

1300
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:24,560
was a luxury to have you with us and

1301
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,750
we hope to meet you

1302
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:30,920
in person here or in another country

1303
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,700
again, thank you very much for the

1304
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:34,829
invitation and yes, we hope that the next one will

1305
00:55:34,829 --> 00:55:39,829
be in person as always

1306
