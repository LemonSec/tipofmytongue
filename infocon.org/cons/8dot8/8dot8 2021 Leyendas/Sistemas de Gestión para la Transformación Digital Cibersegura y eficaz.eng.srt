now in spain  At ten to two in

21
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,210
the afternoon I would have loved to

22
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,250
be there in Chile but hey, we are

23
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,410
asking for a global pandemic so

24
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,510
we have to adapt to changes, be

25
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,160
flexible, it is true, it is one of the

26
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,050
competences that the digital environment also requires of us,

27
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:32,890
so good to you  I am

28
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,080
going to go ahead with the

29
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,979
technical presentation and he

30
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:41,110
welcomed us all as they have introduced me. I

31
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,460
am susana gonzález ruiz

32
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,080
sánchez. I am right now the director of

33
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,430
the technology area.  nnovation and

34
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,410
cybersecurity in the legal axis that is

35
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,899
a risk consultancy basically in

36
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:52,899
technological legal and cybersecurity

37
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:55,670
before starting I would like

38
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,530
to tell you that one of the consequences

39
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,450
of the pandemic and digitization is

40
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,920
that we are having access to a lot

41
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,680
of training and  webinars and

42
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,689
akon cybersecurity congresses and

43
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:07,130
all subjects of all

44
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,869
characteristics and this allows us to

45
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:10,669
enjoy it from home from our

46
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:13,370
work without an added effort for

47
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,530
us, however the

48
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,510
organizational effort that leads to this type of

49
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,210
event

50
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,000
is brutal and I want  I think that in

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,590
parallel to this, the spectators

52
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,440
should at least interact together,

53
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,000
I will ask that to balance that

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,310
effort we all interact and

55
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,350
share information about this keynote

56
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,660
and all the others in our

57
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,400
social networks since well at least we

58
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,080
give it a little  more visibility to

59
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,000
that effort of the super organizers,

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,420
well today they want you  do talk about some

61
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,950
forms of phishing, most of

62
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,620
you will already know what it is, although they

63
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,150
have been among us for a long time, the truth

64
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,740
is that they have become very popular during

65
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,140
the pandemic, we are going to discuss some

66
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,730
forms of protection that we must

67
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,380
take into account based on the

68
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,030
that the vast majority of phishing attacks

69
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,250
come to us through e-

70
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,860
mail and well I'll stop something else

71
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,330
in some form of protection and

72
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,980
configuration of the most recommended e-mail

73
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,530
to minimize those risks

74
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,340
how great susana sorry how great you

75
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,750
are susana man listens to speak

76
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,360
Someone in Spanish from here had a

77
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,170
good mesh or I'm

78
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,940
sorry nothing at all

79
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,800
delighted to see you lorenzo good it costs

80
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,660
very little to lose a lot of money this is my

81
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:42,470
favorite quota in cybersecurity very

82
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,780
little time to lose a lot of money I am

83
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,980
a legal technological risk consultant

84
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,750
and security activator with

85
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,000
which everything in my life revolves around

86
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,100
identifying, assessing and establishing measures

87
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,980
of c  Technical and organizational control and

88
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,110
planning, especially because the

89
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,209
strategic part I believe that in all

90
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:01,040
business in companies but also

91
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,350
especially in cybersecurity is vital to be

92
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,000
able to implement and above all measure the

93
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,260
real effectiveness of what we are doing

94
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,550
and of the investments that are

95
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,080
When companies carry out

96
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,840
information security, the objective

97
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,280
is always to try to minimize the risk

98
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,410
in security, we always repeat,

99
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,700
actively and passively, that

100
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,680
one hundred percent security does not exist.

101
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,810


102
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,419
outsourcing

103
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:24,740
the risk is to say passing the

104
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,930
responsibility to a supplier or a

105
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,580
professional who is truly

106
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,620
responsible for doing it well

107
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,300
and believe me when I tell you that when

108
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,949
we talk about prevention rather than

109
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:36,919
reacting it is because we have a lot of

110
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:38,780
money at stake that we can lose in a

111
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,729
matter of very few  seconds we speak

112
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:42,410
of paralysis or loss of

113
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,060
production consequent with the  to loss of

114
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,610
information of sanctions that

115
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,169
the authorities of control of

116
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:50,690
personal data of economic losses may impose on us

117
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,270
because of theft of both money for access

118
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,040
to bank accounts and other frauds

119
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,750
as well as well of course consider the

120
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,790
possible reputational damages

121
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,930
I am sure the truth that the  Most of us

122
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,550
have all heard of phishing it is

123
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,620
very clear good it is a crime it is

124
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,510
a massive scam received by

125
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,400
email with generic

126
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,590
generic messages and generally because it comes

127
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,870
from an issuer that is reliable or

128
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,210
trustworthy to us, they are generally also

129
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,860
sent so that

130
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,530
users pick and share certain

131
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,300
confidential information such as

132
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,460
passwords credit card numbers

133
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,840
that they later intend to use

134
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,430
to carry out fraud, scams

135
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,380
or other criminal practices this is

136
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,850
from a point of view because it is very

137
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,620
legal generally what they do is

138
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,860
falsify some  type of campaign

139
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,120
or update  ion or some

140
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,490
promotion a raffle with the intention

141
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,490
of obtaining certain information the

142
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,020
truth is that it is usually the main

143
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,940
source of infection through

144
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,160
attachments and malicious links that

145
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,780
can infect computers through

146
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,240
Trojan ransomware or other types of

147
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,419
attacks

148
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,300
on the part of the  spirit fishing, which is a

149
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,520
bit what we wanted to get into this

150
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,680
time, is a more personalized type of fishing,

151
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,900
more worked, more specifically directed,

152
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,460
that is why it is also

153
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,050
considered

154
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,720
the most painful, let's say for

155
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,280
organizations, because it is aimed at

156
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,069
a specific organization or individual.

157
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:21,289
is to infiltrate the

158
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:22,819
organization's network to obtain

159
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:25,009
confidential information, personal data or even

160
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,500
business secrets,

161
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,180
speed fishing is classified as

162
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,670
a persistent advanced threat since we

163
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,370
remember that they

164
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,740
do not attack randomly but instead

165
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,030
seek a specific and specific objective,

166
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,990
traditionally it is not so easy

167
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,580
get the information

168
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,949
perhaps because not all are so

169
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:46,810
exposed, but what is sought is

170
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:49,000
perhaps to choose a

171
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,250
lower-ranking worker for an objective within the company who,

172
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,570
although not working directly with

173
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,280
such valuable information and who can

174
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,710
serve as a springboard or a  bridge or

175
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:59,440
connection with that other person who is

176
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,880
the one who if stealing the information of

177
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,960
true interest

178
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,470
then like the spirit without him it

179
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,539
is difficult anyone can be a

180
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:09,979
target to reach those

181
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:11,509
higher heights in the company

182
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:12,919
in order to make them  With

183
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:15,860
truly valuable information, the

184
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,660
walk in lets say that they are loyal personalized fishing,

185
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,530


186
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,360
that is, specifically directed to that

187
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,669
senior executive of a company that seeks the

188
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:24,530
greatest possible access to the

189
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,080
most sensitive and strategic information these

190
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,550
business secrets of which I

191
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,400
spoke before to the portfolio of  clients to

192
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,860
some financial strategy plans of

193
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,110
daily children designs for example of the

194
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,759
company and calls to higher levels.

195
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,820
Obviously for that same reason in the

196
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,009
spirit without the same as he is profile

197
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:44,599
and networking is also considered

198
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:47,220
a persistent threat

199
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,440
on the other hand we have the

200
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,810
bicing modality which is an attack practiced

201
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:52,970
by means of a telephone call

202
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,990
previously as in all these attacks

203
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,030
there has been a  hard work of

204
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,600
social engineering that often also results

205
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,160
in a previous phishing that has allowed

206
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,410
obtaining certain information,

207
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,310
even supplanting

208
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,200
and even taking control of

209
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,480
some systems, bicing usually comes

210
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,790
masked with telephone offers and

211
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,590
also dramatically fleeting and

212
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,210
exclusive, that is to say, it is something  that you have

213
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:18,210
to practically hire now

214
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:21,720
and as I said at the beginning, the attacker generally,

215
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,120
consistent with his

216
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,280
previous social engineering and phishing work, the

217
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,400
only thing he needs is a sms key or

218
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,560
digital token to finish carrying out

219
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,440
or validating a banking operation or an

220
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,409
online purchase is  then when

221
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:39,240
when the flame occurs  Telephone madam

222
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,770
impersonating the bank staff

223
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,240
indicating that there has been a

224
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,409
suspicious activity in your account

225
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:46,230
also indicating that what you need to

226
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,750
obtain as the sms key that has been

227
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,720
received on the mobile phone probably

228
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,290
again a touch of

229
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,660
digital smishing is the  The same modality as the

230
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,060
abyss but through the SMS of the

231
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,850
telephone text messages

232
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,250
or WhatsApp, these are

233
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,040
text messages in which the issuer

234
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,050
impersonates a bank, generally

235
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,850
saying that a suspicious purchase has been made

236
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,649
to  Usually through our

237
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:13,730
credit card

238
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,310
the message itself to

239
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:18,319
solve it requests to contact the

240
00:09:18,319 --> 00:09:19,940
bank through a false

241
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,720
phone number or through a url that

242
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,750
takes us to a fraudulent website and when calling

243
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,089
or clicking on that url we are

244
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:30,139
requested  certain

245
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:33,620
confidential information to supposedly cancel

246
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,540
the operation which is just what they are

247
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,339
looking for

248
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:40,190
well prepared some examples  that from

249
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,880
what I see they do not look

250
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:45,500
good the first one does not see

251
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,800
the second yes good I have prepared

252
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,900
some examples of the most recent as a

253
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,430
result of coronavirus because phishing attacks have known for

254
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,020
many years

255
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,550
but what I did want to convey to you

256
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,900
is that during  the pandemic, well,

257
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,180
cybercriminals have also become more

258
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,550
sophisticated and adapt to the

259
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,410
crisis situation that we are experiencing

260
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:06,200
from attachments with

261
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,150
Kobe recommendation protocols, for example, as

262
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,500
was the case with this one that is not seen,

263
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,170
that is, it was an email in

264
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:15,200
which  It was run by an entity with

265
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,390
a national corporation and

266
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,530
also trying to supplant

267
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,400
recommendations from the

268
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,070
world health organization that was the case that

269
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,930
this other example should excuse us, for

270
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:29,900
example here they are planted with the

271
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,730
general treasury of social security in Spain

272
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,470
warning of having a pending refund,

273
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,540
the truth is that it is the typical one

274
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,740
that has always thanked me very

275
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,180
much because  It usually does not usually pay, they

276
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,460
usually charge so I do not understand very

277
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,380
well how people have bitten but the

278
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,430
truth is that it has been taken ahead

279
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,070
because quite a lot of people

280
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,840
have that they would not do it because they have not

281
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,430
identified the attack

282
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,330
, however it is true that we must

283
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,010
look at  that the

284
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:54,649
critical and extreme circumstances that many people

285
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:56,210
are going through as a result of the

286
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,529
pandemic that have often requested

287
00:10:57,529 --> 00:10:59,899
aid that has not always arrived and

288
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:00,980
especially in the absence of

289
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,960
face-to-face procedures before

290
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,790
public administrations at least in

291
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,370
Spain- this is not for us  It has led us to become

292
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,959
aware of

293
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,880
digitization and familiarize

294
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,830
ourselves that things can reach us by

295
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:16,190
email medical appointments through

296
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,080
videoconferences and issues of these

297
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,750
characteristics so well this

298
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,550
has placed us all in a

299
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,100
much more unstable scenario or  more likely to

300
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,850
believe these things

301
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,149
than others, for example, like this case,

302
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:32,740
I do not know if it will be seen b  Right or wrong but hey they

303
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,649
have preferred to attack around the

304
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:38,230
vaccine, you have the opportunity to be

305
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,680
vaccinated against the cob and others have

306
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,940
supplanted

307
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,290
entertainment platforms asking for the

308
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,880
update of the payment information

309
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,350
of the account if we also look

310
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,389
during the confinements is where  There

311
00:11:49,389 --> 00:11:52,120
has been a brutal consumption of

312
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,160
entertainment at the level of movies and

313
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,980
series and others, this case, for example,

314
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,079
has also been again a

315
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:00,910
government entity, nothing less than the

316
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,350
Spanish tax agency is a body in

317
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,029
charge of managing the declaration,

318
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:06,100
collection and payment of taxes in addition

319
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,079
to sanctioning  Of course on tax issues

320
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,870
so well we see how in this case

321
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,180
also because what they tell us is that

322
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,829
practically we owe a total amount

323
00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:17,529
of almost ten thousand euros and that scares

324
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:20,680
anyone, it is difficult that

325
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,930
because people do not really think that they

326
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,490
are doing  can direct them and at

327
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,589
a certain time before this

328
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:28,540
figure well when we ask the  People

329
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,220
who ignore these types of

330
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,270
messages,

331
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,620
the truth is that they do not calm down

332
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,420
until they enter the portal to the

333
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,670
electronic headquarters of the hacienda portal to

334
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,140
verify that they really do not have

335
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,550
any notification, what

336
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:43,270
should we all do, not the truth is

337
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,730
that  When you receive it, if you don't have this

338
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,980
minimum awareness, we get scared and

339
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,600
want to know what this is about, but already

340
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,790
then,

341
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:54,430
cyber attackers also play with that with that agility

342
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:57,400
with that feeling of speed that

343
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,990
emotionally produces all of us. They received

344
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:01,150
mail these characteristics are

345
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,160
being assiduous.  also the

346
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,050
identity theft attempts of

347
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,120
banking entities, thus announcing the suspension

348
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,280
of payment peace cards or some type

349
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,310
of inclusion in black lists, for

350
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,440
example of the

351
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,660
credit or debit cards themselves, especially

352
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,100
during the confinement in which

353
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,570
purchases were increased  online and

354
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,650
even supermarkets recommended us to

355
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,170
pay with credit card  eta

356
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,390
credit or debit instead of in houses

357
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,130
by reinforcing hygiene

358
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:30,850
and security measures many of these entities

359
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:31,720
and the truth is that they have

360
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,990
conscientiously allocated very important resources

361
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,060
that is, we enter the home of the web

362
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,649
of most of  these banks

363
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:40,899
and they tell us exactly what the

364
00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:42,850
official numbers are that will never send us

365
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,319
an email of these characteristics,

366
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,569
etc., etc. However, the truth

367
00:13:46,569 --> 00:13:48,130
is that as we always say in

368
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,569
cybersecurity that the user is the

369
00:13:49,569 --> 00:13:52,149
weakest link, they continue to bite and

370
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:54,700
therefore continue to work

371
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,710
and  Well, notice that this since yesterday

372
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,960
is October 28, it is a

373
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,100
threatening warning of having received

374
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,050
an online burofax from a

375
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,090
Madrid law firm in this case the

376
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,500
funny part is that it is from the

377
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,940
legal department where almost

378
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,290
all the law firms of  lawyers that I

379
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,660
know are legal in general but well

380
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,580
I mean the emails themselves always

381
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,800
have something that can  They lead to

382
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,660
suspect that it is true that they are becoming more

383
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,370
sophisticated that now they are not only

384
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,980
using translators and therefore

385
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,540
the language calls our attention but we

386
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,960
have to look at other kinds of little things,

387
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,540
some news for example about cases

388
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,370
of fraud, the real CEO and with scams

389
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:36,460
very large amounts derived from the request

390
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,990
of the financial management to make

391
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,850
some type of payment, check to what

392
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:43,030
extent important amounts have been scammed,

393
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,529


394
00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:47,870
as in this case in which they ask you for

395
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,160
help for an

396
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,740
extremely confidential financial operation but of course

397
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,899
your boss does not have it, and  Unless you

398
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:55,759
have certain policies and

399
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:58,220
procedures, instructions and well

400
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,230
communicated within the company that in

401
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,900
some way,

402
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,000
if people apart from being aware,

403
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,470
know what to do in these

404
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,970
cases, which is sometimes as simple as

405
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,010
calling the boss or sending a  whatsapp and

406
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,990
confirm it but on other occasions in

407
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:14,260
large companies the scalability to

408
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,090
the boss is so great that  Many times

409
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,220
you do not have that trust or that

410
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,070
direct communication relationship they play with

411
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,930
it and on many occasions it is true that

412
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,520
amounts have been paid to

413
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,980
false accounts or to accounts not of any

414
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,530
provider of any

415
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:33,089
real confidential operation, very important,

416
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:35,399
the curious and frequent thing is that the

417
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,199
attackers on many occasions and thanks

418
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,699
to that previous work of

419
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:41,160
social engineering to speak a very familiar language

420
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,290
that is, they can even get to know

421
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,300
what our ways of writing

422
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,550
emails are and simulate the

423
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,430
active network style of a boss, let's not remember

424
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,230
that we are the link  weakest of

425
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,899
all this framework

426
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:57,540
here for example I put a saucepan for you

427
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,689
because it is the use of cordial and

428
00:16:00,689 --> 00:16:04,379
close language which I tell them with you

429
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:06,569
that is, they are a way of

430
00:16:06,569 --> 00:16:08,550
addressing people as very familiar so that they

431
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,610
do not clearly suspect well in

432
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,069
Currently around 90% of

433
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:15,749
cyberattacks use social engineering

434
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:17,850
is an outrage with what cu  al hay

435
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,610
reef that is to say, study our

436
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,290
habits first and also obviously

437
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,360
our weaknesses

438
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,450
and in addition to more than 70 percent

439
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:28,740
uses email

440
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:32,160
to execute exploits, violate the

441
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,230
safety of the victims and obtain

442
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:37,760
information and personal data,

443
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,389
another important piece of information is  That in Spain, of

444
00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:43,490
course, the data that I at least

445
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,190
handle only until June of this year 2020

446
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,660
were registered by the Spanish

447
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,540
data protection agency up to 847

448
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,850
security breaches that affected the leakage of

449
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,440
personal data, that is, security gaps,

450
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,230
there are many more but

451
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,519
after making the

452
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,379
weighting reports of whether or not they have affected

453
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:03,290
databases that contain personal data or

454
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,119
if they contain it in sufficient quantity

455
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:09,079
to report that gap between doubts

456
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,130
that may affect a

457
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,760
significant number of data that violate those

458
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,609
rights and  liberties of people then

459
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:20,000
only and not and it is not little '847 cases

460
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,839
until July in fact good

461
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:27,260
and here ind  It is also that there are 201

462
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,120
200 notifications and more than in the same

463
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,679
period last year, that is, the

464
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:32,179
figures always grow

465
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:35,480
exponentially, as we see,

466
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,010
detection of this type of attack or

467
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,900
fraud is very important, however sometimes it is more

468
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,440
complicated

469
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,269
because now  practically everything

470
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,039
was with mobility, not only we

471
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:45,539
received it through our

472
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,399
desktops and laptops but also

473
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,919
through the mobile and an email

474
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,539
received on the mobile usually

475
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:53,100
only shows us the name of the

476
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,080
sender and we have to do something else and

477
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,580
we have  To click to see if

478
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,080
the email address

479
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,200
may really be suspicious or not, the

480
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,759
same happens with the link that you do not want to

481
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:04,970
copy and open in the browser, that is to say

482
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:08,790
that it involves many more

483
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,800
difficulties that we must look at, obviously, it is

484
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,870
better to wait and verify  emails in

485
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,370
the office or at home and pay

486
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:17,130
full attention to those little details.

487
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,220
What little things we should see because

488
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,930
first of all we must be suspicious of

489
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,930


490
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:26,580
unknown or strange email addresses that have some

491
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,280
data that is suspicious to us,

492
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,500
most of the addresses later, well, they

493
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,990
usually carry the domain name

494
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,760
that is known to us without numbers without

495
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,070
strange letters of  the

496
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,480
spelling mistakes I already told you before that

497
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,130
it is becoming more and less common

498
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,990
but hey, it is a matter of suspecting first

499
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,940
of all the extensions of the attached files,

500
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,250
verify the link and of

501
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,540
course well to the slightest doubt

502
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,720
but

503
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,370
especially if we  ask for information

504
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,530
passwords bank details download

505
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,390
files etc to suspect and go to

506
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,860
official sources the

507
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,680
bank's application is withdrawn to the

508
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,420
electronic headquarters of the

509
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,890
government organization that assumes that something is not being

510
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:05,080
addressed and there we will verify that it

511
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,340
is truly a fraud

512
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:10,130
the problem is that the  Cybercriminals

513
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,049
have also become more sophisticated, for

514
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:13,399
example this e  s the well-known case of

515
00:19:13,399 --> 00:19:15,850
when the apple impersonation was made

516
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,500
in which man at first glance you see

517
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,179
that it really puts peru.com and

518
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:22,460
yet a lowercase l has even been substituted

519
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,230
for a capital i and in

520
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,480
certain typologies it is difficult to

521
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,000
see because  Well normally, what do we do?

522
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,769
Well, we take that url with us, we

523
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,600
change the font, we try to use

524
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,970
italic fonts and others, see if it

525
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,429
really matches or not, and we

526
00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:39,529
clearly realize that there have

527
00:19:39,529 --> 00:19:41,929
been attempts to impersonate all

528
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:43,639
these difficulties that that already

529
00:19:43,639 --> 00:19:46,850
implies.  sophistication and doubt

530
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,620
for users today we add

531
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,330
three aggravating factors that make

532
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,769
individuals still much more

533
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:53,690
vulnerable the pandemic obviously and the

534
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:56,060
extreme digitization

535
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,100
that also leads us to be

536
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,190
constantly aware of the

537
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:03,260
news that there is for us and

538
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,960
we are also quite tense  because

539
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,610
the situation is very changing in the day-

540
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:10,460
to-day teleworking, that is, that mobile

541
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,530
within our own homes to

542
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:14,570
fulfill our work obligations

543
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,970
and of course Spain and all the

544
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,560
misinformation that is occurring

545
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,880
sometimes no longer knows if what they are

546
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,320
transmitting to you is true or not if it is

547
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,490
true that there has been a

548
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,830
fraud campaign or  The real all this aggravated the

549
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:27,980
factual situation at the fishing level in

550
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,440
teleworking has led to the fact that even

551
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,630
authentic campaigns have been articulated in

552
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,900
front of the workers, there are

553
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,130
typical issues of the emails

554
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,930
that have been received, such

555
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:41,240
as the issue of

556
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,010
scheduled maintenance of the  server and interruption

557
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,570
of your access then you will only be

558
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:47,330
able to access again through the vpn if you

559
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:48,920
click here you change your password and of

560
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,230
course when a phishing is dried because

561
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:53,090
obviously they are being given information there

562
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:53,870


563
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,820
that should not be given, or you have a

564
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,430
new task or test  the new

565
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:01,400
email system and these are enter

566
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,350
here your credentials update of

567
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,910
the policy  Vacation ethics that like

568
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,350
many companies has also sent

569
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,600
people to vacations in periods of

570
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,900
confinement, well, all that

571
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,760
has been to take advantage of the

572
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,350
weakness of the situation as well as

573
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:19,389
courier delivery failures, etc.

574
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:22,320


575
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,760
strategy is always prevention and in

576
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,340
this case protection or even as

577
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,110
the best possible configuration we are

578
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,370
going to see some

579
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,650
recommendations against this type of

580
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:34,260
attacks it is recommended of course especially

581
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,640
in the organizations of the

582
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,520
strike difference to evaluate how the

583
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,320
workers act  In the face of this type of attacks,

584
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,100
mock trials are worth

585
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,039
all of us, we must also take special care, we

586
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:48,090
publish and share

587
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:49,590
any type of information

588
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,350
online on social networks because in the end, well, because it is the

589
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,210
basis on which social engineering is fed,

590
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:56,750


591
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,650
organizations must also

592
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,510
plan the implementation of

593
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:03,000
advanced security protection solutions  Security

594
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,820
in accessing information from

595
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:09,720
cloud applications such as software-as-a-service, it is

596
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,280
also important to protect

597
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,929
mobile devices against

598
00:22:12,929 --> 00:22:14,760
network attacks,

599
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,900
operating system vulnerabilities and malicious applications,

600
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,620


601
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:20,960
and since we have focused mainly

602
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,460
on the attacks received.  Through

603
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,869
email I will dwell a

604
00:22:23,869 --> 00:22:25,850
little more on some recommendations for the

605
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,499
implementation of software solutions

606
00:22:27,499 --> 00:22:29,869
and secure configuration for

607
00:22:29,869 --> 00:22:31,988
email,

608
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,450
given the increase in the use of

609
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:40,360
email as an attack vector, it has been

610
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,730
shown that implementing

611
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:45,940
technical and organizational measures to

612
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,480
verify  Authentication identity

613
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,390
is very positive to minimize that

614
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,830
number of or that risk of

615
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,580
spoofing,

616
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:00,100
so the two priorities that we

617
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,260
identify for in the protection of

618
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,850
email is, on the one hand, to

619
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:06,280
guarantee that no user is going to fall

620
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,420
into the trap of an attack.

621
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,850
spoofing through

622
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:11,770
email  e-mail and of course avoid

623
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,960
that an email that a corporate domain

624
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,780
can also be impersonated if we

625
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,070
review a little the route that

626
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,900
an email takes, we see that when it is

627
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,300
sent from a terminal the

628
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,870
outgoing or sender mail server assigns

629
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,880
a domain to it.  sends and reaches the

630
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,600
incoming server or the

631
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,730
recipient of the mail receiver, if we did not have

632
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,770
any specific configuration

633
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:38,770
or any anti-spam or any

634
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,900
authentication protocol configured, the mail

635
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,090
would enter, it would be delivered to the

636
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,070
recipient without further ado and that is where

637
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:47,130
we may have the  maximum risk,

638
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,690
fortunately we have at least

639
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,490
these three protocols that allow us to

640
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:54,070
authenticate the identity of emails by

641
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:56,590
detecting and blocking malicious or

642
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,000
spam emails before reaching the inbox

643
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,280


644
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,080
and also helps us to guarantee also

645
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,530
to the recipients that the sender  It is

646
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:10,570
legitimate we talk about the spf of the bm and

647
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:13,169
the jean marc

648
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,280
the spf is a protocol  authentication

649
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,190
of emails that what it provides us is

650
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,540
a protection against

651
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:24,600
forgeries allows us to detect which

652
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,280
server the servers have permission

653
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,710
to send emails

654
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:31,800
on our behalf its main function

655
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,120
is to prevent an

656
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,700
email from being sent from servers

657
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,770
that do not  This protocol has nothing to do with our

658
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:40,260
domain, what it does is

659
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,230
that it is defined in our and s & p

660
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:45,330
at the level

661
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,520
of the domain server name of the dns of our own

662
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,820
domain with a txt file and

663
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,740
each domain has a

664
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,380
identification number referred to an IP what we

665
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,480
achieve with this configuration is

666
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,310
that it is verified that the IP of the

667
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:01,170
device from which an

668
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:03,990
email is sent is an idea authorized to

669
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:08,150
send emails with that domain name

670
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:11,460
the decay ma in turn is a protocol of

671
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,160
Authentication figures of the sender or

672
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,010
in other words what it does is check the

673
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:18,210
authentication of the sender confirms with

674
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,430
an f  Sign a fingerprint like this when we

675
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:22,140
send an email an email

676
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,420
the sending mail server adds a

677
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,730
signature or a unique fingerprint in the

678
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:29,940
header of the mail and the

679
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,680
receiving mail server what it does is check to

680
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,690
consult that public key that has been

681
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:36,240
assigned to it  to the signature on the

682
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,100
sending mail server then if the key

683
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,950
matches the signature the mail is

684
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,140
validated as authentic the receiver

685
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,210
identifying the authenticity of the

686
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,130
sender invalidates the mail as valid

687
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:50,070
as authentic and if they do not match we can

688
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,210
conclude that the mail

689
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:53,850
has not been sent  by the person who,

690
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:56,190
by the mail server, let's say the

691
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,230
wall that appears in the header of the

692
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:01,800
mail but by an interposed

693
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,080
or fraudulent server or the mail could have

694
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,940
been modified on its way

695
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,590
because it could have been intercepted and

696
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:11,780
modified and sent again

697
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,440
what  problems we have with these two with

698
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,720
these two types of authentication is

699
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,190
protocols because on the one hand they are

700
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,289
co  Verifications that are independent,

701
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:23,960
that is, either one is done or the other is done

702
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,390
and on the other hand, they are not always configured

703
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,190
so that the receiving server can

704
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,140
make checks but the checks must

705
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,570
be done or,

706
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,610
sorry, they must be defined at the

707
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:36,610
nes level in  the sender's server, that is,

708
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:38,750
incorporated in the headers of the mail

709
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,789
that are sent, in short, if we

710
00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:43,220
do not have the spf and

711
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,960
deca and emme well configured on our server, the

712
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,850
recipient cannot verify that

713
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:48,470
our mail is legitimate and will

714
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:53,450
send it to spam  or it will deliver it in the

715
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:56,240
worst case and we also depend

716
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,309
on the provider, the information service provider,

717
00:26:58,309 --> 00:27:00,140
and the s & p to

718
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,380
verify that

719
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:06,070
spf or that of here and either of both or

720
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,810
neither and in either case

721
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:09,340
of  somehow we lose control

722
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,810
over the security of our email in

723
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,970


724
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:15,520
the end what solution can we have to

725
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,080
configure the email in

726
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,450
a more secure way an  These possible

727
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:22,270
impersonations are difficult, well,

728
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,130
the ndi marc solution is a configuration protocol for

729
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:26,200


730
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,490
email authentication that what it does is

731
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:29,890
unify the previous two of the spf and the

732
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:32,940
decay, and it allows us to define

733
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,220
that so that our mail is legitimate

734
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,470
and we are truly  Although

735
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:41,430
spf is ok check if it drops or

736
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:45,330
vice versa they are also fine then if

737
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,490
and only if both checks are

738
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,830
correct we can consider the

739
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,290
legitimate email and therefore that is ours as

740
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:55,410
well otherwise it also allows us to

741
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,990
define what to do with the emails

742
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,970
that fail  In those validations, that is,

743
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,480
we can define the pse degree of rigidity

744
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,890
in terms of the checks in such a

745
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:07,290
way that we can define parameters,

746
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:10,710
that is, accept the reception of an email

747
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,270
that has at least one of the two

748
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:15,570
protocols, the one from here and the spf

749
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,100
will require the  validations and

750
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,870
settings as correct when

751
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:21,450
receiving the mail and what must be done

752
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,070
also in the case  or that the emails do not

753
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,510
meet the parameters that we have

754
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,570
defined, that is to say, send them to quarantine,

755
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:29,280
letting them pass, eliminating them is a

756
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,530
configuration issue and also allows us to

757
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:32,970
receive reports of possible

758
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:35,100
attempts to implant

759
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,350
identity theft, in short, which

760
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:40,440
allows us to guarantee that  our

761
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,970
email our email is legitimate and

762
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,740
by extension what to do with those who

763
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,070
are not,

764
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:51,200
finally, although of course the most

765
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,180
important part of any

766
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,380
protection strategy in terms of cybersecurity

767
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,080
is the training and awareness

768
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,700
of people who interact with

769
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,500
technology  Of any characteristic, it

770
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,550
is vital that both are found that

771
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,290
they are sensitized and alert

772
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,030
to the risks and that they are also

773
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,330
aware not only of what to do

774
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:14,130
but who to address is as when

775
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,960
we speak in the organization

776
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,190
of information security strategy

777
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,810
the identification  of roles and

778
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:21,000
responsibilities many times  In a

779
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,410
contingency plan, it is important to

780
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:24,480
know how to identify what an incident is

781
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,100
and who to turn to to solve it.

782
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,690
Not necessarily all of us have to

783
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:28,940
know

784
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,740
and solve the issues because for

785
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,930
that there are the true experts and

786
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:34,280
technicians who are the ones who truly

787
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,890
know what to do in each  one of those

788
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,510
circumstances, but it is very

789
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,460
important that all of us at all levels

790
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,350
within an organization know

791
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:44,270
the responsibilities that we have, the

792
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:46,400
economic and reputational legal responsibilities

793
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,830
that suffer a cyberattack

794
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,220


795
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:56,059
and so far, thank you very much to all, it has

796
00:29:56,059 --> 00:29:58,070
been a bit what  I wanted to transmit you

797
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,580
there

798
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,540
I have a zombie

799
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,240
before

800
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:11,879
there is a moon between ships

801
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:14,990
and the question

802
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:21,530
why the years years with

803
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:24,750
contingency emphasis of the cob and of people who

804
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:27,920
have very marked them,

805
00:30:33,389 --> 00:30:38,009
you listen to me now to see if what I

806
00:30:38,009 --> 00:30:41,099
was asking you was about gpr and mime and

807
00:30:41,099 --> 00:30:44,489
prudence of these  two years is given the

808
00:30:44,489 --> 00:30:46,919
current influence of cumin given the

809
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:50,490
current contingency of the

810
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:54,480
As an influence, basically being

811
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,250
living in this pandemic has had a

812
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:57,840
positive or

813
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,240
negative influence on the compliance of pr.

814
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,860
Okay,

815
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:06,520
I understand that positively for me

816
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,650
that I dedicate myself to that, among other things, to

817
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:10,750
data protection and information security

818
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:13,300
because because the  People have

819
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,760
seen them have seen themselves more vulnerable and I

820
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,810
think they have begun to give more

821
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:20,920
importance to their personal information I

822
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,810
think that the one who has the most or the least I

823
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:25,510
remember in 2017 when the

824
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,430
wanna cry attack that

825
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:29,230
began worldwide  to talk a bit about

826
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,430
ransomware and people started to get

827
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,200
familiar with this, not the same

828
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,390
if there is a regulation that suddenly

829
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,610
reaches May 2018 and the only thing that people

830
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,350
knew was the number of

831
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,060
emails they received trying to

832
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,160
renew with feelings  But they did not know

833
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,960
very well why not what happens

834
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,390
when you really see your data

835
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:49,570
exposed or have some kind of attack

836
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:52,600
on your company or on your own device.  It

837
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,720
is unfortunately when you realize

838
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,060
that I believe that the cob and what it has done

839
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,670
has been to popularize the attacks,

840
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,740
popularize the scams in many

841
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,360
ways and to whom the most since the least has

842
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,760
reached it and I think it has been positive

843
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,530
because at least the  It sounds like people

844
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:10,330
have rights to claim

845
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,679
that was also causing

846
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,149
companies to start taking things

847
00:32:13,149 --> 00:32:16,860
a little more seriously

848
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,000
yes that is my mission I think it is

849
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,429
favorable it is unfortunate

850
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,540
now again I do not listen to you

851
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,250
and now I do apologize now  If it was

852
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:51,940
global, it was like this the prevention

853
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:54,100
or mitigation measure that was indicated in the

854
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,140
presentation are legal requirements in

855
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:00,210
Spain or the European Union not the

856
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:03,250
good gdr to see at the European level what we

857
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,080
have is quite a bit

858
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,700
of information security regulations because it comes out

859
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,710
practically  In a transversal way, as it

860
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:11,770
should be in other regulations, it is valid and of

861
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:13,690
course the most

862
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,280
first-level matrix standard is the gdr, which is the

863
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,230
data protection regulation, this is

864
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,360
not  rma which I love because it is

865
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,190
very flexible, that is, before at least in

866
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,750
Spain- other countries of the union did not

867
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,130
have data protection regulations

868
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:27,250
and others did, but they had it

869
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:30,970
more up-to-date, they spoke

870
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,400
of the first automated data and it is

871
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,690
It is true that in Spain we already had a

872
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:36,700
fairly good pioneering regulation,

873
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,790
but it was protectionist to understand,

874
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,650
they told me for high-level data and they

875
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:43,150
told you what we know about high-level data,

876
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,620
we have to take these

877
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:47,559
high-level technical and organizational measures

878
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:50,529
and so on with medium-level data.  under etc and that

879
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:53,620
the gpr has done and has established what is

880
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:56,379
called accounting and the principle of

881
00:33:56,379 --> 00:33:57,970
proactive responsibility of

882
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,529
companies that is, each one has to

883
00:33:59,529 --> 00:34:02,320
measure their risks, it is worth analyzing the

884
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,970
risks of the data processing that

885
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:06,340
you carry out and based on it  decide

886
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,349
what are the security measures that

887
00:34:08,349 --> 00:34:10,750
you consider appropriate in a

888
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,480
responsible way with this I mean

889
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,969
that within itself it is true  that

890
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:17,859
after hours the control authorities of

891
00:34:17,859 --> 00:34:20,409
ours and other European countries have been

892
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:22,060
making recommendations, so what

893
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,230
happens when you have

894
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,300
especially sensitive data that

895
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,770
the regulation also tells you what

896
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,540
health data can be like now,

897
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,399
for example in companies that  Before they did not process

898
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,230
data from special categories,

899
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:34,149
now they are treating us because they are

900
00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:35,199
taking the temperature of their

901
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,109
workers, to give an example, it

902
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:39,609
is not valid because that treatment of this type

903
00:34:39,609 --> 00:34:41,409
of data is somewhat more sensitive, they are more

904
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:43,469
sensitive with respect to merely identifying data, they

905
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:45,609
require

906
00:34:45,609 --> 00:34:47,319
special measures that already exist.  Well

907
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:50,130
, encryption type recommendations etc

908
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,139
the recommendations that we have given

909
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:54,449
here regarding email could be

910
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:57,480
considered as those recommended

911
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,130
because they are not required there is a catalog

912
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,350
that they tell you to protect the

913
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,090
minimum email you have to have is

914
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:04,770
because as I say the rule is flexible

915
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,400


916
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,740
a hair is also not the same  I wanted an

917
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,140
industry to be talking about

918
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,760
operational safety then they

919
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,589
could not legislate for everything or they would

920
00:35:14,589 --> 00:35:16,539
legislate for a very short period of time

921
00:35:16,539 --> 00:35:18,220
in this way because it makes everyone

922
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,950
look yes that it is true that obviously

923
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:23,740
everything that could involve an attack

924
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,240
through  of email that can

925
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,760
endanger databases you do not know

926
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,099
how maybe sql injection attacks

927
00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:33,190
to the forms of a website

928
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,450
that is, you can take a lot of

929
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:36,579
data if you do not have it well secured

930
00:35:36,579 --> 00:35:38,529
so obviously I consider it a

931
00:35:38,529 --> 00:35:40,750
Fundamental measure because you are

932
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:43,539
protecting the personal information that

933
00:35:43,539 --> 00:35:45,940
you can deal with about the company, then

934
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,339
you also protect critical information

935
00:35:48,339 --> 00:35:51,579
sensitive business financial

936
00:35:51,579 --> 00:35:55,359
flat maps of designs etc. etc. that

937
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,339
do not carry personal information but

938
00:35:57,339 --> 00:35:58,930
that in the hands of the competition can

939
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,970
do you a lot of harm as a company but

940
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:02,740
basically  To comply with the regulations, I

941
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,809
believe that they are measures, there is the issue

942
00:36:04,809 --> 00:36:06,339
of confidence.  guration of the mail in addition to

943
00:36:06,339 --> 00:36:08,030
helping us

944
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:11,510
to prevent them from being impersonated

945
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,610
or being accessed through phishing,

946
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:16,420
preventing as much as possible

947
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:19,510
will help us a lot to comply as a

948
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:23,260
security control of the

949
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:26,920
personal data protection regulations excellent,

950
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,680
thank you very much susana  Very

951
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,600
clarifying, tuqui, not really for

952
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,300
us the most technical ones we always do not

953
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,800
need to know this type of

954
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,930
regulation and how they look from the point

955
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:39,870
of view of a lawyer specialized in

956
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:42,520
cybersecurity in computer science so

957
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,440
thank you very much for your presentation by

958
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,870
your kirkuk and also  because there is also

959
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:50,350
a need for more women in this area and

960
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,820
we hope that in the near future you

961
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:54,640
can visit Chile and be able to be with

962
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,100
us here in person now

963
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,950
that I would love to have them

964
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:02,030
thank you very much

965
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:04,460
thank you thank you for your support and time and

966
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,290
we are going  a small room is waiting

967
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,490
because it is already prepared in our

968
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:09,260
next exhibitor and a

969
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,970
Hispanic legend that  He is also going to present it

970
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:15,220
so don't die from your seat.

971
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,480
Let's go
