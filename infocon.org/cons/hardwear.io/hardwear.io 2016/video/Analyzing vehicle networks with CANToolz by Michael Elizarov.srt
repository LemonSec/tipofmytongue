1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:13,019
hello well everybody's<font color="#E5E5E5"> here me great I'd</font>

2
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:15,509
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you about my team about</font>

3
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:18,990
candles and about go hiking I know

4
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:24,448
that's you so many car hiking stuff

5
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:26,929
today and yesterday and I try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show</font>

6
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:32,189
you some demonstration not just

7
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:37,589
theoretical stuff so my team contains

8
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:42,170
contains now 15 members but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main</font>

9
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:45,420
members you could see in that slide so

10
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:48,350
contours writer is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alex essence of and</font>

11
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:51,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">Sergey cannon Inca and they're made</font>

12
00:00:48,350 --> 00:01:00,000
really really hard work which<font color="#E5E5E5"> helped us</font>

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:01:02,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">to hack course so if you like to go</font>

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">Moscow come to the our conventions</font>

15
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:12,450
they're nice and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Paige days or our live</font>

16
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:16,140
con meeting so it's some theoretical

17
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:19,999
stuff I wouldn't like to tell you about

18
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:24,840
it because you know all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff so</font>

19
00:01:19,999 --> 00:01:28,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">how we found our first can bus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its was</font>

20
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:35,310
in an opt-in honda civic ninth

21
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:38,539
generation and we saw some packages

22
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:45,030
about what happening in cars or<font color="#CCCCCC"> RPM</font>

23
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:49,969
engine turn on row for some temperature

24
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:54,649
and so on and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i couldn't manipulate that</font>

25
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:57,839
traffic because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just give your</font>

26
00:01:54,649 --> 00:02:00,420
possibilities to read the traffic and if

27
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:06,299
you send some special commands the

28
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:11,070
gateway will open you viral and you

29
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:14,130
could send<font color="#CCCCCC"> some traffic but it's not</font>

30
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:17,160
interesting so

31
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:20,780
here's a engine control unit which is so

32
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:24,859
in our car and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's of course it has</font>

33
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:27,780
canvas but not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only can it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has other</font>

34
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:33,690
bosses but we are now constraint it on

35
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:35,880
cam so it's some theoretical stuff here

36
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:40,280
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could see that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> connected to</font>

37
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:45,620
converse<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a immobilizer system and</font>

38
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:49,710
from this we could open closed curve

39
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:54,120
open<font color="#E5E5E5"> closed windows see the statement of</font>

40
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:57,990
media system and so on well how could we

41
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:01,350
connect to the can we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it</font>

42
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:03,690
which with with many hardware stuff but

43
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:06,630
we choose is between it's open source

44
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:15,480
and you could see PCB and other

45
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:17,670
information in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> site so today I'll</font>

46
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:22,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit later some</font>

47
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:31,350
demonstration and I use for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to use</font>

48
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:34,680
between connected in a loop so to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

49
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:40,620
it to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> this networker close we</font>

50
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:48,959
should use these two pins which enabling

51
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:53,370
the 120 ohms resistance one moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

52
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:57,810
our controls is a graphical well the

53
00:03:53,370 --> 00:04:00,390
graphical part is just maybe poke for

54
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:05,910
demonstration how could you could use

55
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:09,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's also have a p.i and you could</font>

56
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:12,000
control traffic over the terminal if you

57
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:15,590
like but i prefer buttons because it's

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:21,238
easier and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's you could understand</font>

59
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:23,870
much when you're see things so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'd like</font>

60
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:28,609
to show you<font color="#E5E5E5"> the video from the ph days</font>

61
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:34,140
which were made in<font color="#E5E5E5"> moscow in</font>

62
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:38,040
last May so we get our car in a ground

63
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:41,070
floor<font color="#E5E5E5"> and give people possibilities to</font>

64
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:48,200
hack our BMW 5<font color="#CCCCCC"> Series and it was really</font>

65
00:04:41,070 --> 00:05:11,310
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> also we show how to use our</font>

66
00:04:48,200 --> 00:05:14,580
candles one moment yeah so how<font color="#E5E5E5"> could you</font>

67
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:18,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">could see ah were we could man plate</font>

68
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:23,669
lights windows in a little while yeah

69
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:25,590
and other stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> trunk and so on also the</font>

70
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:31,190
current Gina turned off because we

71
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:35,219
couldn't activate it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a conference and</font>

72
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:38,370
it's all made by controls our canvas and

73
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:42,480
youth<font color="#CCCCCC"> beating and it's for now it's</font>

74
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:46,650
controlled wireless so we connected our

75
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:48,540
is between two<font color="#E5E5E5"> Raspberry Pi and after</font>

76
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:55,679
that raspberry connected to our Wi-Fi

77
00:05:48,540 --> 00:06:00,510
network so I'd some remotely stuff also

78
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:07,980
it's made with some music so we create

79
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:12,530
new model for candles to use MIDI

80
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:16,350
commands which are activating the exact

81
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:21,929
can packages and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going into the</font>

82
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:28,020
canvas so we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> music and our MIDI</font>

83
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:29,940
commands so me after the conference how

84
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:33,469
you think you could see the whole video

85
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:37,880
with the sounds and there are music with

86
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:37,880
blinking and other

87
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:10,380
well in<font color="#E5E5E5"> candles we have many models and</font>

88
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:12,810
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> could use fuzzing we could unless we</font>

89
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:16,680
could damn traffic we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> replace a</font>

90
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:21,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">fig we could find exact packages</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

91
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:23,580
which we need to reply to for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

92
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:30,450
close the door open the<font color="#E5E5E5"> door activate</font>

93
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:34,460
the alarm or disable the alarm and so on

94
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:38,550
so how I say it's have GUI and it's

95
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:40,979
worked by little Python server so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

96
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:46,250
could connect<font color="#CCCCCC"> two controls over the web</font>

97
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:53,100
and the controls is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> made in a Python</font>

98
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:57,480
well it's not interesting stuff one

99
00:07:53,100 --> 00:08:04,490
moment well and the most helpful stuff

100
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:04,490
for us that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't just our writing</font>

101
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:18,330
the numbers we understanding the

102
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:23,250
statement of packages which oh well one

103
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:28,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">moment yeah we see how which part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

104
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:32,549
package is a ID number which is a exact

105
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:40,350
command and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we see how</font>

106
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:45,800
frequently are some bites are in package

107
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:50,670
and we could understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the one</font>

108
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:55,949
that for example that<font color="#E5E5E5"> side</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its ID number</font>

109
00:08:50,670 --> 00:09:01,199
and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is command and this another</font>

110
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:08,540
stuff so we could write<font color="#CCCCCC"> our dumps in a</font>

111
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:16,170
readable format for safe exact package

112
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:19,219
yeah so and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

113
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:46,170
some demonstration how exactly the

114
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:52,020
candles works one month well as mentor

115
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:57,540
is just how i<font color="#E5E5E5"> started the candles I used</font>

116
00:09:52,020 --> 00:10:00,510
the models an example and just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

117
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:05,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit change it for demonstration so all</font>

118
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:05,030
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I needed is just a web browser</font>

119
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:34,010
no my<font color="#E5E5E5"> aunt yeah here you see to running</font>

120
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:36,140
can tell servers so it's one for our

121
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:41,060
first kiss between and second for second

122
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:44,240
so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll i'll reply from one is</font>

123
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:47,979
between to another sniffed traffic from

124
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:52,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">the BMW and we have two traffic's</font>

125
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:56,030
traffic of noise so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we just connect it</font>

126
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:59,060
to canvas don't do anything maybe just

127
00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:04,310
turn on engine for example and no<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

128
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:07,089
and read the packages till the five or

129
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:10,900
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes so we collecting the</font>

130
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:16,090
packages of sensors and other car stuff

131
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:20,360
without actions and after that we should

132
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:24,290
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> the exact package for example for</font>

133
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:27,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">closing the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> door and it's one package</font>

134
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:32,030
and in a car<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a maybe minute you could</font>

135
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:34,880
get thousands of packages so how to find

136
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:37,270
exact package what we need well<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll</font>

137
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,270
show you

138
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:06,589
once

139
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:26,109
why don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all started because they</font>

140
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:26,109
use between are connected wrong

141
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:21,939
yeah now both of them are studied so I

142
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:25,599
couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see well let's make one of the</font>

143
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:29,830
use between is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> car I'm later and</font>

144
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:34,060
another they normally use between so

145
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:42,340
first of all we should upload the damn

146
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:52,239
traffic in our first in our first

147
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:56,850
controls<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you see that is</font>

148
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,850
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay oh okay</font>

149
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:18,450
so now I getting some noise traffic a

150
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:22,500
and it contains seven thousand ten more

151
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:27,460
100 packages and after that I just

152
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:31,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to reply it but I decreases not</font>

153
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:39,280
degrees now licorice delay because it

154
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:59,099
could take some moment so we're playing

155
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:59,100
it and play and it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> replying</font>

156
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:35,489
oh my<font color="#E5E5E5"> god my computer couldn't do it big</font>

157
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:35,490
screen 1mon yourself he<font color="#E5E5E5"> has some blacks</font>

158
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:48,880
well it's now a plane but how you could

159
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:48,880
see it's the second don't see now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

160
00:17:39,769 --> 00:17:44,639
well unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't work I</font>

161
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:51,320
don't know why maybe some wires are

162
00:17:44,639 --> 00:17:54,119
broken here<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it looks like okay well</font>

163
00:17:51,320 --> 00:18:04,999
if I couldn't do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> that way I could</font>

164
00:17:54,119 --> 00:18:04,999
just add add it in a buffer one moment

165
00:18:26,749 --> 00:18:31,470
yeah but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like to show one moment</font>

166
00:18:29,249 --> 00:18:34,099
I I know that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> working I done it</font>

167
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,099
five minutes ago

168
00:19:33,890 --> 00:20:10,110
yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's a problem with my</font>

169
00:19:36,210 --> 00:20:17,240
wires cuz just wrote me well now I just

170
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:17,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">load data which i like to send</font>

171
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,710
you

172
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:57,620
you

173
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:04,610
well I think it's better to<font color="#CCCCCC"> give me five</font>

174
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:08,050
minutes and let's take some rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

175
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:08,050
five minutes and I show you

176
00:23:46,370 --> 00:24:13,590
I think I

177
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:16,620
screenshot from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> testing because I</font>

178
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:21,689
could enjoy it now understand twice or

179
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:23,850
going wrong well let's continue so we

180
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:25,799
could see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that side connected they used</font>

181
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:28,709
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use betweens by three wires and I</font>

182
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:31,049
think it's now exactly why it's not

183
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:34,380
working well it's a connecting by the

184
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:37,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">Khan hike on low and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ground one so</font>

185
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:41,850
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I just loaded the packages</font>

186
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:45,919
like you so end reply to the another use

187
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:49,949
between and you could see that one month

188
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:53,690
here are you see some<font color="#E5E5E5"> sniffed packages</font>

189
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:57,540
when you are pushing current status so

190
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:59,580
it's how the use between<font color="#CCCCCC"> working and how</font>

191
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:01,379
they can tools working so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just</font>

192
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:04,409
connect into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> canvas in the car and</font>

193
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:07,440
see sniffs packages but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

194
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:19,350
the frequency of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the canvas so it's a</font>

195
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:24,510
most time it's a 500<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hertz so here you</font>

196
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:28,620
could see differences between<font color="#CCCCCC"> our dump</font>

197
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:32,240
of noise<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the damp of the local</font>

198
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:36,570
action so when you're putting the on

199
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:39,750
button to lock doors there are many many

200
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:42,210
packages when in new packages will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in</font>

201
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:46,169
the car but we need exact the one

202
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:51,540
package which are closing the door so

203
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:58,169
here we could see some or PM packages it

204
00:25:51,540 --> 00:26:03,649
shows us how much or PM<font color="#CCCCCC"> your engine have</font>

205
00:25:58,169 --> 00:26:06,410
in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> moment and many many other</font>

206
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:09,410
packages of for example temperature or

207
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:09,410
other

208
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:25,190
so here we could see the using

209
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:32,570
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ma when you're choosing</font>

210
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:32,570
packages which are which we could see

211
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:43,230
less times than the RPM so now we could

212
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:47,669
see our exact package which are closing

213
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:52,560
the door and the length<font color="#CCCCCC"> the packages</font>

214
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:57,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">which sure maybe giving some temperature</font>

215
00:26:52,560 --> 00:27:12,389
information and other stuff what we

216
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:18,960
don't need to one moment so<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we see</font>

217
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:26,160
are the messages which are sent with

218
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:28,950
that ID code so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could get all the</font>

219
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:34,400
package and understand which messages

220
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:39,420
will you did you get so when you have

221
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:44,810
many thousands of packages you just use

222
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:44,810
our search and see<font color="#E5E5E5"> exact what you want</font>

223
00:27:46,460 --> 00:28:02,040
one month well here you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in this</font>

224
00:27:55,710 --> 00:28:07,640
output you'll see the changes in that

225
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:07,639
packages in that package exact that so

226
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:12,080
mmm

227
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:15,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">good understand what has happened</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

228
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:19,760
that sensor for example if it changed or

229
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:22,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">not and how does it changed so you could</font>

230
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:26,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">say that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its statement of for example</font>

231
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:31,668
doors and you see that oh it was closed

232
00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:39,830
it was open or it will call think it was

233
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:44,179
in process of closing for example not

234
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:51,439
interesting one<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment oh and here we</font>

235
00:28:44,179 --> 00:28:56,230
are using the search by ID and getting

236
00:28:51,440 --> 00:29:00,620
the messages from the RPM so we could

237
00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:08,590
understand which<font color="#E5E5E5"> RPM was in a car when</font>

238
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:14,239
your damping the traffic so and here our

239
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:18,709
package which show us that we sent that

240
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:21,230
comment with this message to close the

241
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:24,559
door<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we need to make its</font>

242
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:31,490
find the differences and between the

243
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:35,960
first and second buffers and get the one

244
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:38,990
exactly package so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should say the</font>

245
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:47,470
control<font color="#CCCCCC"> set we need just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one action to</font>

246
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:54,980
find our packet well and here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could</font>

247
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:59,539
see the differences after we pressed the

248
00:29:54,980 --> 00:30:03,169
button so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could watch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> activity of car</font>

249
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:07,690
what is done after we<font color="#E5E5E5"> make so which</font>

250
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:16,830
sensors are activated or which are

251
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:22,440
changed things and other other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

252
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:26,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll lose the same well I think it's all</font>

253
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:28,890
main things and if you like I could if

00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:39,689
fix it and show you know I think 10

257
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:42,570
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's all main things what I'd</font>

258
00:30:39,690 --> 00:31:01,549

260
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:18,928
thanks Michael so did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see any</font>

261
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:21,330
security features on the bus system that

262
00:31:18,929 --> 00:31:23,429
prevent basic like this injection type

263
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:27,059
of attacks or like aware<font color="#E5E5E5"> of anything in</font>

264
00:31:23,429 --> 00:31:30,450
that direction please could<font color="#E5E5E5"> you hold</font>

265
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:32,220
this way I audience<font color="#CCCCCC"> hear you oh so are</font>

266
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:34,139
you aware of any countermeasures like on

267
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:36,179
the bus on filtering path segments or

268
00:31:34,139 --> 00:31:41,100
any like<font color="#CCCCCC"> five volt type aspect so can</font>

269
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:44,820
you yes about that we see it and we know

270
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:48,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the car have not one can Network</font>

271
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:51,629
have more than one its 01 for example

272
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:54,419
for the engine system another<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

273
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:59,940
media system and maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> another for other</font>

274
00:31:54,419 --> 00:32:03,260
stuff so we have many ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go from</font>

275
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:05,820
one network to another but it's

276
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:08,429
searching it's about searching

277
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:11,490
vulnerabilities and finding some<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

278
00:32:08,429 --> 00:32:15,750
code execution stuff in the federal

279
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:20,130
system so which you was in we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should see</font>

280
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:24,570
in video it's connected the<font color="#CCCCCC"> use between</font>

281
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:26,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">connected to the network in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the mirror</font>

282
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:30,240
system so the manual system connected to

283
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:32,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">the elite's to the windows and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

284
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for example but we couldn't</font>

285
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:37,410
manipulate from that<font color="#E5E5E5"> network to engine</font>

286
00:32:35,429 --> 00:32:42,059
we could stall the engine but we

287
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:49,650
couldn't send direct messages we just

288
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:51,389
could make some<font color="#CCCCCC"> dose so is it more</font>

289
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:53,100
filtering or is it some of the

290
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:56,550
authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> so can you say something</font>

291
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:59,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">about that I know that's the packages</font>

292
00:32:56,550 --> 00:33:02,240
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> obd is of about filtering so</font>

293
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:05,460
when you are connected to obd it's a

294
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,710
filtered by far wall so you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

get information about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a car and if</font>

296
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:14,460
you're after is a authorizing in a viral

297
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:21,270

305
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:43,309
authentication you explained and well I

306
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:45,899
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's there are many programs so</font>

307
00:33:43,309 --> 00:33:52,860
some of them open source some of them

308
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:56,700
