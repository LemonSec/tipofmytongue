5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:20,850
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> get started right so who are we my</font>

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,970
name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Xavier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a harbor security</font>

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:27,510
specialist I work at code white as a

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,698
broad security engineer so you know we

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,820
break stuff and have some fun I'm from

10
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,800
cadiz spain just the south that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:39,390
have a BBQ n stuff you know south of us

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:42,599
rules yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I enjoyed a reversing product</font>

13
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,820
so i<font color="#E5E5E5"> always want to make stuff to what i</font>

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,450
want them to do not what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are</font>

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:50,250
supposed to do and yeah I like cake when

16
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:54,660
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lie I'm barbecues like I said</font>

17
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:58,410
are you my name is<font color="#E5E5E5"> henrik fairy not</font>

18
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:01,589
nurture<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am a hardware security guy i</font>

19
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:05,459
also work at Ko whites and I do like

20
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:07,140
reverse engineering a lot i also like

21
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,759
attacking software systems but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the art</font>

22
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,090
website I think it's a little bit more

23
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:18,000
fun i also like lasers that's me with

24
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:20,130
the laser right there yeah so he likes

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,280
barbecue is over cake I stick to explain

26
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:25,798
yeah sure so yeah let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

27
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,280
bit briefing<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tasha about the Korean car</font>

28
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:32,280
hacking status so yeah most of right

29
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,040
nows more on the remote part we could

30
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,409
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting to get there but most of</font>

31
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,270
the focus is on the campus itself so

32
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:40,979
yeah they're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we play attacks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

33
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">packing injection which is like this</font>

34
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:46,950
small phone we have their leg record

35
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,110
yourself and like play some researchers

36
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,820
also found some<font color="#CCCCCC"> remotest products to</font>

37
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,310
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> control of certain vehicles or</font>

38
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:56,880
parts of it actually there was one not

39
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:59,549
too long ago and<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah there are some</font>

40
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,860
tools which are pretty useful to help us

41
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:07,580
understand the UDS protocol

42
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:09,440
but the camp bus you know it's like like

43
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,990
only the transport layer or even a

44
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,970
little bit lower and the protocols on

45
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:17,480
top of them are<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting as</font>

46
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:20,030
well because you might have heard UDS or

47
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,950
TP 2.0 just short for a tunneling

48
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:24,050
protocol they also take<font color="#E5E5E5"> place on the</font>

49
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:26,420
campus but they do offer a lot of

50
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:30,080
interesting services from an attackers

51
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:32,959
point of view they're like use for

52
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,690
servicing vehicles that's like the first

53
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,870
use case you would think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of but you can</font>

54
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:40,130
also do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff as well</font>

55
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:42,260
yeah like<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I will know that</font>

56
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:44,390
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> bognor abilities are related</font>

57
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,220
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the firmware versions so one of the</font>

58
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,079
samples<font color="#E5E5E5"> with these services you can</font>

59
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,209
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gather</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the information</font>

60
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,080
from the software<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> AC use you</font>

61
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:56,000
can attempt to read the finger from them

62
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,820
like trigger actions which are not so

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,500
obvious initiative so there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

64
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:05,570
fun to play with and yeah to get started

65
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's UDS so yeah you DSS stands for</font>

66
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:09,859
unified diagnostic service and its

67
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:12,890
present in pretty much all modern cars

68
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:15,440
it provides access to the services<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

69
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:17,179
basis because easy use our servers I

70
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,640
mean when you are connecting to an ECU

71
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:23,300
to our client accessing the server

72
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:25,579
services or the services so yeah it

73
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:30,980
takes place on top of the can<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol</font>

74
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:33,769
so it's a layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 and EDS arrows to</font>

75
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:37,369
perform transmissions so to send

76
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:38,840
messages of up to 256 bytes that's

77
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:41,690
because the length is a specified a

78
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,340
single bite so and it is just a

79
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:45,290
transport protocol I mean the name

80
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:48,230
itself is sort of misleading because

81
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:50,870
it's like a Diagnostics service but it

82
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:53,950
is just a transport pod also you can put

83
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:58,099
any data on it

84
00:03:53,950 --> 00:04:01,099
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll es you know like a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can frame</font>

85
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:03,069
can hold up to an 8 x payload and UTS

86
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:05,480
helps with like fragmenting the

87
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:08,328
transmissions so there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a single frame</font>

88
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:11,599
transmission and you can stuff like

89
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:13,519
seven<font color="#E5E5E5"> bytes in there or less and then</font>

90
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,099
there's multiple frames transmissions

91
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,048
which means your payload is bigger than

92
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,570
seven bytes and it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> hecht up into</font>

93
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:22,849
different pieces different<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

94
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:24,409
frames yeah yeah so to get it the other

95
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:26,720
way around four or if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send</font>

96
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:29,449
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than seven bytes in the payload you</font>

97
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:33,229
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> require more than one canvas frame</font>

98
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:36,440
to send the whole message and yeah what

99
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:38,870
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of frames</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> assists in EDS so does</font>

100
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,210
not that many<font color="#CCCCCC"> tirst like without a Greek</font>

101
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,070
west part of a multi for<font color="#E5E5E5"> in transmission</font>

102
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:46,280
that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the message is more than</font>

103
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:49,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">seven bytes long so there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are no otra</font>

104
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:52,130
vez is obvious so the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing but</font>

105
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:54,020
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> ag</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> request they only thing that</font>

106
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:55,699
changes is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the</font>

107
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">transmission of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the all transmission and</font>

108
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:59,510
then on every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> frame there will be</font>

109
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:01,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">always the first byte which is</font>

110
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:05,630
consecutive to follow up just in case

111
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:07,760
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> serb or decline misses a frame then</font>

112
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:12,469
there's like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single frame which the</font>

113
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:14,419
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> byte is 0 1 0 0 plus the length so</font>

114
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:18,320
if the length of the pillows three bites

115
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:20,659
it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 3 whatever app which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

116
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,110
single bite 30 and the anak<font color="#CCCCCC"> reproduce</font>

117
00:05:20,659 --> 00:05:29,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">mission is a think 90 or 95 or something</font>

118
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:32,389
then it was lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> during the slides so TP</font>

119
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:35,389
2.0 already mentioned since for

120
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:37,190
tunneling protocol and it's also present

121
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:40,159
in some issues like depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

122
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:42,949
manufacturer they like prefer TP 2.0 for

123
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:45,289
this stuff and it's also used for

124
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:47,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">internal communication I mean keep in</font>

125
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:49,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">mind they like make it very easy for you</font>

126
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,380
to split<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to send more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than seven or</font>

127
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:54,109
eight bytes in a can frame so that's why

128
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:56,210
they're yours it used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a part for</font>

129
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:59,840
the Kaline protocol like that's like the

130
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:03,440
predecessor of TP 2.0 so to say and as

131
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,659
again it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a transport protocol so</font>

132
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,150
it takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> them like takes</font>

133
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,370
are placed<font color="#E5E5E5"> on top of the can protocol</font>

134
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:14,840
itself and it allows you to perform

135
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:17,780
transmission up to 256 bytes so<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

136
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:21,890
it's pretty similar to<font color="#E5E5E5"> UDS it's just</font>

137
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:24,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">like there are some how to say it some</font>

138
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:26,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">op codes that are different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

139
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:29,780
structure<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a little bit different so</font>

140
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,340
yeah again pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same there</font>

141
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,440
are two kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of transmission single</font>

142
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:36,380
foreign transmissions but here we can

143
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,260
only put five bytes of payload on a

144
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:41,480
single frame if so if we have five by a

145
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:43,789
bite or less we only need a<font color="#CCCCCC"> calm frame</font>

146
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,890
if we have more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than five we need to use</font>

147
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:49,640
more than one<font color="#E5E5E5"> confirm to transmit the</font>

148
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:51,229
data and again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not gonna go through</font>

149
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:58,280
the whole thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> but so you see how</font>

150
00:06:51,230 --> 00:07:00,470
similar they are yes Google so same

151
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:04,070
operations just some calls like the act

152
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:07,630
was like 30 or new dsus be 0 but in the

153
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:12,349
end it's pretty much the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing and</font>

154
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:15,650
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> DSA DS you can see that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> naming</font>

155
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:18,350
schema it's a little bit unsharp it's

156
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,419
you know the names are different but the

157
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,520
main difference is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the asid the</font>

158
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:27,350
service ID codes you can see on the

159
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:30,560
second left column yeah yeah so I do you

160
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:33,770
see like the two columns I'll go walk on

161
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:37,010
it on this column here you see something

162
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:40,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">sis's I do have a laser pointer Wow such</font>

163
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:42,140
technology man so you can see here

164
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:44,450
that's actually like two columns in one

165
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:46,159
so what you see I guess you don't see

166
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:50,060
the bodies but when you see two values

167
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,770
it means that UDS<font color="#E5E5E5"> and KW p which is</font>

168
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,390
pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> done in protocol have</font>

169
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,370
different necessities but some are

170
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:57,320
shared so that's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the main</font>

171
00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:02,630
differences between tunneling protocol

172
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:04,280
and UDS so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a couple of</font>

173
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:06,560
services which we would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention</font>

174
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:09,049
here that are interesting from an

175
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,090
tickets point of view the first is like

176
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:14,330
the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> access which is the</font>

177
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:17,989
authentication from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tester to the</font>

178
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:18,568
ECU so that's like the authentication

179
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,339
and

180
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:22,409
you need to have security access to

181
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:26,969
access like services that to write

182
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:28,558
operations or are like more critical and

183
00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:30,509
then there's read memory by address

184
00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:33,180
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty self-explanatory it</font>

185
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:34,889
allows you to read memory addresses like

186
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:37,919
you give it an offset and it will return

187
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:40,729
the data reads or writes data by ID

188
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,500
means that there are already certain

189
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:46,440
values that are known for example you

190
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:49,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">can use an ID to read the vehicle</font>

191
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:52,440
identification number but there's also

192
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:54,630
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> other stuff to trigger now request</font>

193
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,920
upload is used to retrieve the firmware

194
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:58,589
from the ECU it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

195
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,560
misleading here that means like these

196
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:04,800
you is supposed to upload the firmware

197
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:07,469
to the tester to the PC and routine

198
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,959
control cancer like routines which take

199
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:12,089
a little bit longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example</font>

200
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:15,540
resetting the issue or<font color="#E5E5E5"> arising the flesh</font>

201
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:20,100
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> some other fun ones which are like</font>

202
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:21,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">depending on the bender so yeah with all</font>

203
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,509
this stuff so say hello<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

204
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:26,550
comebacker that's a little guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

205
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:30,209
glitches gonna glitch just for someone

206
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:33,420
special so let's talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

207
00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:36,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">Commodore now we after this intro it's</font>

208
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:40,589
powered by<font color="#E5E5E5"> an embed OPC</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 70-68 or an LPC</font>

209
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:43,980
espresso 1769 the latter has debugger

210
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:46,829
embedded on it it has 128 kilobytes of

211
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:50,490
external RAM it has to db9 can

212
00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:53,638
interfaces plus<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2d but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Raiders it has an</font>

213
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:57,420
SD<font color="#E5E5E5"> card to store the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doms to store locks</font>

214
00:09:53,639 --> 00:10:00,209
and everything a su power is controlled

215
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:02,250
by software so you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn the</font>

216
00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:06,479
AC on and off from the software

217
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:07,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">interface it has yards it has 40 PIOs if</font>

218
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,279
you want add some<font color="#E5E5E5"> blinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> LEDs or</font>

219
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:15,120
whatever and it has a standalone mode so

220
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:18,990
no computer required USB mode which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

221
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:22,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">CDC device and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network it's gone network</font>

222
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:25,769
mode and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can be powered either by a</font>

223
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:28,410
power supply by external battery or by

224
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:30,329
obd2 plugging<font color="#E5E5E5"> it straight</font>

225
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:32,790
it has the<font color="#CCCCCC"> blink it wall color LED which</font>

226
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:37,979
is funny and stuff and the whole board

227
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:39,300
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2500 $25 toys quad cheap so cannot</font>

228
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,050
talk a little bit about the firmware

229
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,959
features that are currently implemented

230
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:47,699
all the actions on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cam badger are</font>

231
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:50,219
handled by the firmware which means it's

232
00:10:47,699 --> 00:10:53,399
not yet another interface but it's a

233
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:57,360
standalone tool it supports your estp

234
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:59,879
2.0 and of course raw can not just

235
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,370
logging but also parsing will actually

236
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:04,379
show that I'm it supports a man in the

237
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:07,379
middle so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have like the two</font>

238
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:09,839
interfaces and connect to one verse it

239
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:12,029
didn't at one and like the output is it

240
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,660
the second one you can modify<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

241
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:17,610
packets on the fly and<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the rules</font>

242
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:19,469
are sort in the SD card you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

243
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:21,629
configure it on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> computer and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

244
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:25,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">take it into your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> car and you don't need</font>

245
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:28,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">a computer for that we're going to show</font>

246
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:31,550
you the security exercise<font color="#CCCCCC"> jack later</font>

247
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:35,880
that's some it's somewhat newish attack

248
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:40,589
that can emulate as IDs in peds from a

249
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:43,740
log so you can say like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will record me</font>

250
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:46,829
driving to the supermarket and then you

251
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:49,110
can replay this data well actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

252
00:11:46,829 --> 00:11:50,370
replay for example in the use case you

253
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:53,250
have a dongle that request information

254
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:55,259
from the car constantly then the

255
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:59,790
emulator will wait for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those requests</font>

256
00:11:55,259 --> 00:12:01,620
and remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> the point in time which</font>

257
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:04,620
data was returned while we're going to

258
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:06,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">get into more detail from that data</font>

259
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:09,149
transfers can be done to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SD card</font>

260
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,579
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> especially useful when you're</font>

261
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:14,399
the car that distributes firmware

262
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:18,269
updates to the to the modules over the

263
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:22,019
canvas and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course logging you dsgb</font>

264
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:25,589
rock<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it will also detect the can</font>

265
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:27,029
speed for you that's quite useful if you

266
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:28,769
don't have ever dealt with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> vehicle</font>

267
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:31,350
that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can speed saves a lot</font>

268
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:34,199
of them so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need to care about</font>

269
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:36,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and also as already mentioned it</font>

270
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:38,910
supports three modes of operation one is

271
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:41,469
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> standalone one with nothing attached</font>

272
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:43,360
just the LED is an output<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

273
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:46,870
for switching through the modes the

274
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,270
second one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the CDC mode and the third</font>

275
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:51,010
mode is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet mode which you can</font>

276
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:55,870
use for controlling multiple can matches

277
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:57,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">over evident all fancy yeah so yeah</font>

278
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:03,130
let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about protocol</font>

279
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:05,079
analysis so still visible so yeah many

280
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:07,510
SIDS already included in the film world

281
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,430
a different where is already out so you

282
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,900
guys can just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a straight</font>

283
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:13,630
after to talk if you have not<font color="#CCCCCC"> owned it</font>

284
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:15,730
already so it's extremely fast to add

285
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:17,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">support for us at this is just a switch</font>

286
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:21,070
case so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like out the bite and</font>

287
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:24,400
then are the actions it is extremely

288
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:29,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">highly burbles it gives you all the data</font>

289
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:30,670
for all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the parameters it like we were</font>

290
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,530
mentioning<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier everything somebody</font>

291
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:34,300
combat your film<font color="#CCCCCC"> work you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need to</font>

292
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:38,760
install anything just have a terminal

293
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:41,229
and the logs<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> story in the SD card</font>

294
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,780
just to make it more standalone and they

295
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:45,520
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be either</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Butte or retrieved from</font>

296
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:47,800
the combat without having to remove it

297
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:52,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">or what the GUI and it works with both</font>

298
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:55,030
EDS internal in protocol 2.0 and yeah

299
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:56,800
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Italian protocol 2.0 and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> UDS</font>

300
00:13:55,030 --> 00:14:00,640
interactive session no scripting is

301
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:03,219
required the way this works is you just

302
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:05,260
we will see it just start a session with

303
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,360
the ischium and then you get the options

304
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:09,430
decision with us<font color="#CCCCCC"> d alive so then you get</font>

305
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">to try stuff like okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's try to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> scum</font>

306
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:13,689
for this let's try for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this ID to get</font>

307
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:15,400
errors you succeed<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let now let's</font>

308
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:17,230
try adding<font color="#CCCCCC"> test address let's try</font>

309
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,850
removing it let's try changing<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this</font>

310
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:21,240
address everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> is done in real time</font>

311
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:25,000
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to try and try and try</font>

312
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:28,210
so you can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and forth easily and</font>

313
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,190
it has some built-in stands for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sadie</font>

314
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:34,810
parameters which are also like really

315
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:37,180
useful and the server the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cabbage server</font>

316
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:40,989
is made for making the temperature even

317
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:43,150
easier to use we were mainly inspired by

318
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:47,800
burp suit there that's why we choose the

319
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:50,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">topic attacking cars burps</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with cell so</font>

320
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:53,740
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> point is you can not only control</font>

321
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,019
multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cambridge's overhead in it so</font>

322
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,089
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

323
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:57,860
just leave them in the car somewhere in

324
00:14:56,089 --> 00:15:00,319
different bus networks then you go back

325
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:03,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your computer you can rename them to</font>

326
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:06,769
know where they are and use them in

327
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:09,290
parallel that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also very handy if you</font>

328
00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:12,230
won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to script so you can do like</font>

329
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:14,029
automated tests or a fuzzing we actually

330
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:18,799
tested the khemba jury with another

331
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:21,129
camera<font color="#E5E5E5"> chur yeah so really cool stuff</font>

332
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:24,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">the other net protocol is pretty simple</font>

333
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:27,709
it will just broadcast every two seconds

334
00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:29,720
I am here and then the temperature

335
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:31,518
server will connect what's in a connect

336
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,769
packet then it will pull for connivance

337
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,779
until it gets like stop current action

338
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:39,319
or action<font color="#E5E5E5"> finish command will be like</font>

339
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:40,670
lock can traffic or repeal a packet and

340
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:45,769
once that's done it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

341
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:48,410
pulling<font color="#CCCCCC"> for another action again so a</font>

342
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:49,959
good demonstration of the camera so<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

343
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:52,129
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the man</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> middle on the</font>

344
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:54,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">top picture you can see the original</font>

345
00:15:52,129 --> 00:15:56,629
traffic that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it wasn't easy you</font>

346
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:58,850
were sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> and on the bottom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

347
00:15:56,629 --> 00:16:01,699
see the change traffic so what you will

348
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:05,860
do is you will go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the GUI and set up</font>

349
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:09,769
some some rules like<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned replace</font>

350
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:12,799
you can set rules for specific IDs and

351
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:14,990
you can manipulate individual bytes or

352
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,459
you will define a mask which will say<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

353
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:18,319
I want to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first the second</font>

354
00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:20,959
and the last bite you don't have to swap

355
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:23,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">out the whole payload you can do some</font>

356
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:26,239
math operations on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the frames</font>

357
00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:27,618
pretty much everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do</font>

358
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,379
they're actually going to show that

359
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:33,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">right now yeah so the good thing about</font>

360
00:16:30,379 --> 00:16:34,730
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just as a quick example let's</font>

361
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:36,498
say that you have some black box or

362
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:38,029
something that's like checking on your

363
00:16:36,499 --> 00:16:40,939
speed and you really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go one</font>

364
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:42,730
speed up so what you would do in this

365
00:16:40,939 --> 00:16:44,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">case with the money in the middle</font>

366
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:46,339
everything would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like straight but</font>

367
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:49,850
then you would add a rule for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

368
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:51,379
specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> API d to change the bite that</font>

369
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:54,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">will represent the speed and divide them</font>

370
00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:57,529
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> two I don't know or just whatever so</font>

371
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:59,959
I don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually too</font>

372
00:16:57,529 --> 00:17:01,439
visible like the timing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like 20</font>

373
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:03,270
milliseconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> everywhere on</font>

374
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,150
rina and on the other end he says<font color="#CCCCCC"> he'll</font>

375
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:07,829
20 milliseconds or if the devices to

376
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,810
receive in the modified traffic just

377
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:12,329
cannot tell the difference is really

378
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:15,659
truly will tenders no actual today and

379
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:19,310
the data gets modified so yeah in a

380
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:25,290
stock let's see it in action<font color="#CCCCCC"> right there</font>

381
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:39,750
you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the guy so it gets into I</font>

382
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:41,399
don't know all right move so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

383
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:43,500
everybody can see that yeah that's a

384
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,410
combat<font color="#E5E5E5"> your server lets the server you</font>

385
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,820
can see right here so once you turn on

386
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:51,510
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> camera turn connected to the network</font>

387
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:54,360
you will see all<font color="#CCCCCC"> available Cambridge's</font>

388
00:17:51,510 --> 00:18:01,020
on the Left that's like the sidebar so

389
00:17:54,360 --> 00:18:04,620
let's connect to the sky are also called

390
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:06,240
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for ECB that's Mike amateur yeah and</font>

391
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">now for every action you do on the right</font>

392
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,130
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to select the camera</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear</font>

393
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:14,130
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's look some simple traffic first</font>

394
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:16,590
to demonstrate the logger there we go

395
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:18,630
it's also pretty fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can sort it</font>

396
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:21,480
like by frame<font color="#CCCCCC"> count for example so the</font>

397
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:24,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">news say always on top you can filter by</font>

398
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,970
IDs so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm actually going to be</font>

399
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:32,250
interested for those but also for this

400
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:34,740
one for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example you can also show only</font>

401
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:38,490
IDs that<font color="#E5E5E5"> popped up after certain amount</font>

402
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:39,960
of time for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example I want to leave my</font>

403
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:41,520
temperature running and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I'm going</font>

404
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:45,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">to perform an action on the cars such as</font>

405
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:47,100
unlocking the door but then there's a

406
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,110
lot of broadcast traffic I'm just not

407
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:52,889
interested in so i could say i want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

408
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:55,020
see only frames from new IDs that<font color="#E5E5E5"> popped</font>

409
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:58,320
up after<font color="#CCCCCC"> certain amount of time so let's</font>

410
00:18:55,020 --> 00:19:00,510
say after i don't know three packets for

411
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:05,370
it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be less when I increase it</font>

412
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:09,960
here you see so 10<font color="#E5E5E5"> C is like the</font>

413
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:12,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">fifteenth new ID and you can also</font>

414
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,740
exchange data between the taps here on

415
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,570
the top these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the actions you</font>

416
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,549
can perform

417
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:19,309
so i can say i want to replay the spigot

418
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:21,259
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to create a rule for this</font>

419
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:26,000
specific idea of this frame or for the

420
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:28,090
payload of the frame so right now let's

421
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,539
see how the man in the middle works

422
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:37,970
first you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm gonna resize it a</font>

423
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:42,129
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let's add a rule I want</font>

424
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:49,929
to swap the payload of any frame

425
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:52,190
containing the ID 80 the condition value

426
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:54,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">was used for the second kind of</font>

427
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:56,299
condition which in this case is specific

428
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:58,070
by its match so specific bites of the

429
00:19:56,299 --> 00:20:00,139
payload have to match and which bites

430
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:02,059
you will tell it by using the mask I'm

431
00:20:00,139 --> 00:20:04,580
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sell it all 0 now because I</font>

432
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:08,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have any frame from this</font>

433
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:14,090
specific ID to be changed i'm going to

434
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:17,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">use like one two three four</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five oh what</font>

435
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:23,240
a ditz the mask here wrong field two

436
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:25,250
three four<font color="#CCCCCC"> five oh yeah i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

437
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:28,309
show the actions first like you can do a

438
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:32,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of stuff here which is for the sake</font>

439
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:34,158
of showing you let's do this year should

440
00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:40,940
be all set now we push the rules to the

441
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:45,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">SD card success recent rules you see</font>

442
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:47,210
like from the eddie from idat the

443
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:50,059
payload was actually something like this

444
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:54,850
so nothing remotely similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the value</font>

445
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:58,610
ipod if we start the main in the middle

446
00:20:54,850 --> 00:21:00,980
the LED will go orange and i have

447
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:02,240
attached a debugging tool on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the second</font>

448
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:06,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">cam court which will contain the</font>

449
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:11,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">modified packets here we go I better</font>

450
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:15,129
hide this one and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see which one</font>

451
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:17,450
ad is one two three<font color="#E5E5E5"> four five six</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seven</font>

452
00:21:15,129 --> 00:21:19,490
so it's actually modifying it in real

453
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:22,110
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess you can notice the latency</font>

454
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:33,670
is pretty much the same on those

455
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:35,770
yeah okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> so should we keep on going are</font>

456
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:39,370
we yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to show the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> security</font>

457
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:41,350
exercises and stuff rich yeah but

458
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:43,209
afterwards<font color="#E5E5E5"> say oh the setup will be</font>

459
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:44,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">available in our booth so if you guys</font>

460
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:46,510
want to see it again or wanna play with

461
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:48,520
it a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit just come to a pool yeah</font>

462
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:50,490
we will be happy to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into details of</font>

463
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:54,639
all the features with you at the booth

464
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:59,920
so yeah now the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next thing security</font>

465
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:01,750
access hi jack why so om tools and some

466
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:04,270
third-party tools actually need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

467
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:06,190
authenticate themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ECU's to gain</font>

468
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:08,050
access to restricted features like for

469
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:11,410
example updating the firmware or

470
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:14,350
modifying some parameters blah blah so

471
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:16,270
these tools have fixed functions it's

472
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:19,179
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a big button like we'd write</font>

473
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:23,440
whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah but you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get to</font>

474
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:28,320
change too much stuff so yeah and why

475
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:33,100
would you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it because you can so yeah</font>

476
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:35,320
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> does it work so the thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

477
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:38,709
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> device which in this case is the</font>

478
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:40,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">cam badger that is acting as a bridge as</font>

479
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:43,540
a transfer range so it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> forwarding</font>

480
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:46,750
all the traffic but it is waiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

481
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:48,490
security access request to happen so

482
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:50,550
it's actually inspecting all the traffic

483
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:54,910
but it is forwarding all the traffic

484
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:57,490
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found ourselves within our</font>

485
00:22:54,910 --> 00:23:00,430
pen testing vehicles that sometimes you

486
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:02,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">get a security access hi jack but then</font>

487
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:05,800
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not in the right diagnostics mode</font>

488
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:07,990
so when you attempt to use the security

489
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,879
across sample to turn the memory they

490
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:11,980
see you will reject because it will tell

491
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:16,360
you like no I'm in the wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> Diagnostics</font>

492
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:18,880
mode so<font color="#E5E5E5"> before keep on going with a</font>

493
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:21,070
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> hijack they come badger with</font>

494
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,140
actually switched to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Diagnostics</font>

495
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:25,270
session type you have told it to and

496
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:29,890
then it was tough word in the security

497
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:31,490
that access and if the security access

498
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:33,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">exceeds</font>

499
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:35,630
then the cambogia will cut out the

500
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:38,420
external tool and will take control<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

501
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:41,059
the session which I leaves you in the

502
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:43,490
desire diagnostics session mode with

503
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:47,139
security access without having to care

504
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:56,300
about a kiss or algorithms or anything

505
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:59,780
so yeah demo again let's see so now you

506
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:01,879
will also get to see the CDC mode the

507
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:04,520
CDC mode starts automatically when in a

508
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:07,460
huge p cable actually when a computer is

509
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:09,050
connected to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> USB port</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so you don't</font>

510
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,700
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to set it up at pull automatically</font>

511
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:12,320
I mean we're actually using here

512
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,780
tournament which is just as real so does

513
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,399
it combat<font color="#E5E5E5"> your interface for USB before</font>

514
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:18,080
we saw the other net which was the GUI

515
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,870
this is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like plug-and-play Dwarfs</font>

516
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,520
on all always<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously so just for the</font>

517
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:25,129
sake of showing you like how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font>

518
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:31,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">normally so you start a diagnostic</font>

519
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:36,010
session oh yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I remove the USB for the</font>

520
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:45,200
other net will just be here like it back

521
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:49,040
and we said yes we got it so let's go

522
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:52,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">there so let's start are actually at</font>

523
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:56,990
agnostic session so the a drone ID would

524
00:24:52,700 --> 00:25:02,090
be 70 in this case for the test is you

525
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:05,660
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> I type anything yet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and 7 e 8 430</font>

526
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:09,830
see you and thats a session types<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

527
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:14,090
one so now we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a session actually</font>

528
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:17,178
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can like for the sake of testing</font>

529
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:19,250
let's read data by ID okay so let's read

530
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:22,850
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bin of the ACU this is the one we</font>

531
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:25,550
have here on the desk so yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

532
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:27,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">beam but I get oops access</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font>

533
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:30,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">attend to rejected because message</font>

534
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:32,750
length or<font color="#E5E5E5"> formatting correct</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yep i'm not</font>

535
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:34,670
using the tester address so yeah let's

536
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:36,920
change the mode while<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm still</font>

537
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:40,280
connected to using tester address

538
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:43,580
so let's enable it let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

539
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:46,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">Thunder one and it's a def one which is</font>

540
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:48,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">the typical address ok now we're using</font>

541
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:52,010
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tester address let's try again to it</font>

542
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:53,660
being from it so yeah this time goes up

543
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:57,290
see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pin because we are</font>

544
00:25:53,660 --> 00:26:03,050
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tester address so yeah let's</font>

545
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:05,300
try for sample I don't know let's remove

546
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:07,310
that Esther dress quickly because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

547
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:09,919
can also disable eating will time for

548
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:11,780
your test let's try security access so

549
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,550
we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> use a known algorithm we just</font>

550
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:16,639
implemented like for testing like one or

551
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:20,090
two security algorithms we reverse it so

552
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:26,060
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use level</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three and the</font>

553
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:28,399
keys to FC nine so Bob access<font color="#CCCCCC"> reacted</font>

554
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:30,889
because Serb is not supported in active

555
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,720
session so that's what we were talking

556
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:36,200
about earlier sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

557
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:40,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">in direct a diagnostics mode so yeah</font>

558
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:43,100
what should we<font color="#CCCCCC"> do so let's go to the</font>

559
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:45,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">agnostic session control and let's scan</font>

560
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:47,330
for available session types so the

561
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:49,630
authentication is not like binary you

562
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:52,790
have different<font color="#CCCCCC"> levels of privilege yeah</font>

563
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:55,700
so yeah so we scan those are the

564
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:58,399
available modes so let's then switch I

565
00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:01,250
like for f4f looks like fun so let's

566
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:05,090
switch to a custom session and let's

567
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:07,940
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for F and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so now we have that</font>

568
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:14,149
let's try security access again so the

569
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:16,160
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing again and to FC nine so yeah</font>

570
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:18,470
now security access granted so now

571
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:21,710
wearing they see you so now if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

572
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:24,290
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> read memory for example let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> read</font>

573
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:28,520
memory by address let's start for and th

574
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:30,379
0 0 0 let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> written bites under you go</font>

575
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">this adam from the memory</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from this you</font>

576
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,680
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's like the normal way I mean you</font>

577
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:37,280
know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> algorithm you know the stuff</font>

578
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:39,440
right so let's turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> a decision let's</font>

579
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:41,420
suppose I actually do not know the key i

580
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:45,500
do not know the security access so

581
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:46,290
obviously if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i well I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

582
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,030
tell you let's not

583
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:49,889
make this<font color="#E5E5E5"> to them if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> read the</font>

584
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:52,080
memory without security access they see

585
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:55,230
will tell me yeah just go away that

586
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,939
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really my memory so what are</font>

587
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:58,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">we going to do we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to hijack a</font>

588
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,350
security session so that's going to

589
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:05,940
protocol menu lets go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

590
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:13,379
access let's say hi jack UDS let's say

591
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:15,480
seven e0 let's say seven e8 let's say

592
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:17,160
any security access level which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero</font>

593
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:20,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">zero you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also say that specific</font>

594
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:22,470
level if you want and yeah I wanna be in

595
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:25,500
diagnostic mode for F because remember

596
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:28,440
it didn't work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> module 1 so I want to</font>

597
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:32,160
be in for it so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say yeah switch to</font>

598
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:35,450
fourth so now it's a waiting for any

599
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:38,220
traffic to happen to map<font color="#E5E5E5"> where on which</font>

600
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:42,450
connector is<font color="#E5E5E5"> hid so let's give its own</font>

601
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:45,060
traffic we<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen to have a tool which I</font>

602
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:47,130
like a lot it's called<font color="#CCCCCC"> MPPs is a Chinese</font>

603
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:48,990
clone the original one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really awesome</font>

604
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:51,530
but for testing we just need like a

605
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:57,360
cheap one so we got the clone but for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

606
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:59,970
so yeah let's see redc ready so you see

607
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:03,000
I read this you Ed so I get data but

608
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:04,950
yeah what did<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come at you do the</font>

609
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">combat you're already mapped the ids and</font>

610
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:09,510
now it's waiting for<font color="#E5E5E5"> security access</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

611
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:16,620
so yeah let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep it some security</font>

612
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:19,860
access let's read the flash but i never

613
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:22,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">have secured and we got the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

614
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:24,600
access so just to show that it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

615
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:33,990
a security access let's try reading the

616
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:37,199
memory and yeah did I<font color="#E5E5E5"> presented us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh so</font>

617
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:38,820
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Satan box so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you see we're</font>

618
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,000
able to retain memory so we actually

619
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:44,580
hijacked a session on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> diagnostics</font>

620
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,190
mode we wanted to and now we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

621
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:48,629
read<font color="#CCCCCC"> the memory without knowing and</font>

622
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:50,100
again just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show that it is not</font>

623
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:54,020
possible without the security access

624
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:56,610
let's go in there really quick<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero</font>

625
00:29:54,020 --> 00:30:01,950
siete Ocho

626
00:29:56,610 --> 00:30:08,729
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> 01 actually asked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all 44 f if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I try</font>

627
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:11,190
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> read memory it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to say no</font>

628
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:13,320
because Jax is required so yeah we

629
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:18,240
probably see a hijack the session so

630
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:21,809
that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> it works and it's good so</font>

631
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,850
remember any device that can<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve any</font>

632
00:30:21,809 --> 00:30:25,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">texture that can solve the challenge for</font>

633
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:27,480
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the door opener if</font>

634
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:30,178
you hijack the session and you can do

635
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,919
anything you want there yeah and then

636
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:35,010
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have full control to scan memory</font>

637
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,750
ranges<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try some other staff even to</font>

638
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:38,730
write I mean to change some parameters

639
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:43,830
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anything without caring</font>

640
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:46,080
about the security itself so yeah I sort

641
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:48,480
of mentioned that already because<font color="#E5E5E5"> UDS</font>

642
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">ntp are so handy right they split up</font>

643
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,040
your packets and you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to care</font>

644
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:55,649
about the payload some<font color="#E5E5E5"> manufacturers</font>

645
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:58,860
like to distribute firmware updates over

646
00:30:55,650 --> 00:31:00,660
the canvas so two different modules you

647
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:02,370
know it will get like an initial one or

648
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:04,260
either from the factory I don't know

649
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:06,750
HTTPS or whatever and then it will

650
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:10,020
distribute each firmware update to the

651
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:13,530
modules and the temperature<font color="#E5E5E5"> can grab</font>

652
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:15,480
these these ones on the fly and lock

653
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:17,580
them to the SD it will automatically

654
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,230
look for those transfers and you can

655
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:21,149
tell it to dump the binary else on the

656
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:24,150
SD card<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is very interesting</font>

657
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:27,179
because on the on the way to the car it

658
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:28,890
might actually be decrypted so if you're

659
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:31,140
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that you want you we'll</font>

660
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:35,720
just see some ciphertext but on the

661
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:35,720
canvas itself mostly it's not encrypted

662
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:44,189
so yeah we<font color="#CCCCCC"> survive sort of the demos so</font>

663
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:47,669
yeah what else<font color="#E5E5E5"> can they come but you do</font>

664
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:50,280
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> he was just mention it can dump TP</font>

665
00:31:47,669 --> 00:31:52,970
and UDS transfers which are<font color="#CCCCCC"> useful favor</font>

666
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:55,168
updates it kind of poof up with the data

667
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:56,549
through money in the middle I meerut so

668
00:31:55,169 --> 00:31:59,220
we just saw it we didn't talk that much

669
00:31:56,549 --> 00:32:02,129
about a minute or<font color="#CCCCCC"> two we will do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

670
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:04,710
yeah the GPIO scan also be used<font color="#CCCCCC"> for both</font>

671
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:07,360
loading like in tricor

672
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:12,640
microcontrollers and you can manipulate

673
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:14,649
other signals via your pins so we wanted

674
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,750
to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it very easy to take the chem</font>

675
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:19,210
major not only to build it like with

676
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:21,730
cheap components it's also very easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

677
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:23,440
solder but on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> software part we also</font>

678
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:25,780
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make it easy to add like your</font>

679
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,870
own stuff for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said these for</font>

680
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:32,440
housing or other functions for automatic

681
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:33,760
tasting whatever so just some

682
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,070
instructions if you want to get your

683
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:38,200
hands on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will have to get the</font>

684
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:40,899
lpcxpresso ide if you really want to

685
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:43,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">work with it but you can also use the</font>

686
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:45,990
m-bit online ID which comes with a nice

687
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:48,250
compiler which actually optimizes a lot

688
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:52,600
the camp at your server is written in

689
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:55,120
Python in QT you just need two or three

690
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:59,620
dependencies mainly Python 2.7 and two

691
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:02,500
packets from paper it's all GPL we

692
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:06,129
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> publish it you can look it up on</font>

693
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:08,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">kids up yeah that's pretty much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font>

694
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:10,540
yeah just to get back to the emulator we

695
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:13,210
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk that much about it actually</font>

696
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:15,159
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> miss some straight so what Emily told</font>

697
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:18,310
us that's not a function that we

698
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:19,690
recently implemented in it and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

699
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:21,399
either<font color="#E5E5E5"> come back you to your vehicle</font>

700
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:24,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so we talked about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a standalone</font>

701
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:26,740
mode which doesn't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything and to</font>

702
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:28,840
use the standalone mode they come back

703
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:31,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">your has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a small push button on the</font>

704
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,620
bottom so depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> times</font>

705
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,810
