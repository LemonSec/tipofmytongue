00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:23,259
assurance work currently looking a lot

6
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:28,390
of smart meters and stuff but basically

7
00:00:23,259 --> 00:00:31,179
we do embedded systems<font color="#CCCCCC"> them i'm also a</font>

8
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:34,690
long time def con goon I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been doing</font>

couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of speakers normally every month</font>

18
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:01,810
and about 100 people turn up so it's a

19
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:04,628
good opportunity for networking if

20
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:10,899
you're in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> London hacka scene or</font>

21
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:16,240
security seen Christmas<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mike Osmond and</font>

22
00:01:10,899 --> 00:01:18,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">Dominic spell gave me a hack RF which is</font>

23
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,499
a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool device if any of you into</font>

24
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:26,740
software defined radio you probably know

25
00:01:20,499 --> 00:01:29,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">about it and so I decided</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to put</font>

26
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:32,979
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> together using it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font>

27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:38,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">my appreciation and it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just an</font>

28
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:42,990
amazingly cool toy basically so what

29
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:46,259
this talk is about is attacking your TB

30
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:49,630
so you're sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> at home watching TV</font>

31
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:55,560
and you're receiving your signal either

32
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:58,090
via terrestrial antenna or via satellite

33
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,600
watching some family-friendly cartoon

34
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:03,759
obviously if your TV is also connected

35
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,419
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet so this attack is is</font>

36
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,908
actually aimed not just at<font color="#E5E5E5"> smart TVs but</font>

37
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:12,610
a lot of TVs even before proper<font color="#CCCCCC"> Smart</font>

38
00:02:09,908 --> 00:02:15,790
TVs came along had an internet

39
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:19,329
connection mainly so they could

40
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:24,640
do firmware updates and stuff so this

41
00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:26,430
attack actually targets yeah not just

42
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,439
smart TVs but every TV in the UK

43
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:32,680
listening so what we're going to do is

44
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:35,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">introduce the bad guy he's going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

45
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:41,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">transmit to your TV so sitting outside</font>

46
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:44,138
again through your antenna so you know

47
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:46,298
you have either as I say your roof

48
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:49,599
antenna or your satellite dish so that's

49
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:51,970
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack medium and then he's going to</font>

50
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,798
create a connection back to himself over

51
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:56,409
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet if your TV is internet</font>

52
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:58,120
connected if it's not internet-connected

53
00:02:56,409 --> 00:03:01,120
I have a different attack but you'll see

54
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:04,359
that in the demos so yeah I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

55
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:09,669
be doing live demos so demo<font color="#CCCCCC"> God's please</font>

56
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:13,510
smile on me<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so why why am I doing</font>

57
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:17,769
this I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a lot of a series</font>

58
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:20,798
of TV hacks started in hotels playing

59
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:24,220
with the infrared system so i was

60
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:27,540
curious if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> brute forced the command</font>

61
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:29,769
space of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> infrared in your hotel room</font>

62
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:33,959
what could you<font color="#E5E5E5"> find that you know what</font>

63
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:35,680
other features were enabled on the TV

64
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,349
obviously the first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was looking</font>

65
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:42,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was free pay-per-view or free porn</font>

66
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:45,790
basically other in room services minibar

67
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:49,030
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite surprised how much stuff was</font>

68
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:51,548
connected through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the TV so your minibar</font>

69
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:54,220
when you took something out registered

70
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:57,729
and through a system that was using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

71
00:03:54,220 --> 00:04:01,209
same back end as the TV you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> check</font>

72
00:03:57,729 --> 00:04:02,530
out sometimes on your TV so I had a lot

73
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:04,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">of fun with that you know like</font>

74
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,639
registering my TV in a different room

75
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,228
checking people out and setting a

76
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">wake-up call so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have plenty of time</font>

77
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:13,810
to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the problem in the morning</font>

78
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:17,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">so and actually you could get all the</font>

79
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:19,810
billing and stuff and scarily in some

80
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:22,449
hotels<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ended up actually managing a</font>

81
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:26,469
bunch of the backend servers so they

82
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:28,960
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a microsoft you know I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is or</font>

83
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:29,650
something server which they used for all

84
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,330
kinds of stuff

85
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:35,169
like the info screens when you walk into

86
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:38,530
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hotel and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I could upload my own</font>

87
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:43,180
images onto those screens so goatse gets

88
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:46,599
a day out and ended some stuff with

89
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:50,110
satellite again free pay-per-view

90
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,850
obviously and that was interesting we

91
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,979
were finding feeds so basically if

92
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,990
there's a live event like Formula One or

93
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:58,210
a boxing match in Vegas or something

94
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:01,180
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this this would normally be</font>

95
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:04,150
transmitted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the headquarters of the</font>

96
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:06,220
TV company via a different satellite and

97
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:09,310
then mixed and edited and then

98
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:11,590
rebroadcast on pay-per-view<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you</font>

99
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:15,130
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> find the original live stream you</font>

100
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:17,590
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just tap into that this was a long</font>

101
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:20,940
time ago actually we at the time

102
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:23,739
Princess Diana had just died<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Paris</font>

103
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:26,349
and we found some live feeds from

104
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:28,300
journalists out there who were literally

105
00:05:26,349 --> 00:05:30,969
sat in the hotel room with a camera and

106
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:33,280
a Mike because they had to be ready if a

107
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,240
story broke they had to be ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you</font>

108
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,099
know they couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be messing around</font>

109
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,060
setting up feed so that feed was just

110
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:42,820
running<font color="#CCCCCC"> 24 7 and they did every now and</font>

111
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,860
then that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know get up do up let I do</font>

112
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,240
that piece to camera and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then being</font>

113
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,830
journalists who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are used to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being around</font>

114
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,380
cameras and<font color="#E5E5E5"> mics they just forget about</font>

115
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:53,650
it so there we were just watching<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

116
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:57,190
was going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this hotel room for kind</font>

117
00:05:53,650 --> 00:06:00,760
of interesting found a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data feeds</font>

118
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:02,590
as well so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some plugins you</font>

119
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,930
can put in so you take your satellite

120
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:07,840
feed create a virtual Ethernet port and

121
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:09,760
then dump it through Wireshark and again

122
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:15,448
that was pretty fascinating what was out

123
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:19,030
there I then did some talks receiving

124
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:20,710
dvb so we switched off analog in the UK

125
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:23,469
a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago all the channels are now</font>

126
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:27,570
digital so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was curious what else is</font>

127
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:29,860
there free pay-per-view obviously and

128
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:32,680
that got me really interested there a

129
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:37,300
couple of channels that are doing adult

130
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:40,950
content shall we say<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they were</font>

131
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:43,480
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to monetize that so how do you</font>

132
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:46,240
had you restrict access

133
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:48,760
to a broadcast medium where there's no

134
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:53,350
back channel and what they were doing

135
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:55,240
was using a premium rate phone number to

136
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:58,570
provide an unlock code which would then

137
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:00,160
retune your TV to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right channel and</font>

138
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:03,670
I was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> curious how that worked so</font>

139
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">I wanted to to break that system so</font>

140
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:07,150
that's when I started looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> into it</font>

141
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:09,220
and it turned out there using this

142
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:14,859
standard called MPEG and<font color="#CCCCCC"> n egg is what</font>

143
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:20,200
we're going to talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> today so this</font>

144
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:23,470
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Meg I'll just let you read that</font>

145
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:29,289
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of boring basically</font>

146
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:32,620
it's like teletext on steroids<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so you</font>

147
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:34,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">can do way more with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it teletext is just</font>

148
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:37,720
block letters and block graphics with

149
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:42,400
MPEG it's more like a proper structured

150
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:48,340
language you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can embed video audio you</font>

151
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:50,169
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do graphics all kinds of stuff so in</font>

152
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:53,710
the UK if you want to be free view

153
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:57,430
compliant so preview is the standard for

154
00:07:53,710 --> 00:08:01,090
UK digital television then you have to

155
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:03,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">be compliant to this book which defines</font>

156
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:08,380
that the standard for<font color="#E5E5E5"> em egg and what</font>

157
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:10,690
the TV's have to do you can you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can only</font>

158
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:13,320
read<font color="#CCCCCC"> the book if you join the group but</font>

159
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:15,490
like all these things that's based on

160
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:19,409
standards so if you go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

161
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:21,700
ratification process websites you can

162
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:23,080
you can get the final versions of

163
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:26,050
everything that ended<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> being the</font>

164
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:32,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">members only book so it is publicly out</font>

165
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:36,940
there if you dig enough and this is

166
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:39,339
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hierarchy what it does so</font>

167
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:41,800
you've got various data feeds and the

168
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:44,350
thing that interested me here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

169
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:49,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason that this talk is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> called the</font>

170
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:51,160
black button pivot is the system in the

171
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:54,100
UK is known as red button so it's free

172
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,480
view but the that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> M head content is</font>

173
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,520
known as red button because when you

174
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,370
press the red button on any BBC channel

175
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:03,760
up comes some stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can then</font>

176
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:07,330
start playing with and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice that in</font>

177
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:10,900
the standard they have a hypertext entry

178
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:14,380
point so this means that you can be

179
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:16,329
delivering<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet content and that's</font>

180
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:19,000
when it became interesting so the pivot

181
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:21,520
is pivoting from your analog signal

182
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:28,450
hitting your antenna to an<font color="#CCCCCC"> actual</font>

183
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:32,910
connection over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet so this was</font>

184
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:35,950
a the talk I gave about receiving data

185
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:38,920
it was called porn free because it was

186
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:40,570
about getting free porn obviously being

187
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,849
hackers we have no boundaries so we

188
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:46,390
don't care how to do the subject<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

189
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:50,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll dive in any way if you want to</font>

190
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:53,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">watch it you can see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it on that youtube</font>

191
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:55,390
link<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to cut to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the chase so</font>

192
00:09:53,830 --> 00:10:00,310
I'll skip most of it but I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font>

193
00:09:55,390 --> 00:10:02,770
you the technical attack and how they

194
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:06,189
were using<font color="#E5E5E5"> em Hague to protect the</font>

195
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:08,829
content and warning there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

196
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:11,350
bit of nudity in this nothing more than

197
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:13,990
you would see on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> south of France</font>

198
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:17,590
beach but if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily offended look</font>

199
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:20,320
away towards the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the clip so</font>

200
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:22,450
what's going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is it all</font>

201
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,770
happens reasonably fast so i'll explain

202
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:27,400
in advance what's going to happen so

203
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:30,340
basically what i've done is downloaded

204
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:33,270
the MPEG and i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> running a software</font>

205
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:37,120
version of what's going on inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> the TV</font>

206
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:40,660
so in one window it's displaying what

207
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,190
you would see on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the TV screen and what</font>

208
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:44,199
you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> see is it comes up with like a</font>

209
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:47,590
holding screen and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> challenge and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

210
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:50,190
says here's a magic number dial this

211
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:52,600
premium rate number typing that

212
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:55,480
challenge and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll get back an unlock</font>

213
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,950
pin<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and this was the bit I was</font>

214
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:02,350
curious about how does that actually

215
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:05,440
work so my software decoder that's

216
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:07,270
playing the output stream I literally

217
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,010
added one line of debugging so what

218
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:10,569
you're seeing in the other screen is

219
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:11,630
whenever there was an arithmetic

220
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:14,480
operation

221
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:20,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">i spit out what that operation is and</font>

222
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:24,140
what the numbers involved were ok so the

223
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:26,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">bottom window is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the debugger this is</font>

224
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:33,050
the splash screen that comes up so it's

225
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:37,730
saying send<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6422</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 41 or 42 one to this</font>

226
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:40,609
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> or dial so down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here it's</font>

227
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:43,130
compared i just typed in 123456 and it

228
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:45,140
actually popped up the number it was

229
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:48,230
comparing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to so it told me the answer</font>

230
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:51,800
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> so and that's all you need to</font>

231
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:55,670
see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that ok so so yeah it just</font>

232
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:57,520
unlocked and I debug the code further

233
00:11:55,670 --> 00:12:00,050
and figured out what their algorithm was

234
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:05,750
and it was literally kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

235
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:09,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">twelve-step crappy math thing so what</font>

236
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:13,810
was actually going on so basically quick

237
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:17,330
primer on our digital TV works you have

238
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:21,920
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> streams called elemental</font>

239
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:24,770
elemental streams<font color="#CCCCCC"> all Pease's and within</font>

240
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,170
those that they get gathered together

241
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:31,970
into a pit so the pit is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> program ID</font>

242
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:35,120
so program you know 15<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 34 is the</font>

243
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:38,390
adult<font color="#E5E5E5"> channel and in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's a list</font>

244
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:42,230
of in the program<font color="#CCCCCC"> Association table</font>

245
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:44,480
there's a list of elemental streams that

246
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:47,300
are there so what's happening is these

247
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:51,590
guys are broadcasting a dummy audio and

248
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:53,660
video stream with nothing in it and then

249
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:55,460
alongside that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've got two more</font>

250
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:59,510
audio and video streams that are not

251
00:12:55,460 --> 00:13:02,300
mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the association table but</font>

252
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:04,670
there's also some em egg so the MPEG

253
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:06,319
loads it doesn't it does its thing it

254
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:10,250
gets you to dial the premium premium

255
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:13,250
rate number and then once you've

256
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:17,360
validated it then says<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok now I'm going</font>

257
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:19,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">to tell the TV to view these elementals</font>

258
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,070
dreams instead of the ones that it

259
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:24,529
actually tuned to so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a smart</font>

260
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:26,449
enough TV you could just<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

261
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:28,069
tune to these streams instead of those

262
00:13:26,449 --> 00:13:32,389
and you would have free access to the

263
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:33,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">the porn obviously so that's what's</font>

264
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:38,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">going on under the hood does that make</font>

265
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:40,550
sense so<font color="#CCCCCC"> far yeah okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cool so we</font>

266
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:42,230
figured it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was like okay well</font>

267
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,969
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy and there's better porn on</font>

268
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:49,189
the internet anyway so never need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

269
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:53,480
look at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> again so how exactly do you</font>

270
00:13:49,189 --> 00:13:57,529
do this so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use a standard dvb-t dongle</font>

271
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:59,870
so just cheapo USB dongle<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a bit</font>

272
00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:01,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">of software called RB or red button</font>

273
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:05,240
which you can download from<font color="#E5E5E5"> sourceforge</font>

274
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:08,990
and this is a complete implementation of

275
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:12,949
all the red button code effectively all

276
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:15,410
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> M egg support infrastructure so RB</font>

277
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:18,319
download will just capture the data for

278
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:20,089
you it will find the the MPEG kids in

279
00:14:18,319 --> 00:14:22,550
the stream and it will pull them out and

280
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:26,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">it will create all the individual files</font>

281
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:30,800
that make up this application it also

282
00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:33,579
has authoring tools in it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

283
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,349
compile MPEG code and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> test it</font>

284
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:38,779
and it has the player so the player i

285
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:41,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">was using in that clip was from this</font>

286
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:42,920
same suite so everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to</font>

287
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:47,180
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand what's going on under</font>

288
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:51,259
the hood so<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's in there basically</font>

289
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:53,809
you've got three things images search or

290
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:58,009
other data files and the binary

291
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:59,899
executable which is it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually an</font>

292
00:14:58,009 --> 00:15:03,139
interpreted language<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's stored in</font>

293
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:06,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">asn.1 that's so effectively you've got</font>

294
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:08,209
source code so the images sorry when you

295
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:11,540
download this is the kind of data

296
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:16,609
structure you get for each service you

297
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:20,149
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a directory so 15 232 is the the</font>

298
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:21,620
adult channel as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said that links</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

299
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:25,160
bunch of files in what they call a

300
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:29,509
carousel if you look in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the carousels</font>

301
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:31,990
directory then<font color="#E5E5E5"> again it's just you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

302
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:34,879
file number<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 2 3 4 5 but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's then</font>

303
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:38,000
translated to the name that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was used in</font>

304
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:42,050
the code<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so it's all very sensible</font>

305
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,130
ruptures very easy to understand and<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

306
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:47,839
course you get some really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

307
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:54,200
stuff like certificates and TLS keys and

308
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:56,330
so on which obviously it's fun so the

309
00:15:54,200 --> 00:16:00,760
integers are just images so they can use

310
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:05,390
them in the displays certificates are

311
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:09,350
obviously certificates this looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

312
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:11,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">x509 but I can't get my x509 decoder to</font>

313
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:13,760
decode it so I'm still playing with that

314
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,660
but it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be some standard that</font>

315
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:22,760
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned on with the Royal code</font>

316
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:24,790
again binary but if you decode it it

317
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:29,120
looks like that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nicely laid out</font>

318
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:34,760
easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand and as you see in</font>

319
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:36,260
this one we've got a an HTTP link so

320
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,590
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually going to load some</font>

321
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:41,840
content from outside and TS is a

322
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:43,550
transport stream so if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to</font>

323
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:47,660
that the slide where I was showing you

324
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:50,150
how a TV program is put together same

325
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:52,370
thing so that's the same data stream so

326
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:55,370
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can embed in a transport</font>

327
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:57,440
stream can be received by the MPEG

328
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:59,150
decoder and just pass to the tuna and

329
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:07,959
played as if it had come in over the

330
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:07,959
antenna so what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the vulnerabilities</font>

331
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:13,939
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I can force the TV to connect</font>

332
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,670
back to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet I can reveal your</font>

333
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:18,670
IP address so I now<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vector for</font>

334
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:20,949
attacking you you're sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> at home</font>

335
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:23,810
anonymous to me I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> no way of knowing</font>

336
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:27,199
what your IP addresses of that of that

337
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:31,720
home but if I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to connect back to</font>

338
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,720
me then I know what your IP address is

339
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,810
maybe I can send you I mean obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

340
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:38,180
can send you malicious content I can

341
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:41,179
change the images<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the data streams</font>

342
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:43,940
that you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at they don't have</font>

343
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:45,830
to be signed so within the m head code

344
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:51,220
itself it decides whether to trust that

345
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:51,220
data or not but even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it does</font>

346
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:57,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">I can send you the appropriate</font>

347
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:58,639
certificate so you will trust it so I

348
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:02,000
haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> played around with buffer</font>

349
00:17:58,639 --> 00:18:04,039
overflows and so on for me this is more

350
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,169
kind of proof of concept it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

351
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:09,429
okay I've proved that I can create<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

352
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:12,289
channel what the actual attacks are well

353
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:15,440
that's up to guys who understand that

354
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:21,860
stuff more than me I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a network</font>

355
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:25,639
attack going and this is the main point

356
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:28,039
so the trust model is you know there's a

357
00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:29,990
bunch of things to do a certification if

358
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:32,480
it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> in from the internet but if it</font>

359
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:35,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">comes in through the antenna always</font>

360
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,879
trusted<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay there is no you know that</font>

361
00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:40,519
the standard says you must trust what

362
00:18:37,879 --> 00:18:42,379
comes in through the antenna and why not

363
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:45,259
because obviously the Queen wouldn't

364
00:18:42,379 --> 00:18:56,000
send you bad stuff right we trust the

365
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:57,379
BBC yeah standard says that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> fine so as</font>

366
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,870
i mentioned i'm going to do a bunch of

367
00:18:57,379 --> 00:19:05,509
live demos so just in case they go<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll</font>

368
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:08,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">be wrong this is what's supposed to</font>

369
00:19:05,509 --> 00:19:10,039
happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my kind of journey</font>

370
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,639
through figuring out can I be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

371
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:15,889
broadcast company so I started by just

372
00:19:13,639 --> 00:19:19,610
broadcasting my own webcam so can i

373
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:22,490
generate a stream of data send it can I

374
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:27,350
take an existing transport stream send

375
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:30,919
that can I capture a broadcast transport

376
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:33,949
stream and replay that can I do that

377
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:38,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">live so capture with one device stream</font>

378
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:40,730
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the other and then moving on to</font>

379
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:45,168
the data services can I do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

380
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:49,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing but with embedded M ake create my</font>

381
00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:53,000
own MPEG and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in the slides</font>

382
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:54,769
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> given to these guys so you</font>

383
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,200
can have them afterwards I guess they'll

384
00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:59,659
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the website I've put the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> detailed</font>

385
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,309
command so don't worry if I'm going too

386
00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:02,960
fast in the demos to see what I'm

387
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:04,759
actually doing everything I'm doing is

388
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,230
in the slide so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go home</font>

389
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:09,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font>

390
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:12,760
replicate this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't yet tested it</font>

391
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:15,490
against dvb-s which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> satellite and</font>

392
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,990
dvb-c which is cable but there's no

393
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:18,549
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> it shouldn't work it's all the</font>

394
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:21,070
same standard I just have to tweak the

395
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:27,850
frequency and possibly the modulation

396
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:30,580
slightly so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the tools hack RF</font>

397
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:33,219
one as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mentioned all the software is</font>

398
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:37,470
open source so I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> written one</font>

399
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:39,400
line of code for this I'm lazy so I just

400
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:42,340
gobble stuff together with other

401
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:47,620
people's code you know maybe put a

402
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:51,250
debugger in here or there the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dongle yes</font>

403
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:54,010
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cheapo looks you know it's no</font>

404
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:57,790
bigger than the USB memory stick really

405
00:20:54,010 --> 00:21:06,790
and that's all you need to to receive

406
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:10,200
the data we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually find we found</font>

407
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:14,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">the bug in canoe radio and fixed it so</font>

408
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:20,110
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that mentioned it yeah that should</font>

409
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:22,090
be in the main stream<font color="#CCCCCC"> by new so a couple</font>

410
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:26,139
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things so the way the way I'm doing</font>

411
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:28,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">my testing this is a set-top box so if</font>

412
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:31,090
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these in the UK if you've</font>

413
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:32,950
got an old analog TV or you know you've

414
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:36,040
just got a monitor<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you want to watch</font>

415
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:40,059
broadcast TV you would plug something

416
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:43,299
like this in standard TV antenna going

417
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:47,440
up to the roof all<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done is taken a</font>

418
00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:49,179
wall panel which you would normally you

419
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:55,570
know wire into your structured cabling

420
00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:57,429
and I've connected a an SMA cable to the

421
00:21:55,570 --> 00:22:01,570
back of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just converting my</font>

422
00:21:57,429 --> 00:22:04,660
TV antenna to the hack RF to be legal

423
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:06,250
obviously you can't transmit so but if

424
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:09,520
you're transmitting in a closed system

425
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:11,290
that's perfectly legal and being white

426
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,570
haps we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> never do anything in Eagle</font>

427
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:16,379
obviously so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main</font>

428
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:16,379
consideration

429
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:22,419
however I suspect if you if you use not

430
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:24,880
too<font color="#E5E5E5"> much power in a normal antenna you</font>

431
00:22:22,419 --> 00:22:26,860
would easily override the signal that's

432
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:32,350
being received from 20 miles away<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

433
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:34,659
know so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just a suspicion yeah so</font>

434
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:37,330
keep your gain low so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't blow up</font>

435
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:44,380
your TV because who wants to buy a new

436
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:47,740
60 inch TV right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so as I said I put</font>

437
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:52,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">all these in but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to go to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

438
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:52,320
demos and hopefully everything will work

439
00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:12,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so the first demo is we're going to</font>

440
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:15,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">start a receiver in one window and then</font>

441
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:24,790
i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use AV comp to capture my</font>

442
00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:26,770
webcam and send it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that receiver</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

443
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:30,070
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> during this so this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the output of</font>

444
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:31,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">the TV on the other screen and during</font>

445
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:35,049
this demo I'm going to have to retune

446
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:37,780
for each demo if I was attacking your

447
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:39,700
home so someone asked me I<font color="#CCCCCC"> gave this</font>

448
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:42,490
talk to a small group in London and<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

449
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:44,890
of the questions was yeah but if you

450
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:47,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to keep retuning the dead thing</font>

451
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:48,820
that doesn't work I mean yeah you could

452
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:52,059
stand outside with your own remote and

453
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:54,580
retune the TV but in practice I would

454
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:56,740
match my signal to what was that

455
00:23:54,580 --> 00:24:00,149
particular home was already tuned to and

456
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:02,470
it will only be one of four or five

457
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:05,200
transponder frequencies and sets of data

458
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:08,620
that they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be looking at so so this is</font>

459
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,809
just for the demos I have to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so</font>

460
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:16,030
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is going to be really hard</font>

461
00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:17,500
because I can't see what's going on yeah

462
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:20,910
if you want to turn up the volume on the

463
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,910
receiver now that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be great</font>

464
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:37,340
set up automatic I can't switch off the

465
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:40,359
parental control I don't know why ok so

466
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:40,359
I'm going to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> scanning</font>

467
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,460
this is what I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> really nervous of</font>

468
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:58,060
course this works every time in the

469
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,060
hotel room

470
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay excellent</font>

471
00:25:20,029 --> 00:25:36,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so in theory it should be yeah so</font>

472
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:41,869
suddenly if you see me waving on your TV

473
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:43,759
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm set outside in the car okay</font>

474
00:25:41,869 --> 00:25:57,320
so for the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the demos I'm going</font>

475
00:25:43,759 --> 00:26:01,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use a new radio companion for those</font>

476
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:06,918
unfamiliar with Software Defined radio

477
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:09,649
this is what enables complete noobs like

478
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:13,309
me who know nothing about analog to do

479
00:26:09,649 --> 00:26:15,859
cool stuff with<font color="#CCCCCC"> sdrs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just draw</font>

480
00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:19,099
block diagrams you drop in inputs and

481
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:22,908
outputs and then magic happens you know

482
00:26:19,099 --> 00:26:25,668
and stuff comes out so what this<font color="#CCCCCC"> does is</font>

483
00:26:22,909 --> 00:26:28,759
it generates Python which is then

484
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:31,820
executed for you so I've got a number of

485
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:34,489
different pre-recorded transport streams

486
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:37,899
and each time I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to enable</font>

487
00:26:34,489 --> 00:26:44,269
the next one and start transmitting so

488
00:26:37,899 --> 00:26:50,959
if I kick this one off again we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

489
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:57,019
retune the TV even though it's coming up

490
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:58,729
I know people<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to retune so this one</font>

491
00:26:57,019 --> 00:27:02,450
is only one channel and this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

492
00:26:58,729 --> 00:27:03,080
check so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a existing transport</font>

493
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:07,399
stream

494
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:20,418
audio channel so cool yes and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

495
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:26,719
the kind of stuff i watch<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so to say</font>

496
00:27:20,419 --> 00:27:30,470
mall that one and they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> work one so</font>

497
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:33,919
the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> question was can i transmit a</font>

498
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:36,230
stream that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has multiple channels and</font>

499
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:38,710
data services and all that stuff already

500
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">in there</font>

501
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,700
you

502
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,710
you

503
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:32,200
and this is the very first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time they've</font>

504
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:34,360
had to find a house for<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the two of</font>

505
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,950
them so their search continues and

506
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:38,229
fingers<font color="#E5E5E5"> crossed it won't be too long</font>

507
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:40,270
before they found<font color="#E5E5E5"> their new home in to</font>

508
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:42,820
see you next time on escape to the

509
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:44,889
country just a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit there if you'd</font>

510
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,570
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to escape to the girl</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and thank you</font>

511
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:48,520
for your help so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the loop</font>

512
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:52,000
it's just so this is an entire

513
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:55,030
transponder so when your TV's tuning

514
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,150
it's tuned into one of you know three or

515
00:28:55,030 --> 00:29:00,340
four transponders which each have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bike</font>

516
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:02,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">a multi sex channel so as well as the</font>

517
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:04,870
the multiple streams within a program

518
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:07,240
you've also got multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> programs</font>

519
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:12,489
they're nested so here I've got very

520
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:15,010
first time they've had some PVC of 1957

521
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:21,790
busy too bright lights<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the showbiz</font>

522
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:24,460
world if you'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask me to cpu</font>

523
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:31,090
load on my machine should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> almost</font>

524
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:33,820
nothing it turns out Barry and Jackie

525
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:36,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> totally free of our properties but</font>

526
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:38,050
none of them individually quite hit<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

527
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,180
spot and that was really down to

528
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:42,280
location their hesitation is

529
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:44,530
understandable this is a major move for

530
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,450
them their nest is emptying and this is

531
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:49,600
the very first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time they I mean I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

532
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:51,880
passing data to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> factory and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the heck</font>

533
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,550
Karthus days hasta be too long before

534
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:57,330
they found their new home in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Devon see</font>

535
00:29:54,550 --> 00:30:00,639
you next time on escape to the country

536
00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:03,399
so yeah this is we're currently sending

537
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,350
and I forget what it said 10 TV channels

538
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:09,120
and 16 radio<font color="#E5E5E5"> channels or the other way</font>

539
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:12,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">around and not even breaking a sweat</font>

540
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:15,250
pretty amazing properties so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an</font>

541
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:17,710
example of if a channel is not actually

542
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:19,390
broadcasting at a time the hesitation

543
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:21,540
and you'll get a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of anything</font>

544
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:24,190
keeping up to tell you nest is empty

545
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:26,860
sometimes you get another audio<font color="#E5E5E5"> trailing</font>

546
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:29,260
bleeding in and actually sometimes they

547
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:31,840
use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a message to say you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

548
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:34,120
retune your TV because they're moving

549
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,230
things around so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the screen will</font>

550
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:38,479
actually say if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can hear</font>

551
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:40,520
the video channel from another channel

552
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:45,020
then please<font color="#CCCCCC"> ritu or if you can see an</font>

553
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:54,370
image behind this and please retune so

554
00:30:45,020 --> 00:31:02,600
that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other thing that's</font>

555
00:30:54,370 --> 00:31:05,110
potentially interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess this is</font>

556
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,110
really hard

557
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:21,870
so what's interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is you can</font>

558
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:24,000
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the signal strength isn't that good</font>

559
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:28,379
but the quality is nearly one hundred

560
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,090
percent so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> sending you know that</font>

561
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:33,300
the hack RF is doing a really good job

562
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:39,090
of sending that data stream like error

563
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:40,649
rate is absolutely miniscule so yeah at

564
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:43,409
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I had to worry about</font>

565
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:45,420
getting the power up but not<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all you</font>

566
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:50,790
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually deliver a really low power</font>

567
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:53,880
signal and still get still get a working

568
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:55,950
stream so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> really good from the</font>

569
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,630
point of view of if I you know if I want

570
00:31:55,950 --> 00:32:01,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do this in practice and beam it to</font>

571
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:03,630
someone's home antenna I probably don't

572
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:17,909
have to amplify it that much to override

573
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:22,860
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> external signal I find another BBC</font>

574
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:25,530
oh yeah I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just blows me away I</font>

575
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:28,830
can transmit 10 TV channels whose

576
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:30,840
offices teachers 16 radio fills the

577

house of<font color="#E5E5E5"> commons with rebuilt you to</font>

578
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:45,959

579
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:48,240
Monsieur on quite hit the<font color="#E5E5E5"> spot and that</font>

580
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:50,370
was really down to location their

581
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,740
hesitation is understandable this is a

582
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:54,510
major move for them so in theory if I

583
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,430
didn't read back the very first time

584
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:58,620

and fingers<font color="#CCCCCC"> crossed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it won't be too long</font>

before<font color="#E5E5E5"> they found their new home in</font>

588
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:12,870
Devon see you next time on escape to the

589
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:18,910
country<font color="#CCCCCC"> should I be busy to ya</font>

590
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:22,199
right up can you do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the goats</font>

591
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:27,820
why do you hate me manali you know what

592
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:30,220
you all know seven<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are oh oh ok so</font>

593
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:32,250
we're as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as all that the sounds and</font>

594
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:41,890
video we're also transmitting at these

595
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:45,540
the whole winter ice cream and that can

596
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:48,430
include<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the program is break killer</font>

597
00:33:45,540 --> 00:34:04,560
re so yeah we seem to have all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

598
00:33:48,430 --> 00:34:08,460
elements already want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it sorry</font>

599
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:08,460
boring process again

600
00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:04,490
so no hackers day is complete without a

601
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:06,260
game of solitaire and I mean this is

602
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:09,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">just to kind of demonstrate just how</font>

603
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:21,260
powerful that it's languages you can do

604
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:27,490
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna play an easy game so anything</font>

605
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:27,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">that can do there no just pour a card</font>

606
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:45,970
yeah so you get the idea so okay i can<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

607
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:49,060
can go and grab that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ace be me yeah so</font>

608
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:49,060
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool</font>

609
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:59,420
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is another channel with a</font>

610
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:01,099
different MPEG program on there and this

611
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:04,549
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try and do a network</font>

612
00:36:01,099 --> 00:36:11,150
connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can switch actually you can</font>

613
00:36:04,549 --> 00:36:13,069
kill this<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know why it's all</font>

614
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:16,369
messed up on that channel this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

615
00:36:13,069 --> 00:36:18,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">pre-rolled demo transport stream that i</font>

616
00:36:16,369 --> 00:36:23,510
downloaded from a<font color="#CCCCCC"> valper and they make a</font>

617
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:28,670
bunch of test tools if we switch

618
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:30,859
debugging on you can see the message

619
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:32,450
basically it's trying to test if<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

620
00:36:30,859 --> 00:36:34,848
network is present<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font>

621
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:37,939
plugged into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can't</font>

622
00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:43,160
actually do a network test but you can

623
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:52,579
see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually trying ok and if</font>

624
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:56,029
i press start again you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the so</font>

625
00:36:52,579 --> 00:37:01,369
if you remember in my sample code there

626
00:36:56,030 --> 00:37:03,530
was this URL so what it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing</font>

627
00:37:01,369 --> 00:37:06,020
now if we had an internet connection is

628
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:08,420
connecting to that URL downloading<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

629
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:11,270
transport stream and streaming it yeah

630
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:14,180
so clearly<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just change that to my</font>

631
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:19,730
own URL get it to connect to whatever

632
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:21,890
service I like and bingo I think when

633
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:23,569
I've been doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> this testing I I suspect</font>

634
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:25,549
that streams been sitting there for

635
00:37:23,569 --> 00:37:27,170
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and no one's looked at it and</font>

636
00:37:25,549 --> 00:37:29,359
suddenly in their logs there's all these

637
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:31,490
messages popping up that transport

638
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:33,650
streams being collected because about

639
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:36,709
two weeks ago it stopped working so I

640
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:46,240
get a 404 not found now if I go to that

641
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:46,240
extreme it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of funny</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so</font>

642
00:37:49,180 --> 00:38:11,899
final one so I'm just going to get into

643
00:37:54,170 --> 00:38:34,160
the tune menu before we start I go past

644
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:48,500
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh weird</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is where the demo</font>

645
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:50,660
gods do hate me so these use there are

646
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:52,190
under runs from the hack RF so it's

647
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:54,649
saying it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting any data for</font>

648
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:56,830
some reason I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to try that</font>

649
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:56,830
again

650
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:37,930
oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being a dumbass it</font>

651
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:40,240
happens so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to deliver</font>

652
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:42,399
the stream surprise surprise so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

653
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,890
a live attack so this is simulating what

654
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:48,070
would be happening if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was man</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

655
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:51,120
middle so this first command would be

656
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:54,510
receiving the original programming

657
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:57,040
throwing it into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifo and then having</font>

658
00:39:54,510 --> 00:40:01,720
manipulated it stripped out the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

659
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:04,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">stream and replaced it with my own the</font>

660
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:08,200
second one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just adding timestamps to</font>

661
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:11,470
keep the stream happy so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if i run that</font>

662
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:13,799
again there we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so now we have</font>

663
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:13,799
date

664
00:40:25,789 --> 00:40:31,439
so for this demo<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just used that</font>

665
00:40:28,579 --> 00:40:34,229
transport role as my source that the

666
00:40:31,439 --> 00:40:36,449
demo<font color="#E5E5E5"> role if I was attacking you</font>

667
00:40:34,229 --> 00:40:38,759
obviously I would choose whatever

668
00:40:36,449 --> 00:40:41,999
channel I saw you watching because it

669
00:40:38,759 --> 00:40:43,469
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a live stream so I imagine</font>

670
00:40:41,999 --> 00:40:48,319
you're sitting at<font color="#E5E5E5"> home you're watching</font>

671
00:40:43,469 --> 00:40:48,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">TV and this happens</font>

672
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:24,790
yep so that was it for the demos thank

673
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:28,640
you so as I said all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the that the</font>

674
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:36,890
demos are in the slide so when you want

675
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:47,180
to have a play so that's it any

676
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:56,410
questions no<font color="#CCCCCC"> stunned silence where's the</font>

677
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:56,410
pod<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get an early</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lunch</font>
