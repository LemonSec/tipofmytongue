33
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:04,350
we go to access to it so um the whole

36
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:12,310
out and these access points in his

38
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:19,569

if there are any wolves in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> access</font>

40
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:26,109
points so the hardware guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> at your NW</font>

41
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:31,090
got hands-on and finally found some

66
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,298
disclosure process that's the thing we

67
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:05,709
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> got Iran w it was published yesterday</font>

68
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:09,250
I didn't hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the guy from the cisco</font>

69
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:13,120
guy the whole month so yesterday there

70
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:17,108
was mail in my mailbox and yeah he was

71
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:19,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">asking if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he could already publish it</font>

72
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:23,289
and I said yep do so fine for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me fun for</font>

73
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,590
you timeline will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be displayed later and</font>

74
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:28,070
also white paper

75
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:33,710
will be issued I think beginning of next

76
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:38,000
week so let's hack it this is the piece

77
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:43,159
B of the access point there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,130
people connectors like here very very

79
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,310
empty headers so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> so let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some pin</font>

80
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:54,110
headers on it so we could easily connect

81
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:59,270
like here here here under the earth

82
00:04:54,110 --> 00:05:03,740
shields different MC use or socks also

83
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:05,900
here's a USB port which is behind the

84
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:09,380
sticker on the back of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the access point</font>

85
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:12,320
because they have no use for it what I

86
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:15,530
already know is that this access point

87
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:19,610
is not only used by Cisco<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's also used</font>

88
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:22,070
by I think it's netgear for different

89
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:27,650
purpose so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no GTA last tunnel</font>

90
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:32,630
to company and such things yep there's

91
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:39,138
also NAND flash and some footprint for

92
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:42,260
thing spy flash um yep I only<font color="#CCCCCC"> worked on</font>

93
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:47,510
the USB<font color="#CCCCCC"> port was also disabled and as I</font>

94
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:50,000
remove the sticker yeah about your yacht

95
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:52,849
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> check we will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk later</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also about</font>

96
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,470
an end I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is also cheytac</font>

97
00:05:52,849 --> 00:06:01,250
header the traces are going to the Wi-Fi

98
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:05,990
chip so yeah it was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> big</font>

99
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:08,210
interest for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok what we think we've</font>

100
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:10,520
got so far said to use P what's hidden

101
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:15,229
behind a sticker and disabled we have a

102
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:18,440
broadcom sock we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> MIPS arc problem</font>

103
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:23,050
is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> broadcom you don't get data</font>

104
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:26,630
sheets in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wild also micronics none</font>

105
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:29,240
there is it easy to get a data sheet

106
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:33,110
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are che attack and another</font>

107
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:36,770
debug header so<font color="#CCCCCC"> step-by-step</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

108
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:38,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">gathering arm data sheet not in a wild</font>

109
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:41,510
for nand flash

110
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:44,270
yep pin outs of the headers it's easy to

111
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:46,699
get them by<font color="#E5E5E5"> measuring with multimeter</font>

112
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:49,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">che check you laters pretty handy to</font>

113
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:54,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">shine arrow or by use of illogical and</font>

114
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:56,419
lysis so this wasn't a big deal I'd also

115
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:58,729
try to interface with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the use and with</font>

116
00:06:56,419 --> 00:07:01,099
USB and why he faced answer but it was

117
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:03,169
disabled and also it was documented

118
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:09,680
somewhere in cisco judgments that it's

119
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:12,320
not enabled um he up to you out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

120
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,289
sex exponent loves to talk a lot so

121
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:20,360
there are lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of debug output what was</font>

122
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:23,060
pretty useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> started like this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> told us</font>

123
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:28,550
emits a cafe running on it and it's

124
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:32,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">brought come FEMA environment and yep</font>

125
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:35,570
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some memory addresses</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> key state</font>

126
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:39,948
is I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> three or four times mentioned</font>

127
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:43,130
while booting so this was of interest we

128
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:45,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">tried to boot from the golden image this</font>

129
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:54,400
was also<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interest later on under</font>

130
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:58,310
linux kernel 2.4 point 20 so this was

131
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:01,638
with the most useful information for

132
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:07,340
cheytac we<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed later and here again</font>

133
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:09,289
the key states he stayed lock<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i had</font>

134
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:14,060
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem there was lots of information</font>

135
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:18,050
no login possible it was not interactive

136
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:19,760
and anything like<font color="#E5E5E5"> control c won't work</font>

137
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:22,120
while booting so he quickly interrupted

138
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:27,979
to get into some kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> bootloader</font>

139
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:30,199
asset cafe yep but they are popped up

140
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:34,900
one message m several times and it was

141
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:39,469
the key state so this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked he was</font>

142
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:40,939
locked in small letters and our device

143
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:44,000
was really locked and that's what's the

144
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,839
matter why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't interface and why</font>

145
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,519
are you

146
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:49,709
so what could<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could dry and</font>

147
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:53,130
give up what's no option because it's

148
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:58,319
paid work we could also dump the nand

149
00:08:53,130 --> 00:09:00,720
flash which I hate I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hate it I so</font>

150
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:04,769
I'm so unsuccessful with damping

151
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:09,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">manflesh I don't like them okay you</font>

152
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:11,760
straight hack yeah but why it's not

153
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:15,959
needed at first<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

154
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,399
hands dirty don't know if they're in

155
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,989
English if there's an English

156
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:22,199
translation for Hector that I talked to

157
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:24,540
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> scalp editor there's the nand flash</font>

158
00:09:22,199 --> 00:09:30,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">i prepared it with some insulation tape</font>

159
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:34,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">to don't short some pins because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

160
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:37,439
already lost the device doing this<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

161
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:41,939
the idea was let me try to boot from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

162
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:46,350
golden image which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the starting the</font>

163
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:48,449
OS of this access point yeah the idea

164
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:52,380
was to<font color="#E5E5E5"> interrupt it here while is it</font>

165
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:54,810
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to boot so the Ascension by</font>

166
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:58,139
preventing the device from booting to go

167
00:09:54,810 --> 00:10:00,930
an image it will go into some kind of

168
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:07,139
recovery mode<font color="#E5E5E5"> or a boot later coffee</font>

169
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:09,420
will pop up so I see as I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

170
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:13,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">system have to be has to be on the nand</font>

171
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:15,479
flash<font color="#CCCCCC"> I try to do it this way so we have</font>

172
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:19,440
data inputs and outputs in the nand

173
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:22,130
flash and I just thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay connect</font>

174
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,529
him to ground in just the right moment

175
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:27,810
the right moment was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem because</font>

176
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:30,029
the right right moment was just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

177
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:33,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">frame from about few hundred</font>

178
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:41,189
milliseconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah and doing this by hand</font>

179
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:42,630
is hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay in this picture</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what</font>

180
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:45,870
we didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want was to golden image</font>

181
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:49,529
allowed to fail I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fail but not</font>

182
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:51,660
this way so this validation<font color="#E5E5E5"> failed and</font>

183
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:54,180
the system went into holes or try to

184
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:58,990
reboot sometimes

185
00:10:54,180 --> 00:11:03,939
yeah when I was successful I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

186
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:07,600
good in train after some tries it failed

187
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:15,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the console came up so I got a</font>

188
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:20,970
caffee and this had a lot of options<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

189
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:24,579
could read flash reflash it angel and

190
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:33,449
manipulate<font color="#CCCCCC"> g environment variables and</font>

191
00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:37,000
also get key sath key so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Eric cool</font>

192
00:11:33,449 --> 00:11:38,800
problem was okay if I use<font color="#E5E5E5"> that key my</font>

193
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:46,149
prick my device so it's not useful

194
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:50,229
anymore therefore are here right set key

195
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:57,699
had value in<font color="#CCCCCC"> hex which was an ASCII MFG</font>

196
00:11:50,230 --> 00:12:02,170
one sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> like manufacturing blah so I</font>

197
00:11:57,699 --> 00:12:06,250
end up again get key so I get lock what

198
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:11,199
was what i was already expecting sucky

199
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:15,010
had a problem yeah you couldn't enter

200
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:19,240
any value so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't accept any</font>

201
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:21,819
parameters so it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> one-time thing you</font>

202
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:25,660
said it but you can't set any other

203
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:30,600
values here as i entered set key you

204
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:35,860
remember it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> manufacturing 12 value</font>

205
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:38,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually it started to engineering there</font>

206
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:43,269
was another<font color="#E5E5E5"> key not a key set then it</font>

207
00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:46,359
told me so I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

208
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:48,310
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> I reboot it that's what only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

209
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">only option i could do see if it break</font>

210
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:57,399
tour what else but it turned out this

211
00:12:51,819 --> 00:13:00,670
was good so open so some it has no more

212
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:05,379
key state locked just<font color="#E5E5E5"> testing its memory</font>

213
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:10,149
and running up also here

214
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:12,519
he stayed<font color="#E5E5E5"> in it and it came up with in</font>

215
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:15,549
basic<font color="#CCCCCC"> books so this was after your</font>

216
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:24,429
system as i pooted<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had access to the</font>

217
00:13:15,549 --> 00:13:26,739
pc box yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i crawled to the folders</font>

218
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:33,639
how to look on everything what's running

219
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:37,720
on it and yeah came up some things so

220
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:43,139
the in Aspen<font color="#E5E5E5"> where different programs</font>

221
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:48,509
available also binary of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bootloader</font>

222
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:55,959
and yeah also<font color="#E5E5E5"> kept up and which is the</font>

223
00:13:48,509 --> 00:14:00,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">access point um using to connect this is</font>

224
00:13:55,959 --> 00:14:03,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">a what is it called it's a control</font>

225
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:05,889
protocol for lightweight access point so

226
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:09,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have a wireless LAN controller at</font>

227
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:11,589
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> company's side and the lightweight</font>

228
00:14:09,369 --> 00:14:15,039
access point roll out anywhere in the

229
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:22,899
field<font color="#CCCCCC"> on-site or like this one at a home</font>

230
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:26,529
of the company's worker yep finally a

231
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:33,069
reason why we are here not for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

232
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:35,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">search these are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> flats interest but for</font>

233
00:14:33,069 --> 00:14:40,049
this one's so there's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> route sword</font>

234
00:14:35,979 --> 00:14:44,739
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> manufacturer installed sword and</font>

235
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:51,129
the corresponding private key<font color="#E5E5E5"> I check</font>

236
00:14:44,739 --> 00:14:55,929
this by openssl got an md5 hash above

237
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:58,259
pop keys so they matched and we got what

238
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:58,259
we wanted

239
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:05,079
fortunately with<font color="#E5E5E5"> katermukke and the</font>

240
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:07,949
party<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the access point isn't</font>

241
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:10,839
working anymore so if you rebooted and

242
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:18,128
it tries to connect to the wireless LAN

243
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:22,899
controller you will have no success it's

244
00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:24,910
an engineering<font color="#E5E5E5"> mode and yeah always when</font>

245
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:28,509
they try to relegate<font color="#CCCCCC"> their certificates</font>

246
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:32,050
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> build up DTLA</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Adichie last tunnel it</font>

247
00:15:28,509 --> 00:15:36,939
fails there's only one encrypted package

248
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:40,889
and after this it fails so problem was

249
00:15:36,939 --> 00:15:44,759
and how do I get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> again back to the</font>

250
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:49,269
tube<font color="#E5E5E5"> working state to the key state lock</font>

251
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:53,339
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> this was not possible why are</font>

252
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:59,230
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are as it yeah as the reset key</font>

253
00:15:53,339 --> 00:16:04,540
program doesn't accept any values<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

254
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:12,750
church actually rescue this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

255
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:12,750
nice to use but<font color="#E5E5E5"> first it didn't work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

256
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:19,720
hooked up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to check you later which</font>

257
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:23,439
outputs nothing and also measure<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

258
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:26,350
voltage with multimeters there was also

259
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:35,099
nothing except of ground on the second

260
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:37,600
pin row yep so I put off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RF shields</font>

261
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:41,199
of the broadcom sock where the whole

262
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:46,750
system was running on and follow<font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font>

263
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:48,729
headers from the jtech had assumed

264
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:53,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">chetak header which was down here so</font>

265
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:59,249
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not on the pic yeah and here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I got</font>

266
00:16:53,110 --> 00:17:02,589
some empty footprints for resistors

267
00:16:59,249 --> 00:17:06,870
there are no resistors on them but the

268
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:11,910
traces which I followed I'm with an

269
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:15,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">continually tester let here so</font>

270
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:18,920
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought okay what could happen two dy</font>

271
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:25,260
system isn't working anymore so let's

272
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:30,420
play some solo joints here and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

273
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:32,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking very nice because you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> usually</font>

274
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:36,720
could reach<font color="#CCCCCC"> them because they're so tiny</font>

275
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:40,050
just with some sodium wire but this

276
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:44,340
didn't work for me so i used some tiny

277
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:50,790
wires to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Seoul urea and yeah it worked</font>

278
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:55,439
so doesn't matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> jaytech works okay we</font>

279
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:58,129
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this not so cheap try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shakti Packer</font>

280
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,230
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> segar which is called an trailing</font>

281
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:08,010
which is cool when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it works</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cuz it's</font>

282
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:10,140
fast and yeah and it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> so nothing</font>

283
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:14,100
like the bass blaster which was when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

284
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:17,070
used it always pretty slow but the

285
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:20,070
problem was the second tools don't have

286
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:24,750
built-in support forum its architecture

287
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:29,429
and yeah i'm not a big friend of open

288
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:32,880
Oct is it's very awesome but if you try

289
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:35,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get it working the first time yeah</font>

290
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:39,210
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that easy you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to read a</font>

291
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:42,780
lot and yeah googling<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit i found a</font>

292
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:46,560
simple script which has made my life

293
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:49,710
easier this way it provides a femur

294
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:52,379
recovery script and only needs a

295
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:57,390
modified port file in the board file

296
00:18:52,380 --> 00:19:02,220
there is some info about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CPU or the</font>

297
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:08,450
sock which is used and also the flash

298
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:11,570
banks and partitions the system uses so

299
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:16,040
remember this one and this is what the

300
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:21,480
AP spits out when it's booting so this

301
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:24,629
operations we need and yep

302
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:29,820
here's a GF here this is the certificate

303
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:33,480
store in here is the sort of cisco sign

304
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:36,659
third and also the private key in here

305
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:41,820
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some parts of the system which it</font>

306
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:43,470
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to boot in veeram in rear em in</font>

307
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:50,870
here are the settings<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the whole</font>

308
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:54,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">cisco things and yeah again ki</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a dumped</font>

309
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:57,510
this one I dumped everything because I

310
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:01,650
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be on the safe side but as I had</font>

311
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:05,129
a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the key and partition I got</font>

312
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:11,490
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> one so it's just right backward md</font>

313
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:13,580
engineering one here the hex and what

314
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:20,580
could happen if we place this by just

315
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:24,299
again lock yup did so flash it which

316
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:27,960
chip some time and again he aquí stayed

317
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:34,168
locked and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing was working</font>

318
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:36,570
nice again in the memory<font color="#CCCCCC"> times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I said</font>

319
00:20:34,169 --> 00:20:38,880
you could find everything else I think

320
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:42,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">there are much more wolves inside cuz</font>

321
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:48,799
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the software they use is Freddie</font>

322
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:52,350
hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> there they tell you it's USU air</font>

323
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:54,360
doesn't matter nobody uses this access

324
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:58,409
point anymore I don't know if there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

325
00:20:54,360 --> 00:21:00,299
customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> out who use this and yeah you</font>

326
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:01,880
could just use pin walk to extract the

327
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:05,400
files this works<font color="#E5E5E5"> well for the</font>

328
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:08,760
certificates and the private key there's

329
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:12,030
in squash FS used so yeah pretty

330
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:14,850
standard things some words about the

331
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:18,720
disclosure process at your w we usually

332
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:23,159
do the responsible disclosure way so we

333
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:26,940
did here disclosure timeline was pretty

334
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:30,510
long for this one on the second of May I

335
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:34,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">met at cisco cert which is the product</font>

had a lot of trouble regarding PGP cuz

346
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:09,840
my cisco contact has no damn kid<font color="#CCCCCC"> GP key</font>

347
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:12,960
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> service so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I wasn't aware of his</font>

349
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:25,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">so it's true I think about eight</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nine or</font>

ten tries until he got it yeah on 29th

351
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:35,160
of tune they told me<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we will block</font>

352
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:38,969
you art on boot but it can't disable

353
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:42,060
cheytac without physical changes as I

354
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:44,910
don't have a data sheet from broadcom I

355
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:48,500
don't know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is true</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

356
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:53,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're usually some fuses which you can</font>

357
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:56,630
disable so it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work anymore also</font>

358
00:22:53,490 --> 00:23:00,570
there would be no Krypto possible so or

359
00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:03,470
yeah so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily read it all the</font>

360
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:07,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">time the keys and suds and they</font>

361
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:11,310
announced the bootloader update which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

362
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:14,870
haven't got so far yep yesterday the

363
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:19,919
case waiting was made public by Cisco

364
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:22,699
they told I asked him for some document

365
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:27,030
page or anything like that and my

366
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:29,340
contact told me but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sea we as we to</font>

367
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:32,610
rating was too low for in security

368
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:36,360
advisory because the product seems to be

369
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:40,570
eos and AOL and so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> cisco doesn't</font>

matter this yep

371
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:49,750

00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:55,539
demo cause it yeah the sir you are thing

374
00:23:52,600 --> 00:24:18,100
and it's so time sensitive<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope I have</font>

375
00:23:55,539 --> 00:24:31,840
a still hand to do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's the</font>

376

way it's running that's my last you had

377
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:40,418
left so the other access point blew up

378
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:43,690
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Monday there were some problems while</font>

382
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:58,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">can also enter the bootloader mode</font>

this size

397
00:25:54,040 --> 00:26:02,770
this AC so yeah I scratched some more

398
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:06,220
from the PCP to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> access on the trace</font>

399
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:10,210
solar some tiny wire on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> solar it's</font>

400
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:14,110
directly to the pin header and fix it

401
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:18,180
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> blue tack if anyone knows this so</font>

it's working<font color="#E5E5E5"> but yeah okay let's try the</font>

403
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:40,930
uart bootloader thing up and hope this

404
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:45,060
works nope I said it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time frame</font>

405
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:45,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">from about 100 300 milliseconds</font>

406
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:12,780
yeah it failed so system hold<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

407
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:19,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">one's too early when I did this a lot of</font>

411
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:51,910
nope<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but we are lucky so i didn't</font>

412
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:56,430
use this access point a long time so I

413
00:27:51,910 --> 00:28:01,170
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know about the key state and as I</font>

414
00:27:56,430 --> 00:28:04,600
tried it before an hour ago I saw this

415
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:07,660
access point was already unlocked and

416
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:13,449
locked also it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible by</font>

417
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:21,910
hitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> ctrl C to get into the CFE call</font>

invert colors sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> no problem yeah</font>

421
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:21,160
that's a bad thing and presentation when

422
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:30,010
you use a tool that you don't usually

423
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:36,790
use and which is not in your yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

424
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:43,930
sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm hope this works somehow yeah</font>

425
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:46,200
