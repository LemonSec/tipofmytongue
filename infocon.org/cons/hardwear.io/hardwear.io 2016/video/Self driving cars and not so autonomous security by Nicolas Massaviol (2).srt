1
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:09,299
Gretchen everyone and Nicholas masovian

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:13,320
I see just<font color="#E5E5E5"> said I'm a co-founder of</font>

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:16,080
token system and security<font color="#CCCCCC"> enthusiasts</font>

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,029
I'm a third french guy today so you

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,089
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> end up having some weird accent</font>

6
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:24,539
at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day don't worry you</font>

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,060
will pass so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> to also to talk about</font>

8
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:31,890
cars so let's second talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> cows</font>

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:34,500
today so this that will probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> be some</font>

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:38,090
of the stuff you we<font color="#CCCCCC"> already saw this</font>

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,160
morning<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to go quickly over it</font>

12
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:44,730
so it's about the self-driving cars and

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:48,440
the knots autonomous security because as

14
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:52,140
we will see security is not automatic

15
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:56,789
when we deal with carton with cars so

16
00:00:52,140 --> 00:01:00,899
what's the agenda today ah see that here

17
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:03,420
gender so the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is we're going</font>

18
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:06,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through a quick recap about was a</font>

19
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:10,200
modern car nowadays what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,699
expecting to see not from the material

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,260
mechanical point of view but from the

22
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,770
electronic point of view which is

23
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,900
interesting for us for hiking next<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll</font>

24
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:23,250
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through how we can find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

25
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,750
vulnerabilities how we tried and managed

26
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">to find some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of those vulnerabilities</font>

27
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,030
because we're working on cars for about

28
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:33,780
three or four years<font color="#CCCCCC"> now that least two</font>

29
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,310
major manufacturers we will also go

30
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,689
through how not to find some

31
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:44,729
vulnerabilities because to be honest we

32
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:48,089
we plan on having a new ECU we from one

33
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:49,740
manufacturer that we didn't research

34
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,829
before and have some new things to

35
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:55,500
present to this talk but actually we

36
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:57,600
made a lot of mistakes and this is part

37
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,479
of the failures and we'll try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to explain</font>

38
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:06,949
why we went through this phase so you

39
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,950
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> can not do the same errors again</font>

40
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:13,850
the next topic<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be finding back</font>

41
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:15,800
doors we saw this morning a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

42
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:18,440
some of the deagle back doors that are

43
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:23,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">included in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ecu's we will go through</font>

44
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:26,480
all of them that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can think of and last</font>

45
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:28,820
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be part on the autonomous</font>

46
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,890
driving and the autonomous vehicle in

47
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:33,500
itself what are the future challenges

48
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:38,510
and what are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to face in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

49
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:41,300
next couple of years so what's a money

50
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:43,459
car nowadays so from an electronic point

51
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:46,430
of view it's a graph or network made

52
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:48,560
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> nodes there are ECU's so easy use</font>

53
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:51,370
stands for electronic control units and

54
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:55,880
they're connected with the canvas

55
00:02:51,370 --> 00:03:00,700
they're also connected to<font color="#E5E5E5"> all sensors or</font>

56
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:04,850
actors through various different

57
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:08,149
physical interface so it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be 3g 2g</font>

58
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:13,730
for external communications lvds for

59
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:16,580
screen can be linear to have some access

60
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:20,570
to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sensor usually there are</font>

61
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:22,820
multiplexed but basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the the</font>

62
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:25,880
idea is they they have a network

63
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:28,370
topology of acus and nowadays cars

64
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:32,030
usually end up with about 30 different

65
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:36,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">ECU's which are complete black boxes so</font>

66
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:38,450
one ec you can be compared to an

67
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:41,709
embedded device it's completely the

68
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:46,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">numbered device so you have 30 different</font>

69
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:50,300
ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> of approaching a device for one</font>

70
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,390
color and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the typical network topology</font>

71
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:56,300
is not driven<font color="#E5E5E5"> by security now the cars</font>

72
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:58,250
today were designed at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> four or</font>

73
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">five years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago and there were no</font>

74
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,960
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all so all the network</font>

75
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:05,870
topology<font color="#CCCCCC"> we seized today they are not</font>

76
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:09,430
driven<font color="#E5E5E5"> by security so you typically end</font>

77
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:12,260
up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so it's a complete mess and</font>

78
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:14,900
it's driven by functions and features

79
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:16,820
for example the multimedia if it needs

80
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,470
to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> access to the vehicle speed to</font>

81
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,170
display the vehicle speed on the

82
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:23,810
multimedia<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok we just connect this to</font>

83
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:26,060
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> canvas where the vehicle speed is</font>

84
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,260
produced so that's typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the engine</font>

85
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:31,100
for example

86
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:33,200
all the wheels<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same for</font>

87
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:37,010
everything so it's driven<font color="#E5E5E5"> by feature not</font>

88
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:40,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">security and we end up with architecture</font>

89
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:43,880
such as the Jeep which in the case of

90
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:46,240
2015 Charlie Miller and Chris valasek

91
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,380
demonstrated that corrupting

92
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,900
compromising the multimedia we could

93
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:52,730
just send random messages on the canvas

94
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:55,280
that would be directly interpreted by

95
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:58,880
the brakes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the engine so directly</font>

96
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:03,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">compromised this there's also the oubli</font>

97
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:08,200
port so this one is a special interest

98
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:12,020
because as we see earlier it's a the

99
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:15,020
typical way for deal is to request and

100
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:17,840
make some special privilege actions on

101
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:20,630
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ecu's the obd port is just that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

102
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,179
support is there is no<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy users no</font>

103
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:27,050
electronic it's only wires directly to

104
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:31,220
the internal<font color="#CCCCCC"> candle of the vehicles so</font>

105
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:33,350
that's one of the architecture we may

106
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:36,380
stumble upon a second one that is a

107
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:38,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit better we have a good central</font>

108
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,580
gateway that is responsible for

109
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,450
dispatching messages between the

110
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:46,640
canvases so usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it's a better</font>

111
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:48,380
design because inside the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gateway you</font>

112
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,140
already have some kind of firewalls

113
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:53,930
because the messages would only be

114
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:55,909
routed be if they are known unknown

115
00:05:53,930 --> 00:06:00,920
messages are not routed and<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially</font>

116
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:04,070
if you happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to send some breaking</font>

117
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:06,320
message on the multimedia bus that is on

118
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:09,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">the other side you won't get routed to</font>

119
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:12,530
the a to the engine<font color="#CCCCCC"> other breaks so this</font>

120
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:15,050
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the better design but once again it</font>

121
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:17,359
wasn't designed with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security in</font>

122
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:19,460
mind so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might end up with some</font>

123
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,890
additional easy use such as on the right

124
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:24,830
here which bypass is completely the

125
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:27,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">gateway so it makes a bridge between two</font>

126
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:33,250
buses because hey some feature need that

127
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:33,250
so typically

128
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:41,850
this this kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of architectures are</font>

129
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:46,740
there they are everywhere on every color

130
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:48,630
nowadays interestingly the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tesla that</font>

131
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,460
was supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have this kind of</font>

132
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:54,060
architecture with a gateway central

133
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:56,549
gateway yesterday got hacked so some

134
00:06:54,060 --> 00:07:01,710
chinese subsidiary of tenzin they

135
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:04,530
published exploit demonstration and on

136
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:07,080
the exploit of a multimedia system and

137
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:11,340
they were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send bright commands</font>

138
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:14,490
and the other kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of privilege requests</font>

139
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:17,340
to the brakes and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the engine so it</font>

140
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:20,520
was supposed to be also the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gateway like</font>

141
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:23,820
but then compromising the multimedia

142
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,950
just give access to the whole canvas so

143
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:29,300
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have technical report yet so</font>

144
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:33,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not sure which of the different</font>

145
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:36,900
architecture there are using but if they

146
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:38,700
use the this topology they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

147
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:47,820
pipe it inside the vehicle and to

148
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:50,340
compromise the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gateway also so a little</font>

149
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:55,320
bit about the canvas just a quick

150
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:58,880
reminder so what's the canvas it's used

151
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:01,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">to transport messages the messages are</font>

152
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:04,800
roughly like that you have a start of

153
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:08,580
frame an ID that can be 11 or 29 bits

154
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:13,350
the length<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data it could be 0 2 64</font>

155
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:16,500
bits the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CRC and an end of frame so it's</font>

156
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:19,440
designed for transporting messages in a

157
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:22,230
trusted environment and does this at a

158
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:26,730
very decent it does a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> decent job at</font>

159
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:31,230
this it was never<font color="#E5E5E5"> intended to be used in</font>

160
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:37,140
hostile environments so it was designed

161
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:39,719
like this and one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to remember that</font>

162
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:42,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">I DS Arnott</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> regreses 1ac you may have</font>

163
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,700
many many IDs can produce many many

164
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:47,220
different messages with different IDs

165
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,760
you can read many different IDs also so

166
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,570
those

167
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:54,439
not addresses also the data that it

168
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:57,420
contains are usually bit fields so

169
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:01,440
doesn't really make any sense to talk

170
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:04,650
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> bytes here it's really bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> field</font>

171
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,650
for example the engine frame with the ID

172
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:11,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">one a9 may have three bits for the</font>

173
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:14,340
engine<font color="#E5E5E5"> state on of that does it have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

174
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,990
key on<font color="#E5E5E5"> o key off eight bits for the</font>

175
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:18,930
rounds per minute and five bits that are

176
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:22,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">reversed for reserved for later use for</font>

177
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:25,530
example and this whole design is

178
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,570
completely proprietary<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's so back it</font>

179
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:30,390
changes between OEMs it changes between

180
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:33,470
make and model of the same OEMs so once

181
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:37,770
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have done the work of reversing the</font>

182
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:40,890
whole message sets that is on some kind

183
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:42,510
of one car<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you cannot port this to</font>

184
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:46,110
another car you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the work all</font>

185
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:49,260
over again so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where some nice</font>

186
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:54,270
tools come in like a competitor for

187
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:57,660
example and i'm pretty sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> no one</font>

188
00:09:54,270 --> 00:10:02,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">has done any study at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> physical level</font>

189
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:05,610
so some habits may appear and<font color="#E5E5E5"> packet in</font>

190
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:08,850
packet i'm pretty sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> 99% sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

191
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:18,420
this will<font color="#CCCCCC"> work on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the canvas but there's</font>

192
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:20,940
no tools available to do this so what

193
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:23,069
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we interested in is a not all easy</font>

194
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:27,750
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> because 30 and better device</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to to</font>

195
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:31,410
audit is it a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> too much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we are</font>

196
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:33,780
mainly interested in two kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of acus</font>

197
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:36,600
they highly exposed one such as the

198
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:38,579
multimedia system the telematic<font color="#E5E5E5"> unit the</font>

199
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,100
ve<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2x so that's vehicle-to-vehicle</font>

200
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:44,640
communication unit<font color="#CCCCCC"> or the vehicle to</font>

201
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:47,610
infrastructure unit and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they highly</font>

202
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,590
privileged ones so the ones that are

203
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:52,200
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make the car accelerate brake</font>

204
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:55,770
austere that would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the engine the</font>

205
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:58,770
brakes obviously and more recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

206
00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:00,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">ada system ADA's it stands for advanced</font>

207
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,139
driver assistance system we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

208
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,618
about it in

209
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:06,720
the autonomous driving it's the one that

210
00:11:04,619 --> 00:11:09,779
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> responsible for the intelligence of</font>

211
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,970
the autonomous driving the ESP to

212
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:16,369
correct trajectory so all those kinds of

213
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:16,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">ECU's are interesting for us to attack</font>

214
00:11:19,189 --> 00:11:26,089
so now we know now that we have the

215
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:29,759
targets how do we find vulnerabilities

216
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:32,699
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually it's pretty standard in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

217
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:36,749
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware point of view and it's</font>

218
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:39,358
pretty easy so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go for the debug</font>

219
00:11:36,749 --> 00:11:41,730
interfaces first thing because usually

220
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:44,669
either they're open<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're here so</font>

221
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:48,179
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first one not complicated at all the</font>

222
00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:50,879
server console you are it's usually you

223
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:55,108
found those everywhere you have four

224
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:58,139
pins here the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next classic hint that</font>

225
00:11:55,109 --> 00:11:59,850
there's a something going on and you

226
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:01,949
usually end up with some kind of menus

227
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:04,999
or outputs even if you don't have

228
00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:08,998
<font color="#E5E5E5">interactive shell you at least have some</font>

229
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:11,669
logs or sensitive<font color="#E5E5E5"> information they got</font>

230
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:13,709
printed on the on the serial console

231
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:17,100
here so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first thing you go</font>

232
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:20,368
for you usually have them unless some

233
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:24,269
people like<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the car makers you</font>

234
00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:27,509
shouldn't do this and even if they paid

235
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:30,389
attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this usually you still find</font>

236
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:33,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">some of them so that's the first one</font>

237
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:37,519
really classic second one we<font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

238
00:12:33,569 --> 00:12:39,689
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> morning a jtag</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> axis</font>

239
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:43,410
so that's another kind of debug

240
00:12:39,689 --> 00:12:46,829
interface depends heavily on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the supply</font>

241
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:50,129
is awareness if its present or not you

242
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:53,758
can it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually open we haven't found</font>

243
00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:57,600
in the first place when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we attack when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

244
00:12:53,759 --> 00:13:01,049
see you we never saw a closed one right

245
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,869
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the start sometimes sometimes it's</font>

246
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:05,639
protected by password and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's near</font>

247
00:13:03,869 --> 00:13:09,209
impossible to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it locked completely</font>

248
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:10,949
due to share responsibilities in case of

249
00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:14,638
malfunctions what you have to understand

250
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:16,099
is that when the supplier is responsible

251
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:21,360
for

252
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:24,449
supplying a ECU then when the ECU is

253
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:27,899
malfunctioning it returns from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> field</font>

254
00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:31,800
so you the<font color="#CCCCCC"> car maker takes it out for</font>

255
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:36,360
analyzing and the analysis in itself

256
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:38,389
uses those<font color="#E5E5E5"> jtag ports and if the</font>

257
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,519
supplier is not able to analyze this

258
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:44,069
then he's not his responsibility so the

259
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:47,879
car maker has to pay so that's a

260
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:50,399
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> of who's paying what and when</font>

261
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:54,990
money is in question then security

262
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:57,420
usually suffers so it's really really

263
00:13:54,990 --> 00:14:00,420
hard to get this properly done so

264
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:03,240
removing jtag completely is near

265
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:05,969
impossible usually we can have some kind

266
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,829
of password access hopefully not the

267
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:14,670
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> password for all units but it's</font>

268
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:17,128
different different difficulty here next

269
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:20,550
thing is to attack the memories so to

270
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:23,069
get the firmware the<font color="#E5E5E5"> code be able to</font>

271
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:26,248
reverse it and analyze it another is

272
00:14:23,069 --> 00:14:29,639
this so classical methods here i'm not

273
00:14:26,249 --> 00:14:34,319
going teach anyone everything the

274
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:38,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">eeproms really easy to dump with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the in</font>

275
00:14:34,319 --> 00:14:43,469
circuit<font color="#E5E5E5"> even main you don't have to</font>

276
00:14:38,689 --> 00:14:46,079
solder it out more difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> to land in</font>

277
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:52,019
North flashes usually have to solve to

278
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:59,008
solder it out and make some extra tools

279
00:14:52,019 --> 00:15:01,559
to go and read it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> emcs</font>

280
00:14:59,009 --> 00:15:03,660
which are the easiest one they have

281
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:06,360
embedded microcontrollers so you can

282
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:08,879
reliably read and write to them using

283
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:12,449
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example the standard SD card reader</font>

284
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:14,269
you just connect the right pins so you

285
00:15:12,449 --> 00:15:18,329
still<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have the pin out with the</font>

286
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:23,520
usually standard so<font color="#CCCCCC"> MMC's are really</font>

287
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:26,160
cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this in it in the further</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

288
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:30,120
data on those memories are never

289
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:34,949
encrypted just never happens embedded

290
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:37,170
devices so the supplies answer is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh too</font>

291
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:41,250
costly to implement this and it will

292
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:46,550
cost the penalty of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> percent in</font>

293
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:50,880
performance so no we won't implement it

294
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:53,900
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing you go for is the update</font>

295
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,550
files so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> one really interesting</font>

296
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:59,189
way of obtaining the firmware on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

297
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:02,130
code to find some vulnerability usually

298
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:04,530
they're not in plain text so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> still</font>

299
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:08,370
have to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> some transformations to get</font>

300
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:12,720
to the actual firmware but it's some

301
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:15,630
kind of encryption so the encryption we

302
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,840
only saw one implementation using proper

303
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:21,420
cryptography with the key properly

304
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:25,770
stored in the targets the child the key

305
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:29,280
was encrypted using the targets unique

306
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:32,340
device key and this was hard to break

307
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:35,130
but not<font color="#E5E5E5"> impossible other use cases they</font>

308
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:39,480
all use some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of weak obfuscations</font>

309
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:40,920
night<font color="#CCCCCC"> file system splits you have 10 10</font>

310
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,370
files that you have to place in the

311
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:48,199
correct order in it<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh hi system and</font>

312
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:52,170
short passwords on zip files and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

313
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:57,120
proprietary obfuscation technique here

314
00:16:52,170 --> 00:17:01,349
and there's one you usually can get them

315
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:03,450
on the website<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the manufacturer for</font>

316
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:07,380
the multimedia systems because they are

317
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:09,750
huge files so they<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually want the user</font>

318
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:14,640
to update these for the multimedia

319
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:17,640
system very easy to get the firmware if

<font color="#E5E5E5">not if you are going for miss you inside</font>

321

322
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:26,400
servers which stores all the update

323
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:29,040
files they are mandatory to publish

324
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,280
those for independent dealers so you can

get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the defense directly on the on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

329
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:47,940
the ECU so it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really practical but</font>

330
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:51,860
at least you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go on the servers and</font>

331
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:54,540
get the code so once you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the code</font>

332
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:56,280
there's two possibilities either the

333
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:59,550
classic reverse engineering which you

334
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:01,740
all know if it's arm-based and the dead

335
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:04,909
linux so they are usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the multimedia</font>

336
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:07,650
system and the telecom<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCU</font>

337
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:09,420
telecommunication units it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

338
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:12,650
similar to smartphones it's the

339
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:15,150
classical UNIX so nothing new here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

340
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:19,050
there's also a<font color="#E5E5E5"> nutso classic reverse</font>

341
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:22,500
engineering so this one is a will be a

342
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:27,780
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> lengthy process you usually have a</font>

343
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:30,059
huge variety of microcontrollers inside

344
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:32,960
each<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those ECU's and they're very</font>

345
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:35,100
exotic very particular sometimes they're

346
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,710
specially designed for automotive

347
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:41,040
industry and you never encounter them

348
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:45,750
other other than in these places so you

349
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:51,210
have to EV 850 many versions yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> 120 h</font>

350
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:53,400
you have the 38 k 0 and pc 5 x ts pick

351
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:56,970
whatever there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different</font>

352
00:18:53,400 --> 00:19:00,350
architecture and of course very few

353
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:03,090
tools very few documentation the

354
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:07,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">chipmaker usually don't publish this</font>

355
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:13,770
very easily and they also are very old

356
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:16,440
so the v8 50 version<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 for example 2003</font>

357
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:21,600
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I remember correctly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's only</font>

358
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:23,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">beginning to appear in modern ECU's so</font>

359
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,110
the very first step is having a clean

360
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:27,780
disassembly and then you can hope to

361
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:36,979
reverse something but this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

362
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:36,980
lengthy process but once you have

363
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:44,419
then you can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some very interesting</font>

364
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,840
things example this was found only

365
00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:50,270
telematic units so there's you were

366
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,000
looking for what version<font color="#CCCCCC"> of openssl is</font>

367
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:54,980
this you see you<font color="#E5E5E5"> using for example so</font>

368
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,289
you grep open<font color="#E5E5E5"> its cell and then you</font>

369
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:59,440
stumble upon this string to make the

370
00:19:57,289 --> 00:20:04,520
random generator think it has entropy

371
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:10,429
yay that's the initialization vector so

372
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:12,620
good we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some DD the gap between</font>

373
00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:14,630
what we saw in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous presentation</font>

00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:16,699
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> laura1</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for example and the</font>

00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:25,909
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> ECU's are huge mean is it's</font>

377
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:28,130
completely crazy here that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also the</font>

378
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:30,860
telematic units they also are built or

00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:35,870
usually around<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sarah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wireless modems</font>

380
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:40,279
they r SL six seven eight and they use

381
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:43,760
the open a te operating system and this

382
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:52,029
is what in 2015 they embed the openssl

383
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:54,980
released 101 c which is up to date right

384
00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:57,649
very nice open in<font color="#E5E5E5"> cfl version and it's</font>

385
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:59,840
it's in the it's not even in the current

386
00:20:57,649 --> 00:21:07,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">easy use because the currently used do</font>

387
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:09,320
not embed this version of open<font color="#CCCCCC"> 80 so</font>

388
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:12,919
let's switch to how not to find

389
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:16,399
vulnerabilities now we we happen to get

390
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:20,539
Volkswagen<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy use for use of this</font>

391

392
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:24,559
reproduce what we do for our clients but

393
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:27,320
for someone that has nothing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with</font>

394
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:30,408
<font color="#CCCCCC">us so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can publish but we did</font>

395
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:33,049
everything wrong here so we end up

396
00:21:30,409 --> 00:21:37,010
burning the units and learn nothing so

397
00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:39,049
what steps not to make to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:41,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">find some vulnerabilities well the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font>

one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is have multiple identical parts</font>

400
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,010
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very important because you will</font>

if you only have one

403
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:55,450
then it's game over so when you're doing

404
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:59,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">this either you have a recovery plan or</font>

you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably fail so breaking is</font>

406

00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:34,330
that's for the camp badger that we saw

earlier if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> fuzz blindly your 100%</font>

some function than routines that erase

420
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:45,100
the whole memory for example so if you

421
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:49,360
do this blindly you will fail so that

we are going to dump the the flash so we

do solo the flash and nothing works so

talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this didn't work so</font>

435
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,750
what looks like an<font color="#CCCCCC"> EMC might not be</font>

436
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:34,090
readable with standard tools for example

437
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:38,830
and what looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a SATA interface</font>

438
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:43,860
because we saw some hard disks in BMW

439
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:46,629
for example and the SATA disk here is a

440
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:49,540
regular SATA interface but it will not

441
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:51,610
respond<font color="#E5E5E5"> to standard skazhi commands so</font>

442
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:54,280
not readable withstand the tools they

443
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:56,800
implemented their own firmware so I

444
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:58,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know to to be able to meet some</font>

445
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:04,540
special features<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the other</font>

446
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:04,540
car so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not readable right away</font>

447
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:10,820
also some diagnostic functions that we

448
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:13,159
the can badger guys told told us about

449
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:15,470
they depend<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the vehicle state and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">zero they all have different states that</font>

455
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:34,370
can influence the diagnostic functions

456
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:37,870
and you end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up having very weird results</font>

457
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:41,510
if you don't take really<font color="#E5E5E5"> care about this</font>

up having to<font color="#E5E5E5"> order the manufacturer the</font>

469
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:17,960
you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> most probably end up with a</font>

nice collection<font color="#E5E5E5"> of jtag probes and then</font>

471
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,730
those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very expensive and like I said</font>

472
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,580
you have a whole range of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

software ever design is very very

00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:52,580
difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work with those tools it's</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">a huge mess and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reversing architecture</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the case for some of the</font>

than you<font color="#E5E5E5"> initially expected so it's time</font>

487
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:09,260
you might want to consider this when you

00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:11,059
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing some brute forcing attack and</font>

also the non read read

493
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:29,980
those are ways to waste time and destroy

the ECU that you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hack into</font>

495
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:38,419
let's go to finding back doors now so

496
00:26:35,149 --> 00:26:40,969
back doors they come very various forms

497
00:26:38,419 --> 00:26:43,639
we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of them and they</font>

498
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:46,330
usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> are present on all different</font>

499
00:26:43,639 --> 00:26:49,369
issues especially the multimedia system

500
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:53,389
hidden menus a special tap sequence you

501
00:26:49,369 --> 00:26:56,779
go into the photo settings tap once on

502
00:26:53,389 --> 00:26:59,508
the upper left twice on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lower right</font>

503
00:26:56,779 --> 00:27:02,590
and hope what developer menu you have

504
00:26:59,509 --> 00:27:04,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">some special debugging tools very</font>

00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:08,959
privileged functions that are accessible

506
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:11,749
etc so that's not a one-way encounter

507
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:16,820
with the konami code very popular very

508
00:27:11,749 --> 00:27:21,529
famous you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can also have some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stealth</font>

515
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:43,519
related to the multimedia but for

516
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:46,249
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> Volkswagen then the diesel gate</font>

517
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:49,789
that we heard in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the news when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font>

518
00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:54,889
detecting that the the trunk was open

519
00:27:49,789 --> 00:27:57,019
the rear right wheel was blocked and the

520
00:27:54,889 --> 00:28:01,418
battery was<font color="#E5E5E5"> proud charging all those</font>

00:27:57,019 --> 00:28:04,820
indicated that the it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a special</font>

522
00:28:01,419 --> 00:28:09,230
testing mode and then it outputs a

523
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:13,879
special results so those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all in the</font>

524
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:15,529
hidden menu category here and they're

525
00:28:13,879 --> 00:28:18,860
all discoverable by reversing the

526
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:21,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">firmware hidden features a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

527
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:25,860
the same here we happy

528
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:28,470
to see some implementations let<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you</font>

529
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:32,310
plug in the USB device with a special VI

530
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:36,060
d PID and you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a ssh cell without</font>

531
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:38,360
password that you can use directly they

532
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:42,450
open up a network interface on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> USB</font>

533
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:46,050
very practical so those are usually they

534
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:48,210
are developed during the development

535
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:51,659
phase at the supplier maybe the car

536
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:53,340
maker is not even responsible or doesn't

537
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:56,790
know about them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in the</font>

538
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:59,429
production units and it's all over all

539
00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:03,510
over the the multimedia system for

540
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:05,370
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> you may have some hardware</font>

541
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:08,310
jumpers or polyps that will end up

542
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:10,199
booting a special image with a

543
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:13,230
diagnostic interface that you can use to

544
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:17,370
read and<font color="#CCCCCC"> write directly to memory we saw</font>

00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:22,740
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> field or even better direct</font>

special USB that is not routed what's

548
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:35,300
this you plug it in oad be perfect so

549
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:40,290
other kinds of backdoors we talked about

550
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:42,000
some diagnostic and UDS previously with

551
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:46,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">a can badger so I'm going to go quickly</font>

00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">over this the diagnostic is especially</font>

you des in the most recent<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCU's as we</font>

554
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:54,570
already seen so you have different<font color="#E5E5E5"> sets</font>

555
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:56,790
of services you have changing sessions

managing sessions reset read and write

557
00:29:56,790 --> 00:30:01,110

00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:06,780
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like we already</font>

560
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:09,090
saw and there's also some kind of a tent

561
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:12,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">occasion with Rio x27 the security</font>

562
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:16,290
access guys over can better also talk

563
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:19,170
about this what they didn't dive into is

564
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:24,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the security access they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> usually</font>

565
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:26,320
special crypto custom crypto special

566
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:31,760
crap

567
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:34,389
so they it's just a series<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Zoar and</font>

568
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:37,279
shifts and that's called<font color="#CCCCCC"> curto</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

569
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:39,919
usually they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one ECU type one key</font>

570
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:42,860
so they sure they all share the same key

571
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:47,600
and guess what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key is a siren trick</font>

572
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:49,668
in 16 bits so very very interesting so

573
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:54,168
security access is there is no real

574
00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:58,940
security here and even in specifications

575
00:30:54,169 --> 00:31:02,390
so that's the iso standard this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what</font>

576
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:04,610
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are putting as an example seed of</font>

00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:07,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">the server for example and say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay key</font>

578
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:09,049
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two bytes see to bite it's</font>

579
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:12,770
a challenge response and then you sign

580
00:31:09,049 --> 00:31:15,559
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> site you anchor it the seed with</font>

581
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:20,690
the key and it and you feed this back to

582
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:26,000
the to the ECU to authenticate real real

583
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:29,809
crypto in the UDS you also have other

584
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">kinds of backdoors the service 31 is</font>

585
00:31:29,809 --> 00:31:36,350
routine they call it we call it routines

586
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:37,908
in the UDS is functions and reality so

587
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:41,600
the calling convention is standard but

588
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:44,539
they are all different they are special

589
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:47,559
to the ECU special to the OEMs and they

590
00:31:44,539 --> 00:31:50,799
are defined by whoever wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

591
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:54,789
implement them so the car makers are

592
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:57,168
defining a set of routines but then

593
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:59,779
nothing prevents the supplier from

594
00:31:57,169 --> 00:32:02,539
including other ones if they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not used</font>

595
00:31:59,779 --> 00:32:05,419
by the car maker<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I can use some</font>

596
00:32:02,539 --> 00:32:10,070
others too<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know to make some</font>

597
00:32:05,419 --> 00:32:13,909
validations so what happens is that for

598
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:15,850
example go back a little bit the read

599
00:32:13,909 --> 00:32:18,500
and write memory by address which is

600
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:21,168
obviously bad thing from security point

601
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:23,929
of view just reads<font color="#CCCCCC"> new memory directly</font>

602
00:32:21,169 --> 00:32:25,789
and write to memory they used to

603
00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:28,940
protected behind security access now

604
00:32:25,789 --> 00:32:33,260
they forbid it completely so they

605
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:35,890
disable the service 23 and 3d but then

606
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:37,810
the supplier he needed he

607
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:40,450
maybe he needs it for for his

608
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:43,810
development process so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's he's going</font>

609
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:46,710
to do well implement special routines

610
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:50,590
that is just read and write by address

611
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:52,180
so you have a beautiful backdrop the<font color="#E5E5E5"> car</font>

612
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:54,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">maker doesn't know about it it's only</font>

613
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:56,800
use value supplier it's just the calling

614
00:32:54,700 --> 00:33:01,360
convention is standard you just use it

615
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:04,200
and dump the firm work there's also I Oh

616
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,219
controls to F that's another service

617
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:10,570
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really really interesting</font>

618
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:13,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it eats into does some actions</font>

619
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:17,110
on the ECU it<font color="#E5E5E5"> influence the output the</font>

620
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:19,720
functions of the ECU itself so you can

621
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:22,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">control the headlights for example so if</font>

622
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,770
you on the highway at night turn off the

623
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:27,070
ad headlight for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

624
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:31,650
interesting funny things happens you can

625
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:31,649
blow the air bag it's one UDS service

626
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:39,639
anytime interesting and trigger some

627
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:42,100
specific actions so it all depends on

628
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,960
the ECU<font color="#CCCCCC"> weather we had what the supplier</font>

629
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:47,379
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the car makers have implemented as</font>

630
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:50,080
IO controls and they may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be aware of</font>

631
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:55,150
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> i/o controls that were put into</font>

632
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:59,169
the ECU other kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> backdoors this is</font>

633
00:33:55,150 --> 00:34:03,880
a text then was taken from the Brazil

634
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:06,250
regulations it's a resolution<font color="#CCCCCC"> taken 2007</font>

635
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:10,510
it states that all vehicles should be

636
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:12,969
sold with anti-theft mechanism so to be

637
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:16,750
able to track and disabled vehicles

638
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:20,350
remotely so it's it's working on at the

639
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:22,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">GSM level no real authentication on GSM</font>

640
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:25,899
everybody knows and at the application

641
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:29,199
level well nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is planned for</font>

642
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:31,359
authentication either so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's kind of</font>

643
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:33,870
service that they are designing to

644
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:36,340
implementing the telemetric units

645
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:39,130
sending an SMS the car won't work

646
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:41,129
anymore no authentication plant what

647
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:44,710
about denial<font color="#CCCCCC"> of service here</font>

648
00:34:41,129 --> 00:34:47,379
very bad so what happens is that this

649
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:49,570
software for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Brazilian units they're</font>

650
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:52,330
exactly the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same as the ones that are</font>

651
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:54,820
sold in us or the Europe exactly the

652
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:58,210
same only configuration changes so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

653
00:34:54,820 --> 00:35:03,730
activate disable enable or disable the

654
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:06,130
service and this gets implemented so as

655
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:08,680
we saw configuration changes there are

656
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:11,350
baby protected by security access<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh</font>

657
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:16,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">security access not to secure what</font>

658
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:19,089
happens maybe i can send some SMS and

659
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:22,510
prevent your car from working this can

660
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:24,910
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> distributed own cars in a given area</font>

661
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:29,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'll disable for example could be</font>

662
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:32,020
interesting and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also the EU is working</font>

663
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">on similar features maybe they will</font>

664
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:36,220
implement some kind of authentication

665
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:40,750
for their service but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Brazilian one</font>

666
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:42,850
there's no authentication another one

667
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:46,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is completely unofficial right now</font>

668
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:49,240
the remote viewing they want to be all

669
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:52,180
cars now are equipped with<font color="#E5E5E5"> some cameras</font>

670
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:54,459
so and the autonomous driving it will

671
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:58,810
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> they all have a lot of</font>

672
00:35:54,460 --> 00:36:01,240
optical sensors cameras so that's a real

673
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:04,150
dream come true for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a surveillance</font>

674
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:06,339
business and the law enforcement and

675
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:10,060
agencies they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> investigating this</font>

676
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:12,520
what use can we do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these moving</font>

677
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:19,930
cameras on the road maybe we can

678
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:23,340
implement some recognition on this it's

679
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:25,810
also the the remote sound capture here

680
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:27,910
this one is already implemented and

681
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:30,910
already in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> high end cars and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will be</font>

682
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:33,790
who will become mandatory so the Sun

683
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:37,210
capture the you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> emergency calls</font>

684
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:43,650
that when the crash is detected it calls

685
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:48,090
automatically the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DA know the rescue or</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">dr. fireworks</font>

687
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:55,670
and it relays<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sound to know what</font>

688
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:55,669
happens in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> car and this capability</font>

689
00:36:55,850 --> 00:37:02,970
and how secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is this capability how</font>

690
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:06,830
much do you trust them to implement this

691
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:10,140
securely to have what will<font color="#E5E5E5"> it take to</font>

692
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:12,690
program a different call number phone

693
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:16,410
number inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> the telematic units to</font>

694
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:22,920
call I'd know someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else then just</font>

695
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:26,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">listen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to what happens in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the car okay</font>

696
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:29,640
let's switch to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the autonomous vehicle</font>

697
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:33,860
now and the future challenge so the

698
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:36,690
autonomous vehicles what do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly</font>

699
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:38,490
mean by the autonomous vehicle so

700
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:40,650
there's at least four or five levels

701
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:43,020
defined the level one is the driver

702
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:47,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">assistance it's already implemented</font>

703
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:51,300
already in the field 2015 so there are

704
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:53,790
just laying assist collision avoidance

705
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:56,370
so all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the systems they are driver sits</font>

706
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:58,800
and sits level one level two is partial

707
00:37:56,370 --> 00:38:02,250
automations the driver<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention is</font>

708
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:06,240
required<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all time so you have to have</font>

709
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:09,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">the hands on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wheels and be able to</font>

710
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:12,509
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> control the vehicle at any time so</font>

711
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:14,549
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> plan for 2018 testa is already</font>

712
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:16,650
there so they're bit in advance on the

713
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:18,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">on this global panic level three is</font>

714
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:21,330
conditional automations its<font color="#CCCCCC"> plan for</font>

715
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:24,569
2020 and this is what in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the marketing</font>

716
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:26,850
terms we call the autonomous vehicle the

717
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:29,160
driver attention is not required in some

718
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:32,310
conditions so when the conditions are

719
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:36,000
met<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example on the highway</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there is</font>

720
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:39,630
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sun good visibility then no the</font>

721
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,990

722
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:45,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">and do something else no driver</font>

throws away so no wheels and<font color="#CCCCCC"> pedals this</font>

730
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:06,279
is why we wear the car makers are

731
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:08,529
thinking when they are talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:12,160
autonomous vehicle and usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

733
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:16,540
level<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 so what we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand</font>

734
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:22,779
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the development cycles of those</font>

vehicles 2020 well the definitions the

736
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:29,880
technical definitions is already frozen

737
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:32,500
the research has well we will build the

738
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:35,770
autonomous vehicles for 2020 with

739
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:38,880
today's technology this is the roughly

740
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:42,250
theory about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> development process so</font>

741
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:44,980
the research take leave when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

743
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:50,230
car they stop freeze through the

744
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,600
research at point is at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point in</font>

745
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:54,670
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they take all the technologies</font>

746
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:59,230
that are available they put it into the

747
00:39:54,670 --> 00:40:01,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">car</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the development phase begins so</font>

748
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:04,510
the development phase is just the theory

749
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:09,549
of making all those technologies work

750
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:12,250
together it lasts about a year and next

751
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:15,730
the industrialization things be<font color="#CCCCCC"> faced</font>

00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:17,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">begins which is just testing validating</font>

753
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:19,330
that everything works correctly

754
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:21,490
according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a theory of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the development</font>

that that one that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a year and a</font>

756
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:32,069
half<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the theory so it's about at</font>

757
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:35,950
least 2.5 years frozen in time so 2020

758
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:38,230
it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now so they are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> making</font>

759
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:40,720
the autonomous vehicle with today's

762
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:47,950
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> of today so the security of</font>

763
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:52,690
today will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> implemented into the</font>

764
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:55,990
autonomous car so when you see when we

765
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:57,640
understand where they are currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

the state of the art for vehicle

security then we may have a problem here

768
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:14,160
so the autonomous vehicles they are they

769
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:16,589
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be connected or did it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

772
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:23,940
a many many functions that will be

778
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:38,490
your autonomous vehicle to go park

779
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:41,700
itself and then you call it back so you

780
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:46,049
expect it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back remote actions so</font>

781
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:49,710
the autonomous vehicle is it has to be

782
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:52,050
connected remote diagnostics so that the

783
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:53,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">car makers knows what goes wrong inside</font>

anything there's virtual keys in your

789
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:10,440
smartphone you won't have some physical

790
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:13,830
keys anymore and obviously there are

791
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:16,650
also some facebook poke him and go Wi-Fi

792
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:18,330
hotspot because well driver doesn't

793
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:22,200
drive anymore so you have to keep you

794
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:25,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">occupied do do something while the car</font>

795
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:28,649
is driving so all this means that the

796
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:31,080
autonomous vehicle doesn't work if it's

797

not<font color="#E5E5E5"> connected how is it autonomous</font>

798
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:40,319
anymore it's a maybe the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> choice of</font>

799
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:42,480
word here is the vehicle<font color="#CCCCCC"> itself it's not</font>

800
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:44,160
autonomous at all you know it heavily

801
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:48,060
depends on the network if you cut the

802
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:51,149
network no<font color="#E5E5E5"> not autonomous anymore many</font>

803
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:53,310
things won't work anymore driving maybe

804
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:55,470
little bit autonomous with the the

805
00:42:53,310 --> 00:43:01,190
vehicle itself it heavily depends on the

806
00:42:55,470 --> 00:43:04,209
network very poorly chosen word and

807
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:08,220
there's also

808
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:08,220
a bit of a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the trust model</font>

809
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:13,089
here you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have many many different actors</font>

810
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:15,009
in the ecosystem you have the drivers

811
00:43:13,089 --> 00:43:16,750
the car manufacturers Cal suppliers

812
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:18,670
infrastructure providers software

813
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:21,780
developers governments local authorities

814
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:25,660
service providers you have regulations

815
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:29,980
like iso sae you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's also us</font>

816
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:33,940
the hikers all those ecosystem have to

817
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:37,119
work together and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> a product that</font>

818
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:41,140
the driver can trust with his life so

819
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:44,740
that's the end the objective here that I

820
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:49,000
as a driver do I trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> all those</font>

821
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:51,368
ecosystem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make it safe and it's a</font>

822
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,540
real problem because<font color="#CCCCCC"> no one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> knows</font>

823
00:43:51,369 --> 00:43:58,420
exactly where the functions are exactly

824
00:43:54,540 --> 00:44:00,970
in the autonomous vehicle you will the

825
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:03,280
car will talk to the infrastructure for

826
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:05,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">example who is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> responsible for the</font>

827
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,730
security of this is it the

828
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:11,799
infrastructure itself is it the car

829
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:17,470
maker who do I trust so all this this is

830
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:22,660
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> broken here do you trust the</font>

all the software<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is built into the</font>

833
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:35,230

00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:37,000
are not able to assess<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security of</font>

do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> with autonomous vehicles because</font>

851
00:45:30,279 --> 00:45:34,210
we just saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the it has to be</font>

852

connected to provide the features that

853
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:41,589
we expect as a consumer device so all

854
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:49,420
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> it does mean that the the</font>

855
00:45:41,589 --> 00:45:51,729
challenges that are are really that we

00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:53,529
expect from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the autonomous vehicle would</font>

be one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the greatest challenge of this</font>

858
00:45:53,529 --> 00:46:03,220
the next let's say four years so the we

859
00:45:59,259 --> 00:46:05,859
have very low it takes this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is more and</font>

860
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:09,430
more people interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in to car hiking</font>

861
00:46:05,859 --> 00:46:13,989
today we have at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least two talks but</font>

862
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:15,970
it's a widely unexplored area right now

863
00:46:13,989 --> 00:46:18,640
so we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need some more people</font>

864
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:21,368
digging into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security of this whole</font>

865
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:23,229
domain because it will go we will have

866
00:46:21,369 --> 00:46:25,839
some autonomous vehicles it will happen

867
00:46:23,229 --> 00:46:30,700
it's not question of whether it will

868
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:32,078
happen but just one<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I'm going to</font>

869
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:35,669
stop here<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's only five minutes</font>

870
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:35,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">so I'm going to take some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> questions</font>

871
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:40,170
that's all thank you for attention

872
00:46:50,819 --> 00:46:58,660
where's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my gosh there's one thing I</font>

873
00:46:56,969 --> 00:47:08,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't think we have any time for</font>

874
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:10,710
questions right doing one well if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

875
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:13,450
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only one let's make it happen and</font>

876
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:16,390
so in terms of the you talking about the

877
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:18,519
autonomous vehicle yes but what is the

878
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:20,589
right role of governments in this

879
00:47:18,519 --> 00:47:21,700
because if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the Lakra security</font>

880
00:47:20,589 --> 00:47:22,900
researchers are going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find the</font>

881
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:25,808
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all those type of things</font>

882
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:27,969
but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes a compelling event for</font>

883
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:29,980
things actually to change so the first

884
00:47:27,969 --> 00:47:32,380
time that there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> real accident or</font>

885
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:34,060
death around<font color="#E5E5E5"> us and we're kind of seeing</font>

886
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:36,220
that happening in the US then this

887
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:37,900
legislation that's going to bring this

888
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:40,240
trust model it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring a</font>

889
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:42,460
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> spin on it so do you see that</font>

890
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,830
changing the landscape when regulation

891
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:46,480
steps in so think of the seat belt of

892
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:49,119
the car they<font color="#E5E5E5"> never used to have those</font>

893
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,920
until there was lots of car crashes and

894
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:53,140
then they said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now you have to put</font>

895
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:54,660
the scene so you think regulations also

896
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:57,580
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive this field even further</font>

897
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:58,660
yeah so obviously the regulations are

898
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:00,910
going to change the lace to the

899
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:05,890
landscape it's obvious it will happen

900
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:11,649
because they won't make it perfect at

901
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:14,589
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first time so what is really hard to</font>

902
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:17,890
say is that every car maker will have

903
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:20,890
its own implementation of the autonomous

904
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:22,660
system and their authorities would say

905
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:25,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay they they have to meet certain</font>

906
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:28,089
requirements but what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

907
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,430
requirements and if the car maker has a

908
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:33,000
better one but it's not compatible<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

909
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:37,000
the requirements do will it<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

910
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:39,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">downgrade his own algorithms to meet the</font>

911
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,859
government requirements it's the

912
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:44,560
regulations is will be very hard to

913
00:48:41,859 --> 00:48:46,900
define for autonomous vehicles because

914
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:50,500
it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay in this situation when</font>

915
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:57,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">visibility is 10 meters you have to take</font>

916
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:59,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">I know the the position of stopping the</font>

917
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:04,089
car on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the on the on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the side road for</font>

918
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:07,330
example but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what if something anything</font>

919
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:10,300
else happens at the same time and has to

920
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:14,049
choose maybe some some of the car makers

921
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:16,810
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> have better algorithms and others</font>

922
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:19,359
and how is the regulation going to

923
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:22,930
answer some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those questions it's a</font>

924
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:28,610
really hard hard question to answer this

925
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:34,899
right now yeah

926
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:34,900
any other no thank you thank you
