1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,120
some props

2
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,400

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,039

4
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,320

talk here and happy to be in the u.s um

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,400
today i'm going to be discussing

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,760
tractors and the importance of hacking

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,360
the agriculture and food supply chain

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,600
so let's get stuck into it

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,280
um just letting you know that none of

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,879
the research oh all of the research

12
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,719
today is conducted in um

13
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,239
good faith

14
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,440
um nobody paid for it nothing today

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,680
represents my employers

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,320
clients etc both both the past and

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,640
future all the content in the class size

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,719
is cc0

19
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,320
and all the other trademarks logos

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,960
belong to their respective owners

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,399
um just so you know i've never actually

22
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,920
owned a tractor

23
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,760
i'm not an expert and i'm always

24
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,960
learning so it's always a

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,119
cat and mouse game so i'm also not a

26
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,880
farmer

27
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,760
and

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,280
just yeah i'm not an expert again so

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,400
yeah

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,200
um there might be some more um

31
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,040
yeah there's plenty to come so yes in

32
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,920
the last 12 months i've just been

33
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,680
basically having a look at tractors i've

34
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,960
never actually

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,640
been inside one i've never actually

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,759
owned one

37
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,200
um

38
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,200
and

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,240
i'm not even fascinated by tractors but

40
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,400
it's just

41
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,159
it just so happened that

42
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,680
someone dared me to actually have a

43
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,079
crack at finding a cv in one of them and

44
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:42,960
um

45
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,280
next minute i became the de facto

46
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,759
tractor guy for some reason

47
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,280
um but it turned out it's pretty

48
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,200
important because um

49
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,600
you know the whole country runs on on

50
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,560
agriculture

51
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,520
and

52
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,119
mining and gas and things like that

53
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,600
actually most countries do actually so

54
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,000
i mean this was the first example of an

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,640
attack that

56
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,159
happened in the last 12 months which was

57
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,199
the colonial pipeline attack

58
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,760
which is pretty obvious took over

59
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,040
massive gas pipeline natural gas oil

60
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,319
things like that

61
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,640
and then after that we had jbs foods

62
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,920
which which they paid paid the massive

63
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,480
11 million ransom of and

64
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,520
that was that was an enormous ransom for

65
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,160
something that was actually being

66
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,480
handled by the fbi and the

67
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,080
you know usda and and

68
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,599
probably every other organization there

69
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,800
was

70
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,120
um same thing there got bare shelves

71
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,440
because there was no um

72
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,000
there was nothing to slaughter the beef

73
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,720
and the poultry and the chicken

74
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,640
and then we add the co-ops which is

75
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,640
shortly after that which is um

76
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,200
5.9 ransomware paid

77
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,760
and then recently adco had a ransomware

78
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,840
attack this is only a month ago and they

79
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,680
just recovered allegedly recently

80
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,599
and that was during u.s planting season

81
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,800
so

82
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,480
yeah significant impacts to

83
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,680
[Music]

84
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,599
the ability for farmers who have anchor

85
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,280
equipment and stuff to actually plant

86
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,840
seeds so

87
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,200
um and this has all been in about one

88
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,640
year so

89
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,720
uh yeah as i said fbi department of

90
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,599
transport five million dollars paid

91
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,400
this one here jbs foods

92
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,400
there was literally um

93
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,480
what are they called semis with full of

94
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,799
uh animals sitting at the slaughterhouse

95
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,560
waiting to actually get processed but

96
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,920
they couldn't because everything was

97
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,159
offline because they'd be ransomware 11

98
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,239
million dollar bounty paid

99
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,720
adco had secrets stolen

100
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,680
um

101
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,560
and they reported that yeah significant

102
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,799
data exfiltration has happened which is

103
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,879
obviously a concern because

104
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,200
you know if someone's got your firmware

105
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,879
your internal

106
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,799
documents you're pretty much um well you

107
00:03:58,799 --> 00:03:59,599
don't know what they can do with

108
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,400
obviously you've got to change

109
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,480
everything

110
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,319
uh as i said they're in-depth and

111
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,000
lengthy remediation recovery is required

112
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,840
um and follow-on attacks this is

113
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,840
directly from anco's statement following

114
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,840
attacks

115
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,798
maybe or expected

116
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,720
um

117
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,959
i think this is a quote from cops i

118
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,960
think it's like um you know cops have to

119
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,000
get

120
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,320
lucky every day but sorry

121
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,840
cops only need to get lucky once and you

122
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,919
need to get lucky every day

123
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,080
um like driving unlicensed or something

124
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,960
like that but um yeah manufacturers

125
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,560
they need to get lucky every day and i

126
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,160
just only need to get lucky once to find

127
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,680
a bomb so

128
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,600
so this is um this is the black screen

129
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,440
of death on a john deere

130
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,639
tractor

131
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,759
um

132
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,759
i'm pretty sure this is the windows ce

133
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,880
version

134
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,759
um

135
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,440
i may be slightly wrong but it looks

136
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,639
like it's yeah it's crashed into

137
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,240
recovery mode and given the font it's

138
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,720
obviously looking like it's yeah that's

139
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,400
the black screen of death on the on the

140
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,320
john deere you can see it in the top top

141
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,479
little bit there there's

142
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,800
it's covered in mog which is matter

143
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,400
other than grain

144
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,039
chapel um

145
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,479
yeah so

146
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,160
a couple of things keep in mind ag is

147
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,600
super competitive

148
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,320
there's a ongoing arms race and

149
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,160
autonomous farming has arrived uh it is

150
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,520
it's quite scary but it's not

151
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,199
necessarily

152
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,680
not necessarily bad i mean it's yeah

153
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,400
it's this is a lithium um

154
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,400
lithium i mean it's lithium-powered

155
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,919
lithium powered uh tractor

156
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,440
and um i think that's uh it can pull

157
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,639
you know it can go and automatically

158
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,800
plant your field and things like that

159
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,600
for water stuff so

160
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,840
competition brings speed speed brings

161
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,919
errors human errors mistakes things like

162
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:48,720
that

163
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,600
um

164
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,800
yeah and i just wanted to pose a

165
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,759
question

166
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,440
what happens when your hardware leaves

167
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,400
the factory so if you're a manufacturer

168
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,880
you're basically exporting your

169
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,960
entire code base to

170
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,639
somebody like the tools nowadays you've

171
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,039
got you've got ida you've got binary

172
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,680
ninja you've got you know d compilers

173
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,240
you can actually bring that

174
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,919
that actual compile code straight back

175
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,759
into source so you're practically

176
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,840
exporting your your entire code base to

177
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,800
to um

178
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,400
clients and customers so all of the old

179
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,400
hardware that you've got out there

180
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
if you're a manufacturer is just sitting

181
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,400
there waiting to be um

182
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,759
looked at which is kind of what i've got

183
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,280
here

184
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,360
so this is like a john deere telematics

185
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,759
gateway

186
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,639
it's really heavy it can stand up to 85

187
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,479
gs of force it's got like uh wi-fi

188
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,120
ethernet which is automotive in it

189
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,840
sim card cellular gps cellular and i

190
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,199
think there's another one that's got

191
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,639
even more of that but

192
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,960
we'll jack into this in a little bit

193
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,198
um

194
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,360
yeah the unintended recipient would be

195
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,000
me so uh

196
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,919
i've got four of these at home uh

197
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,919
they've got the 3g ones like i'm trying

198
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,360
to make a bit of a collection make sure

199
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,479
i've got all the

200
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:03,759
different versions and stuff like that

201
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,800
because i want to

202
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,280
compare what's been changed and see the

203
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,880
change log of files and things like that

204
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,919
and see

205
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,680
what's been fixed and then the old ones

206
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,120
have obviously got the bone still so

207
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,440
uh so yeah this stuff gets sold on tick

208
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,800
tock ebay

209
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,120
auction option websites wreckers which

210
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,360
is common dealerships obviously

211
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,880
and then a lot of farmers actually use

212
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,720
facebook and instagram to sell their

213
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,319
equipment so it's really hard to

214
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,639
actually keep track of where stuff goes

215
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,560
which country gets exported to and

216
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,280
whether or not that violates arms arms

217
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,840
things and things like that but

218
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,240
yeah so once it leaves the factory four

219
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,440
you've got the

220
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,960
online fcc filings trade secrets

221
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,960
hidden in plate site um

222
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,560
all the comments in the code you've left

223
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,599
in there they're all there as well

224
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,039
so this is the this is the john deere

225
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,199
fcc filing

226
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,080
code i'm pretty sure it's ob fil ib5 but

227
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,120
there's

228
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,360
quite a um number of

229
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,479
items in there and i've got a couple of

230
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,479
scripts that just download

231
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,319
the archives here as you can see here

232
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,080
we've got it's probably impossible to

233
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,440
read but it says internal photos and um

234
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,879
their new stuff they don't actually i

235
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,639
think they they released one about last

236
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,240
week

237
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,599
um

238
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,919
and it had no internal photos this time

239
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,919
so this one has internal photos which

240
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,520
i've got here

241
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,720
and this is what i've got here as well

242
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,840
if i can crack it open

243
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,599
yeah it's the same thing but

244
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,399
these are impossible to get apart

245
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,360
they're like they actually rip uh

246
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,120
they actually rip the nand flash off the

247
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,600
board when you when you

248
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,480
the uh

249
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,399
the al aluminiumizer if that's probably

250
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,600
a word but

251
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,200
yeah it's um

252
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,040
yeah they're a weapon and um i've cut

253
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,959
myself multiple times

254
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,600
trying to open those things so yeah

255
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,800
this guy i don't know how this guy

256
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,160
opened it so

257
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,800
mine's all busted up uh the glue on

258
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,160
there is the same glue as your telephone

259
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,320
so it's like that gorilla glue but

260
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,240
there's a lot of it and it's pretty much

261
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,000
yeah you've got to heat it up and then

262
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,200
it you know you've got risk of

263
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,440
destroying the board

264
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,880
but it's okay because you can just buy

265
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,040
another one on ebay um

266
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,720
there's plenty available and they drop

267
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,880
down in price i mean these are just

268
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,680
flying out the door uh 150 bucks you've

269
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,160
got 31 of them available

270
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,440
uh

271
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,440
99 bucks

272
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,279
and that's that's one of my ones i've

273
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,560
got four of them that's one of them

274
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,439
let's chuck that there

275
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,040
yeah so this one actually came without a

276
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,839
case it's a factory it was a mexican

277
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,000
factory unit

278
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,959
that

279
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,959
for some reason didn't have any epoxy or

280
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,839
that case on it it literally just came

281
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,760
uh from the factory so it was quite

282
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,480
strange don't know where it came from um

283
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,839
whether it fell off a truck or something

284
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,279
like that but

285
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,200
had to go at it you know like i said i'm

286
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,839
not an expert um i had a crack at the j

287
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,640
tag you later which is

288
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,320
i've got one upstairs but that's the j

289
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,920
tag later and the creator that's sitting

290
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,320
in the front row so yeah it's joe grant

291
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,839
um

292
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,640
yeah fantastic device i tried to hook up

293
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,120
to these pins up here

294
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,720
and i think that's how they program it

295
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,560
they won't tell me obviously but

296
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,800
there i assumed it was jtag or ktag

297
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,720
apparently automotive stuff some someone

298
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,880
will probably know a lot more about ktag

299
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,040
than me but

300
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,120
so it was just spitting out

301
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,800
spitting out jargon and i was going to

302
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,480
say it should be illegal to actually try

303
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,680
and attempt to

304
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,399
crack in a jtag without a j tag later

305
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,079
because it's uh if you haven't used one

306
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,279
before if you're not aware of how it

307
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,880
works it just

308
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,040
permeates or yeah it goes through all

309
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,800
the permutations

310
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,440
of every single combination of

311
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,760
the jtag pin out that you need and it'll

312
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,920
just spit data at you and

313
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,240
they've actually told me that the data

314
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,680
they got here is jargon anyway it's not

315
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,000
actually real and that's because

316
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,440
um

317
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,000
i was doing it wrong and also

318
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,160
doing it wrong and that was my first

319
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,720
attempt and then i dropped it

320
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,640
and then i just destroyed it and the

321
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,320
only little bit left was those tiny

322
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,040
little dots and the uh tiny little pin

323
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,320
outs

324
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,320
and

325
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,920
yeah i was having a crack at it just

326
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,720
gone through all these little

327
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,120
combinations of jtag

328
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,120
oh yeah this little thing here

329
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,360
this is a this little cjm

330
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,640
cu232h if you want to get some if you

331
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,839
want to get this hardware hacking just

332
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,680
by that it's like five bucks

333
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,720
it's got a

334
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,600
uh

335
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,720
it's got uh spi um

336
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,640
it's even got a logical analyzer as well

337
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,399
it's really weird it's like a

338
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,000
really cheap board it's an ftdi

339
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,600
yeah mega cheap so yeah i left the

340
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,600
device alone for a month

341
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,720
and engage with other hackers so sent a

342
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,880
few emails out for example joe joe was

343
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,399
helping me out for a bit

344
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,839
and turns out the flash was actually

345
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,040
empty

346
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,760
so

347
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,279
the whole time i'd been working on them

348
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,480
the whole time we've been working on the

349
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,200
device it was actually factory blank so

350
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,240
we were getting literally zeros um

351
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,079
and i couldn't understand why

352
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,480
but it turns out it was factory blank so

353
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,160
that's a hot air gun i've got one here

354
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,320
but it's um

355
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,399
this one's probably a bit too big

356
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,800
it looks like a hair dryer but it's um

357
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,079
you'd probably destroyed the board if

358
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,680
you actually had a crack at that one but

359
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,720
yeah i bought this one the other day

360
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,760
when i had a few beers and um

361
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,600
yeah it'd probably work because once you

362
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,920
actually take that nand flash off you

363
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,880
don't actually need the rest of the

364
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,560
board anymore because you can chuck that

365
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,279
inside a

366
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,680
inside one of these so this is like a

367
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,639
little

368
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,800
socket for nand

369
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,959
and just pop the

370
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:51,360
all hood

371
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,040
chop that like that and then just chuck

372
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,000
it in there

373
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,360
so that fits

374
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,440
in there and then

375
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,410
just close that

376
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,959
[Music]

377
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,959
tuck that in there

378
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,279
and then you can mount it into the um pc

379
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,959
so

380
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,160
um obviously you've got to clean it off

381
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,000
first because it's a mess and you can

382
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,160
see i actually took off the rails

383
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,399
it like took off half the um the actual

384
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,240
pcb when we

385
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,440
took it off and i've like i said i've

386
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,200
done a couple of these now and it rips

387
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,240
it off every time and i've heard from

388
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,240
other people it also rips theirs off as

389
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,760
well so yeah that's the socket thing um

390
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,200
it's uh

391
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,040
i believe they didn't actually

392
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,959
think that the sockets would be

393
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,639
available commercially before

394
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,079
full actually put that on the board

395
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,839
because it's unencrypted and you can

396
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,079
just read write to that disk

397
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,839
and actually put it back on the board

398
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,600
with a hot air gun as well so

399
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,079
it's universal so you can see that's an

400
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,279
upside down man on a um

401
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,240
on a samsung i bought a box of um

402
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,000
just old samsung's if you want to

403
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,440
practice with like

404
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,880
taking off chips and stuff and you don't

405
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,800
want to destroy one of those even though

406
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,680
you can get in on ebay easily

407
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,360
i recommend just getting going down a

408
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,120
mobile phone shop and asking them for a

409
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,279
box of destroyed androids and then you

410
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,639
get like you know you've got a practice

411
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,040
board you just keep ripping off chips

412
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,480
um

413
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,120
destroying boards burning things uh it's

414
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,000
pretty easy to do that actually

415
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
yeah so once we get it off

416
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,519
just a full root file system so

417
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,839
i mean after you do that you've got yeah

418
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,040
that's it you don't even need the board

419
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,320
anymore you don't need the nand anymore

420
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,279
you can duplicate this you can

421
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,519
split it up and obviously i did that

422
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,920
so a couple of partitions here

423
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,199
um

424
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,040
and i just moved everything into one and

425
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,440
just shoved it in a docker file

426
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,920
a dockerfile just did literally that's

427
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,839
the beauty of docker just from scratch

428
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,199
because it's got everything in that in

429
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,079
that actual um

430
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,880
inside that actual directory just add

431
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,639
all the files in there and then just run

432
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,480
the init

433
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,560
so i run it on x86 even though it's

434
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,120
supposed to be running on um

435
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,800
intel atom

436
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,639
but as you can see here we've got

437
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,800
we've got a screen here

438
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,560
um what i will point out one of the

439
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,440
vulnerabilities i i believe is true is

440
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,360
that you can turn off an on engineering

441
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,680
mode before you log in

442
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,360
so that

443
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,120
yeah that should probably be behind the

444
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,639
login screen

445
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,320
because obviously you would have if you

446
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,000
turn on engineering mode you'd probably

447
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,600
be able to disable login or something

448
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,880
like that so

449
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,320
um

450
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,759
yeah this is the this is the http page

451
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,079
running on it so it's probably a lot

452
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,240
more stuff to muck around with there um

453
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,720
it doesn't quite you know it's not um

454
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,360
yeah it's it's nice it's nice

455
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,079
um the temp folder was not in ram i'm

456
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,079
not sure how common that is on intel

457
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,680
atom but yeah there was files in there

458
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,360
so usually you know on linux and things

459
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,680
like that the 1040 gets smashed after

460
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,440
boot but someone could correct me if

461
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,040
that's wrong but

462
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,440
on devices like that but we had yeah a

463
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,600
bunch of databases things to edit in

464
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,120
there like um

465
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,920
like the onboard wi-fi password

466
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,360
jobs

467
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,120
s3 file transfer service um

468
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,680
uxdb obviously that section control

469
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,040
which is how you line up the tractor and

470
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,720
things like that

471
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,880
and

472
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,720
yeah just activations which is another

473
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,199
thing that um we won't talk about today

474
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,320
because

475
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,759
so

476
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,079
yeah it's uh activations of software and

477
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,440
things like that

478
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,880
uh

479
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,480
yeah so what i did discover as well was

480
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,880
this we found subscribe published cpp

481
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,600
example which was a

482
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,639
which is the sample code from aws to

483
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,079
hook up your

484
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,480
device over mqtt

485
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,079
um and if everyone's anyone's not

486
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,839
familiar with mqtt's

487
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,720
message framework um or that's how i

488
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,560
understand it to be but you subscribe to

489
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,920
it and you talk to the other devices on

490
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,000
the network

491
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,920
and

492
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,360
ended up finding the private key and the

493
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,880
public key

494
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,959
and

495
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,240
those files actually are in the same

496
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,079
directory as this file as well

497
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,319
so yeah that that root ca

498
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,599
available

499
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,520
port everything like that so

500
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,439
plain text and i actually sent that to

501
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,959
dear and they told me that it was

502
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,160
actually common to every single device

503
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,000
so

504
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,760
my face was you know i had a big smile

505
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,359
on face thinking then i could see every

506
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,199
single tractor in the world hooked up on

507
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,520
the same mqtt network

508
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,840
so we had a crack at that but and it was

509
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,960
actually

510
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,400
on the it was actually on every single

511
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,760
device

512
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,559
however the key wasn't actually in use

513
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,600
so

514
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,240
it was a dev key left in pride

515
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,480
but you know that's literally me right

516
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,559
there

517
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,960
like imagine finding a key that is like

518
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,280
a common to every device and it it's

519
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,960
just sitting there in pride so but it

520
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,360
wasn't indicated to keep you know to

521
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,039
keep going to keep actually finding

522
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,640
stuff because if there's other keys that

523
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,000
key's lying then there's probably going

524
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,440
to be more keys hanging around

525
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,880
and

526
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,480
another cool thing was protocol so

527
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,880
there's a whole bunch of um

528
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,559
a metric ton of

529
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,600
i think i'm going to be quicker

530
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,640
yeah a metric ton of shared objects here

531
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,039
that um

532
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,480
yeah would be worth would be worth

533
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,559
decompiling uh that's all the camber

534
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,400
stuff which is pretty helpful and i

535
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,559
assumed that some people would benefit

536
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,480
from that i personally don't have a

537
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,000
tractor i can't actually do much with

538
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,880
that but

539
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,080
there would be other people like

540
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,400
powertrain technicians or people who

541
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,640
want to create isobus apps which is like

542
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,440
a

543
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,120
if you've done like audio stuff before

544
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,240
it's kind of like a vst but for tractors

545
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,440
and

546
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,000
yeah the 500k board rate that's the

547
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,559
assume that's standard for can bus

548
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,400
and then um

549
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,080
yeah these are really valuable objects

550
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,360
that

551
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,200
people have been patently asking for for

552
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,200
um from from the manufacturer for a

553
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,640
while so

554
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,960
as i understand it so yeah and then um

555
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,799
yeah another one we found was the yum

556
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,760
repo which is public not public but the

557
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,120
username and password was transferred

558
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,520
was hard-coded into the device

559
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,039
but uh it didn't really need a password

560
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,720
anyway because uh it was just kind of an

561
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,880
obfuscation technique my username

562
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,480
password i think the password was spring

563
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,480
2013 so it wasn't too hard to guess i

564
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,840
mean it wasn't

565
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,000
i mean hasn't changed for nine years so

566
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,280
um

567
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,039
the yeah the username password you can

568
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,559
capture that if you download the

569
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,640
download manager and then just sniff

570
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,000
your own traffic and it'll send it out

571
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,720
of http so it was there and it was also

572
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,200
on the device so it's a common

573
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,280
it's on every device the same repo um

574
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,480
they actually

575
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,320
actually downloaded i think i downloaded

576
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,320
the next slide yeah four thousand rpms

577
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,080
off that repo

578
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,120
um which is about 250 gigs of

579
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,360
johnny of firmware that i want to look

580
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,520
at and have a have a play with

581
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,360
then they turned off the repo

582
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,120
directory listing so i've got a

583
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,160
yeah i'm going to muck around with that

584
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,320
for a bit um it used to be just one

585
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,799
massive uh list of 4 000

586
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,240
uh rpms

587
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,919
you obviously just set up a script and

588
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,880
and downloaded them all

589
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,320
uh

590
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,520
yeah so i just want to like to say that

591
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,600
it's pretty imperative like i don't even

592
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,919
scratch the surface uh and

593
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,280
there needs to be a lot of work done

594
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,880
because

595
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,039
it's like a 400 billion dollar company

596
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,080
there's a bunch of other companies

597
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,000
getting ransomware and not many people

598
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,280
are actually looking at it i feel a bit

599
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,480
alone

600
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,000
looking at it so

601
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,679
um

602
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,360
the bare minimums you'd probably need to

603
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,840
have a crack at it is just a hot air gun

604
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,760
a soldering iron and

605
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,600
one of these flash readers

606
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,880
and then you can just hack into pretty

607
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,440
much like every device that has an

608
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,480
emc

609
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,520
like

610
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,960
yeah you can

611
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,799
yeah the hot air gun's pretty important

612
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,400
because you want to take off the

613
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,520
chip you can't really do that with a

614
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,039
soldering iron and that's probably the

615
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,480
only prohibitive thing actually and the

616
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,720
soldering iron is just to clean off the

617
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,400
chip after because

618
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,559
otherwise i won't read in that

619
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,159
you could take it off with the hot air

620
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,520
so you could get away with just hot air

621
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,520
and the flash reader but

622
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,400
um

623
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,919
you'd probably be at a stretch so this

624
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,280
is the other one

625
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,559
this is another device that i'm looking

626
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,600
at from d and that's the lbj 100 chip

627
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,840
they call it

628
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,480
fbga

629
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,799
that one uh also has a socket

630
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,280
and you just need to change it with that

631
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,080
um

632
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,679
i just wanted to get into secondhand

633
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,080
chips so

634
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,840
these

635
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,400
are i just saw these on like uh

636
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,799
like for sale and i think and um i ended

637
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,120
up buying a whole bunch of uh

638
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,799
nand flash because some of the nand

639
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,640
flashes that we wanted to use

640
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,400
are actually out of production and you

641
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,520
can't get them anymore so you have to go

642
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,080
for second-hand chips or fake ones

643
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,840
and ended up getting a

644
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,760
tray of 32 gig nands from israel

645
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,200
and they were actually 32 megs when i

646
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,760
got them and open it up 32 megabytes so

647
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,520
they yeah i think i with that one

648
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,440
actually but

649
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,440
these um these obviously processes or

650
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,880
whatever whatnot but some of them

651
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,840
actually got

652
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,720
uh

653
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,159
they've actually got stuff left on the

654
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,679
device obviously take off if you don't

655
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,039
zero out the device then obviously

656
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,799
you've got data on there so all the

657
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,960
second-hand chips that you see online um

658
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,559
you can just go and then

659
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,159
pull out people's data

660
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,880
yeah so where i'm at now with it is um

661
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,640
wind river linux

662
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,840
apparently it's got wind river now they

663
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,159
changed the name recently sold

664
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,320
they're an embedded uh anyone that

665
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,679
doesn't know what they are i didn't know

666
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,840
what they were but they're like a

667
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,440
embedded distro that goes in like

668
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,360
missiles and things like that

669
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,520
and uh yeah so john d uses that for

670
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,000
their for their devices as well

671
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,039
and you can go on there because it's

672
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,280
linux based i mean it's distro sorry

673
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,480
it's a distro you can go and actually

674
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,679
download it

675
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,679
um and boot it on your

676
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,480
pc so that's the i think it's the

677
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,360
raspberry pi qmu version of it

678
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,640
which obviously you put on a real

679
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,640
raspberry pi

680
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,400
um

681
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,400
and the good thing about this is you can

682
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,919
actually

683
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,799
um i'll say that one a sec sorry you can

684
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:03,600
actually

685
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,320
get

686
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,000
files from the real device and put them

687
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,559
in there and it'll just run right so

688
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,799
inside the lost and found folder on one

689
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,280
of the devices was all of the rpms that

690
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,799
they had used to build that one so i

691
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,120
didn't have to go through 4 000

692
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,880
rpms

693
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,799
to actually find out which ones i needed

694
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,480
but i just went into the trash folder

695
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,240
which was not cleaned

696
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,600
well not they didn't forgot to empty the

697
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,840
trash on the on the prod unit so

698
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,520
um just went in there and downloaded all

699
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,200
the rpms and

700
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,400
just uh force rpm that it skipped check

701
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,559
know whatever it is no verify all those

702
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,960
packages and shove them in and um

703
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,880
yeah it's actually running on a real

704
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,440
raspberry pi but uh it needs a bit of

705
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,520
tlc but um

706
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,880
sure john d will be happy when that's

707
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,840
ready but

708
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,760
uh yes this is another

709
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,840
some cool stuff this is a device that a

710
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,880
guy sent me from a no comment place

711
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,120
and that's a phone that actually resets

712
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,760
the clock on the device every day

713
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,880
so that it can skip the demo period

714
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,120
uh sorry just re redo the demo every day

715
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,120
so it doesn't have to pay for the actual

716
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,799
software to be run on the

717
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,000
device

718
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,840
i'm pretty sure it's a phone attached to

719
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,720
it

720
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,480
yeah so you just said i yeah it works so

721
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,440
yeah uh agriculture is super important

722
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,200
and there's literally no one looking at

723
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,640
it so

724
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,400
it's probably yeah if you want to get

725
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,960
involved just hit me up there's plenty

726
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,200
of

727
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,840
plenty of stuff to do there's a lot of

728
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,199
work to be done and

729
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,760
literally no one's looking at it uh the

730
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,960
hardware is so easy to get on ebay and

731
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,600
like i said facebook things like that

732
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,960
and it's so easy to pull apart

733
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,080
unencrypted um you can get lots of them

734
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,520
and just keep destroying them because

735
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,440
they're they're dime a dozen and farmers

736
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,559
just like to throw them away because

737
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,240
obviously i don't need them anymore

738
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,480
um and literally i'm just one guy living

739
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,080
in thailand

740
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,039
buying tractor parts on ebay

741
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,960
and i was able to

742
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,279
get on to john deere's nerves

743
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,559
in quite a substantial way

744
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,720
yeah you can follow me on github

745
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,440
linkedin twitter etc

746
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,039
um

747
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,400
yeah some cool stuff i want to show you

748
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,880
as well is on top of that

749
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,919
nan flash reader is this other one that

750
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,559
recently i got from them it is really

751
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,720
hard to see i'll kind of like i'll kind

752
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,640
of like demo it actually but it's the

753
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,559
same size as the um

754
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,159
it's the same size as the nand flash

755
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,840
that goes in there

756
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,600
but it's actually i'll just hold up with

757
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,720
that it's actually a ribbon cable holder

758
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,799
like you know those clips that you

759
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:45,919
like

760
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,159
you know those snap on ribbon cables

761
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,400
yeah so you solder that onto the nand

762
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,000
flash spot

763
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,200
and then

764
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,679
connect a ribbon cable to

765
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,919
this one and then you can actually hot

766
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,840
swap the flash

767
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,480
non-stop you can just keep changing the

768
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,919
the flash so you don't have to keep

769
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,919
putting the hot air back onto it and

770
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,559
risk destroying the chip and this

771
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,320
yeah this needs a bit of work but it's

772
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,760
yeah mega cool

773
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,799
um

774
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,720
and yeah i've been attaching these to

775
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,919
everything because they're like you can

776
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,559
just keep editing the files on your pc

777
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:19,760
mounting it

778
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,960
shoving it back in here you don't have

779
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,440
to solder it back on and then you can

780
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,760
you can modify the file system

781
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,000
willy-nilly and play with it so capture

782
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
creds all that sort of stuff you know um

783
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,000
for the certificates that are encrypted

784
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,080
and things like that you can you know

785
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,320
pull them out um but yeah that's that's

786
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,320
um that's my presentation and

787
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,559
if anyone has any questions

788
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,640
or comments

789
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,159
yeah uh go for it

790
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,600
uh yeah the display i've actually been

791
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,679
playing with the display

792
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:54,640
uh

793
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,400
so i bought it for six thousand dollars

794
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,279
i think

795
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,640
um

796
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,120
it was donated to me sorry someone

797
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,039
someone paid for it but they didn't

798
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,480
didn't pay for it they said i have one

799
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,520
of these

800
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,799
um but yeah that one's also got a lbj

801
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,559
100 and taking that off the board it's

802
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,159
yeah that one's i'm having fun with that

803
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,000
one i'll be emulating that one

804
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,320
eventually um

805
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,679
but yeah that one's

806
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,080
that's i got four gateways and the

807
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,840
display and that's all there is really

808
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,200
in the tractor because after that you've

809
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,799
got the ecu

810
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,159
which is not

811
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,760
really

812
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,840
super technical and then

813
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,880
well that's the only thing in the

814
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,880
tractor with internet and then yeah

815
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,159
that's that's

816
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,799
that's all it is

817
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,880
um

818
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,240
yeah this so this hooks up to the

819
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,320
starfire there's the mtg

820
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,360
the gateway and then if you hook the

821
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,520
where is it satellite

822
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,480
where's the gps that gps goes up to the

823
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,159
starfire that goes on the top

824
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,000
so the starfire is just the actual

825
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,240
antenna for the

826
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,000
john deere tractor but yeah there is

827
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,159
there's a bit more in that receiver but

828
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,520
you can actually there's a couple of

829
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,240
hacks out there that um

830
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,520
have actually replaced that because it's

831
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,120
just can bus

832
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,360
um

833
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,720
maybe it doesn't go in oh no it comes in

834
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,399
here

835
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,480
yes one of these ports i'm pretty sure

836
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,000
it goes in there

837
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,679
um like i said i don't have a tractor

838
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,200
but i just um

839
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,440
yeah i just play with these ones so

840
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,360
but yeah it's um

841
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,360
i know a guy i know a guy who's actually

842
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,279
built a unit that will go in and um

843
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,480
what's it called when you sit on the

844
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,000
wire yeah it'll man in the middle of the

845
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,799
can bus and it'll tell the it'll tell

846
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,679
the uh unit that it's running a older

847
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,520
version of the

848
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,799
the satellite

849
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:43,919
and you don't actually have to pay for

850
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,520
the more expensive one

851
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,480
so yeah it's quite funny so yeah

852
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,399
but yeah it sits on the cam bus

853
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:51,360
go for it

854
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,360
uh this whoa this is like a kind of

855
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,279
two-part question so you know john deere

856
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,880
is notorious for

857
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,320
sucking with right to repair and

858
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,159
preventing people from actually

859
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,360
modifying

860
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,080
or fixing their their tractors and then

861
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,080
at least in the us the agriculture

862
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,440
industry is like you know you'll get

863
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,640
thrown in jail if you try to take

864
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,799
pictures of factories and

865
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,720
oprah got threatened by the you know

866
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,399
meat industry for saying she wasn't

867
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,559
going to eat meat um so the first

868
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:17,760
question is

869
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,399
it is how has john deere

870
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:21,840
reacted to you and have you gotten any

871
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,360
like stuff from that because i know

872
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,200
you've contacted them

873
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,640
and has like the agriculture industry

874
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,240
come down on you and then the second

875
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,159
question is the flip side of like people

876
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,760
who are doing right to repair or hacking

877
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,120
their tractors are they kind of

878
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,399
underground because they don't want to

879
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,399
get sued or is that like a growing

880
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:39,279
movement

881
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,039
well a lot of people don't realize that

882
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,600
the you're actually allowed to

883
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,480
modify some of your own equipment um

884
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,600
like i said i'm just a guy living in

885
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,120
thailand so i can do whatever i want

886
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,080
kind of

887
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,559
uh i'm pretty sure you guys too everyone

888
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,399
in the us has the ability to

889
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,640
you know you can jailbreak your iphones

890
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,919
and i'm not sure if it's classed as

891
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,120
consumer electronics or or vehicles but

892
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,480
i'm under the impression that you can

893
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,120
jail rate your own tractor um

894
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,600
john deere has had a headache with some

895
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,279
of the stuff that i've done before

896
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,559
last year we had a big um

897
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,320
like a teething problem they didn't have

898
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,919
a bug brownie and we kind of

899
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,320
eased into that together so

900
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,000
submitted a few bugs in the website and

901
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,080
um it was like a historical kind of

902
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,200
thing and it was the first person in the

903
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,720
bug bounty program

904
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,559
um first person in first person out

905
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:27,679
because i left because i don't like the

906
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,039
nda

907
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,000
um

908
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,840
prefer to have fun and just not have

909
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,600
necessarily have fun but like

910
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,279
you know they've got a bug bounty now so

911
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,399
yeah

912
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,399
um the other part of your question was

913
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,000
uh

914
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
what was it the bit about people repair

915
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,120
or like people that are hacking their

916
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,880
trackers are they doing it is it like

917
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,640
the mod chip scene back in the day where

918
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,000
like people are doing it kind of

919
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,919
surreptitiously or is it yeah are they

920
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,480
free to get into trouble there's um

921
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,240
yeah you're allowed to mod tractors and

922
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,039
i think

923
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,799
john deere and and its partners and

924
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,960
things they have the same sort of mods

925
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,039
that do like the the they've got like

926
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,799
bridges where you can put like the john

927
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,360
deere display in a case or a class

928
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,399
tractor

929
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:07,279
um

930
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,480
and there's actually bridges for

931
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,760
practically everything now so you can

932
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,200
put any

933
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,240
equipment

934
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,919
on any other

935
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,200
tractor so you can have like the same

936
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,880
display running on all the different

937
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,640
john deere tractors sorry all different

938
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,600
tractors

939
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,440
um

940
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,640
but yeah that's a super hack and

941
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,600
obviously that would never have been

942
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,919
around before is it is it time or is it

943
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,080
is it oh yeah um

944
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,120
yeah so

945
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,799
there's a lot of people modding them uh

946
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,880
there's a lot of mods out there i'm kind

947
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,120
of looking at some stuff so

948
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,440
yeah but i don't want to spoil it

949
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,840
okay cool uh we do have time for one

950
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,519
more question

951
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,519
okay

952
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,120
um

953
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,880
how did you get them to respond to your

954
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,399
quick key questions because those are

955
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,039
the details nobody would want to give so

956
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,799
what did you write or

957
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,640
they gave it to you because they already

958
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,960
knew yourself did you ask me what like

959
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,720
what why did i start this

960
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,960
no so you asked them about the key right

961
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,519
and they told you that yeah they gave

962
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,919
you the details that yeah it is common

963
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,440
on all the devices

964
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,440
it is a dev key generally companies

965
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,039
won't give that information so like what

966
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,960
did you write to them or or did they

967
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,559
know you and then yeah

968
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,240
i had that in a slide it's like a trick

969
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,159
where you like ask the company if

970
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:21,679
something's thing and then you get the

971
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:22,960
bug out of them you know what i mean

972
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,919
it's like

973
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,279
so i didn't know because i only had one

974
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,240
of them

975
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,600
and i was like

976
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,679
probably it's in every device so i sent

977
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,440
an email is this in every device and

978
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,279
they said yes so then i know now i don't

979
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,880
actually have to get two now

980
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,640
and yeah i do that with bug bounties too

981
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,320
you can send them a bug and then they'll

982
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,919
they'll actually send you back like uh

983
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,039
they'll send you back like something

984
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,559
like oh it's actually supposed to do

985
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:43,679
this and this and this and then you can

986
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,039
go and like negate that with something

987
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,480
else and you actually end up finding the

988
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,919
bug because of the person who's doing

989
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:49,200
the triage

990
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,880
but yeah it's quite it's a funny way of

991
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,840
doing it

992
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,440
it happens all the time actually

993
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,320
yeah

994
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,799
it's a neat trick but yeah just um

995
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,720
trying it's kind of like um

996
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,640
like impeaching the triager that makes

997
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,320
sense like put spinning it back on

998
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,000
themselves but yeah that's exactly

999
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,640
exactly i honestly like i can't check

1000
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,440
every

1001
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,720
device so

1002
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,240
i just asked them yeah literally just

1003
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,559
asked them and they said yes

1004
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,000
yeah

1005
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,919
which was cool

1006
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:16,960
all right

1007
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,240
thank you so much that was an amazing
