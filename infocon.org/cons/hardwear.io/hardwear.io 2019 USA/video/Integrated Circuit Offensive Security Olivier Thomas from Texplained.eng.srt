1
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:08,080
destroying things so I will either

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:10,540
behind my computers and so you don't see

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,879
me so much so I'm really happy to be

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:15,700
here I'm always going to add value

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,349
whether it's in Europe or now a year so

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:20,799
it's a good thing I'm here for the first

7
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:22,720
edition I'm really about that I learned

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,480
I was going to make a talk here one week

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,210
ago so I didn't tested this yet so let's

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,820
see how it goes so we were talking about

11
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:32,500
integrated security a lot during the

12
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,960
conference already with the two creases

13
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,500
that we're doing a good job of like

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,910
showing us the the the different step I

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,670
want to take a different approach here I

16
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:44,919
want to detect like to speak about like

17
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:49,379
offensive security so it will be maybe

18
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:53,289
less technical and it will concern the

19
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:55,718
the iron reverse engineering lab so the

20
00:00:53,289 --> 00:00:58,690
tools that I will use and what I'm going

21
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:00,460
to do will be similar in a way to what

22
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,530
Chris's was talking about this morning

23
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,750
and yesterday but at the same time it

24
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,430
will be a bit more advanced I would say

25
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:09,010
in the term of like all the things are

26
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:12,820
done all right so I will quickly

27
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:15,700
introduce myself I mean so I'm a little

28
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:17,770
Thomas F founder and CTO at explains so

29
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:21,700
we are specializing in reverse

30
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:24,789
engineering ships or all different types

31
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:27,549
of application and I'm also confirmed

32
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:30,460
there of IC inside which is a lab it in

33
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:33,220
fact it's a subsidiary of text/plain and

34
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:35,320
where we basically can do processor chip

35
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:38,439
the potato chip tech pictures of a shape

36
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:41,380
and then give that to to explain so we

37
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:44,398
can retrieve netlist and do whatever we

38
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:47,320
are asked to do with the wrister chip ok

39
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,689
so the idea behind this is like if you

40
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,089
can do reverse engineering you can do a

41
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:53,589
lot you know it's not only like what we

42
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,990
were saying this morning is like

43
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:58,840
attacking the chip to get like the

44
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:02,560
content out but in fact there's a lot of

45
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:07,090
things you can also do like supply chain

46
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:09,280
validation obsessions management IP

47
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,349
infringement research and stuff like

48
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,590
this I will speak about that also during

49
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:16,329
the talk because you will see on the

50
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:19,120
security side and the

51
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:23,200
side at least I see security I think is

52
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:26,860
like vest in some work to do to to get a

53
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,290
secure well anyway so this is the simile

54
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:31,440
of the talk here so if you have time to

55
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:35,320
read it it's fine I will not read it

56
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,600
personally and I just want my goal is to

57
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:42,130
try to start a discussion with you

58
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:45,640
basically about like what with reverse

59
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:49,440
engineering chips and what can we take

60
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:53,529
from this regarding security perspective

61
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:56,020
alright so I will start with going in

62
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:59,830
the process of reverse engineering your

63
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:03,160
chip so yes I will stuff with the

64
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:07,180
equipment because we so Chrissie's we

65
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:08,950
are using wet chemicals I'm also using

66
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,800
what chemicals for what I do

67
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:14,649
but when I what it comes to deep

68
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:17,440
processing your chip I also use plus

69
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:20,230
mattress so what chemicals what we were

70
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,060
listening to this morning was like if

71
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:24,609
you try to do processor chip and the

72
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,800
tech is a bit small it's not going to

73
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:29,230
work very well and the surface will be

74
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,570
an even if you have m serious it makes

75
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,640
it it will create holes and stuff like

76
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:35,230
this so it's not really cool plus

77
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,420
matching on the other side is something

78
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,910
which is pretty nice you know so if you

79
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,859
create two plasma so you excited gasp to

80
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:44,350
two separate elections and the other

81
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,360
parts of the atoms the idea is like

82
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:50,530
depending on the gas now you will be

83
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:53,560
able to remove oxide or metal okay so it

84
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,989
gives you or like a lot of precision

85
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,269
it's low enough that you can control and

86
00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:04,470
check your result and so on so that's

87
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:04,470
something that is used in the in in labs

88
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,100
but if you do only plus matching it's

89
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,930
not gonna work to to be honest because

90
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,910
it will be super nice for example to

91
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:15,910
remove the oxide layers and suddenly we

92
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:18,370
are lines and if you continue continue

93
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:20,978
plasma etching you will keep the the

94
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:23,050
profile of the line so as you go down

95
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:24,729
this profile will get super messy and

96
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,100
you will end up exposing several layers

97
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:28,770
or maybe not seeing what you are looking

98
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,180
for so the idea is really

99
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:32,219
be able to combine the different

100
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:36,240
techniques so wet chemicals dry

101
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:40,500
chemicals and also chemical mechanical

102
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,210
polishing cmp so for me it's not

103
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,220
chemical you know I'm not the chip in

104
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:46,638
door so I have no idea of the materials

105
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:49,680
that are used in the chip okay so I do

106
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,840
mechanical polishing on me all right so

107
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,300
this is the the machine we use for doing

108
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,219
this so it's it's a pretty sure okay so

109
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,830
you see for example here it's a disc

110
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:01,440
with diamond particles that are coated

111
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:04,289
on it and the cool thing with this

112
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,199
machine it has an optical microscope and

113
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:09,479
a five axis arm maybe it's even more

114
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,669
than five I don't even know but it's

115
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:14,550
it's super precise you can produce

116
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:17,008
produce chips that will be below 90

117
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,400
nanometer and keep going with it all

118
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:19,440
right

119
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,719
but the key will be to mix the

120
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,259
techniques alright so as you could see

121
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:30,539
already that what I will describe is

122
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:32,729
using already a lot of equipment so next

123
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:34,770
the G processing technique I was

124
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:37,860
thinking to show you pictures but then I

125
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:42,599
have so many NGS that it's difficult for

126
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:44,610
me to show you pictures so instead this

127
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:47,789
is the chip all right in what she wants

128
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,800
when you do your chip is basically

129
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:51,870
remove the passivation layer so the top

130
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,000
oxide layer to reach the lines so you

131
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,979
can take the pictures of the tracks and

132
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,110
then you want to basically remove the

133
00:05:55,979 --> 00:06:02,008
tracks and take pictures of the vias and

134
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:04,529
then remove the WS to get to the lines

135
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:08,039
and you continue like this until you

136
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:09,419
reach the transistors all right and now

137
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:11,610
you take the pictures of all the

138
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:13,650
transistors and that's your base

139
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:16,560
material so now you end up with a stack

140
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:19,109
of pictures I don't know to give you an

141
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,210
idea we have one out drive per customer

142
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:24,000
basically because when you do a project

143
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:25,830
it can be 200 gigs of picture you know

144
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,889
unprocessed and then you will process it

145
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:33,779
bla bla bla so you end up with a full a

146
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:36,710
drive Demitri particularly imagery so

147
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:41,669
this is a picture I can show it's a 1851

148
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:42,698
and micro controller nothing's secure I

149
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:44,930
can buy

150
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:48,110
just like to give you an example that's

151
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:50,590
a picture an optical picture and as we

152
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:53,509
saw this morning if your node is small

153
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:55,969
basically you are not able to use this

154
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:58,880
picture to trace signals or to find

155
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:01,850
things inside the chip so basically

156
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,889
that's not what we use as a source

157
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:05,690
material but it's already a good thing

158
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:08,150
because you can see the memories the

159
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:10,190
different memory blocks the CPU of the

160
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:12,049
analog circuitry and so on so it's good

161
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:15,830
for having another viewer and for

162
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:20,180
quickly function map I would say the the

163
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:22,609
IC you want to look at same IC but this

164
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:25,580
time we'll scan with the SVM all right

165
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:29,210
so I think the optical scan was maybe

166
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:32,120
200 pictures the SEM scan here is 10,000

167
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:34,190
pictures the resolution is a bit bigger

168
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,900
because so here all the interconnection

169
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:39,880
has been removed and basically what we

170
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:42,830
see here is the the doped silicon

171
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:46,250
alright so a resolution wise with the

172
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:47,750
SEM you can image whatever you want

173
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,970
because you have like a lot of

174
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:52,010
resolution I think like the modern SEMS

175
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:56,030
I have a resolution of something like

176
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:58,880
0.7 and a meter per pixel which is good

177
00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:05,599
even if the tech you want to to look at

178
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:08,270
this would be 5 nanometer all right then

179
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,490
this is where my process stops to be

180
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:13,520
able to be similar with Kristin or this

181
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:15,139
process because what I want to do is I

182
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,169
want to trace all the signals first

183
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:20,000
follow them because if I pressed all of

184
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:21,380
them you will see after if I need to

185
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,740
find something it's going to be a bit

186
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:26,930
faster so the idea is to convert the

187
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:28,010
pictures you have from the chip to a

188
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:32,810
netlist untouched

189
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:35,150
all right so I took an example here so I

190
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:37,400
think there's the chip manufacturer name

191
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:43,189
on this slide it's not a secure tip

192
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:45,890
again I was trying to be not I mean to

193
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,630
respect the secured chips so what you

194
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:49,790
see here is top layer of a device you

195
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,920
know it's a it's a tiny microcontroller

196
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:54,829
and here you have like the substrate

197
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,270
layer of the same device all right so

198
00:08:54,829 --> 00:09:00,439
basically you have knowing

199
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:02,689
connects anymore I'll need this room

200
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,640
straight so what we see is basically the

201
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:09,350
footprints of all the transistor that

202
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:12,260
are under under second all right and

203
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:15,530
what you see here is a tool in fact that

204
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:17,780
will be used to extract every features

205
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:21,260
from the paraffin pictures we will take

206
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:23,420
and to get like a HDL model of of the of

207
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:27,590
the chip so the actually model I want to

208
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:29,959
LA will be only the digital QR okay so I

209
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:32,600
give a true I give trainings and I say

210
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:35,420
always to to the to the attendees when

211
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,760
it comes to analog circuitry and if I

212
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:40,130
ask what is vision and if it's analog I

213
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,310
accept two answers which are basically

214
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:44,120
this is an arc circuitry or I don't care

215
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:46,699
okay

216
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,740
so if you if you want to attack your

217
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,120
chip basically the neural circuitry is

218
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:54,320
not something you want to look at

219
00:09:50,120 --> 00:10:00,050
because abusing the logic is what you

220
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:01,820
want to go for all right so if you take

221
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,859
a chip and you look at a cross-section

222
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,780
you will see it's made of layers all

223
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,930
right so you have to make a difference

224
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:11,480
between the top layers which are

225
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:15,140
interconnect lines and via okay a lot of

226
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:18,260
them this is passive I mean there's no

227
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:21,710
like it's not something actually was

228
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:27,920
smart to to any extent so just wiring

229
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:29,600
okay then wiring and therefore for all

230
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,849
of this layer what you want is basically

231
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,670
extract the vias okay so you see for

232
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:37,910
example here it's it's via one layer and

233
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:40,699
all the red dots is basically a polygon

234
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:42,709
which instead of Divya all right you

235
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:45,410
will do the same with lines lines are

236
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:47,420
not green when you retake a CM picture

237
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:49,520
so that's a pretty gun that represent

238
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:53,329
the line that was been that that has

239
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:56,030
been imaged and then you want to go to

240
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:58,340
the lower layer okay because in the low

241
00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:00,709
the lower layer what you will see is

242
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:02,990
basically the transistors so on this

243
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:05,510
picture you have the transistors

244
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,770
basically four of them and with metal

245
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,579
one which is the first layer of

246
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:11,939
interconnect you will be able to

247
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:14,248
this is I don't even know when or stand

248
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:19,019
out said alright I just reverse

249
00:11:14,249 --> 00:11:21,839
engineering this achieve the digital

250
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:23,429
logic is made of standard cells and so

251
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,429
basically you have some kind of a

252
00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:29,819
library the stand cell library with I

253
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:31,949
don't know between 100 and 1000

254
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:35,009
different of those cells and then it's

255
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:39,449
just like duplicated everywhere on the

256
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:42,749
chip and that's what you that's what you

257
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:44,429
can adjust reverse engineer okay so you

258
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:46,619
will end up with a catalog like this

259
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:48,509
which represents how many all the

260
00:11:46,619 --> 00:11:51,420
different standout server is inside this

261
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:54,629
design the cool thing is like now if I'm

262
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:57,839
looking hundred sheep from the same chip

263
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:59,970
vendor with the same tech note with the

264
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,069
I chains that we are using the same

265
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:04,860
store outside library so basically I can

266
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:08,040
reuse these results on different chips

267
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:11,249
okay so it's a one-shot operation to

268
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:14,040
reverse engineer standard cell for those

269
00:12:11,249 --> 00:12:15,989
to do training we know how to reverse

270
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:19,949
engineer so it's not too complicated or

271
00:12:15,989 --> 00:12:22,230
long process but once you have this now

272
00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:24,569
you can go inside your core and you can

273
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:27,119
find all the different instances of your

274
00:12:24,569 --> 00:12:29,878
standard sets all right and basically

275
00:12:27,119 --> 00:12:33,720
you just like made a map of what was

276
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:36,480
going on here alright once you have a

277
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:39,470
map of this and you have extracted the

278
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:43,499
stances but also all the interconnects

279
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:46,709
subtract and just for you build so I use

280
00:12:43,499 --> 00:12:49,949
VHDL should say very log in the USS

281
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:52,649
somebody told me so you can make a HDL

282
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:54,748
model of your secretary alright and

283
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:56,699
that's going to be a representation of

284
00:12:54,749 --> 00:12:58,889
all the interconnect between the

285
00:12:56,699 --> 00:13:02,579
different cells and this is inside the

286
00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:04,230
EGA tool you know it's it's not part of

287
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:06,779
the software and why it's important to

288
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:08,850
say this it's important because it means

289
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:11,249
that this you can just simulate it

290
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:13,049
alright so if you have something you

291
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:15,959
don't really understand you can go to an

292
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:18,209
AGA tool and simulate what you have just

293
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:21,149
extracted from the chip it's even better

294
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:21,779
because in fact you can simulate attacks

295
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:23,939
you know

296
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:25,589
change wires like I would do with the

297
00:13:23,939 --> 00:13:28,139
FIB but in the netlist

298
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:29,999
and see if the attack works to prevent

299
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:33,300
any cutting measure to say no stop

300
00:13:29,999 --> 00:13:38,220
doesn't work so I can really work on a

301
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:41,370
model all right of course it's not the

302
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:43,350
end the last step would be to yak ice

303
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:45,720
listen at least because this netlist is

304
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:48,720
flat okay so if you try to reach

305
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,850
something which is that flat it's gonna

306
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,029
be super painful and you will not

307
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:56,069
understand a single thing I would say so

308
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:59,220
if you are capable of like going from

309
00:13:56,069 --> 00:14:01,620
your VHDL model flats to something which

310
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,569
would be our case like this so now you

311
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,879
start to see the different bases and the

312
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:08,069
different structures inside your your

313
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:09,259
your device and basically we will learn

314
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:14,370
a lot okay

315
00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:16,379
and and yeah so that's about the the the

316
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:19,230
process I can show you in the software

317
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:23,430
it looks I have time I think to the to

318
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:27,990
do this just went to sleep all right

319
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:31,229
I have time so let me switch computers

320
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:32,970
that's so high tech I have to say that

321
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:36,029
the first reverse engineering software I

322
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:38,990
was writing was on Mac OS 6 and the the

323
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:41,519
the this tool that we will license

324
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:44,879
somewhere between now and the end of the

325
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:48,000
year is working on Windows which is a

326
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:50,129
bit frustrating for me but what can I

327
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,990
say you know so here you see so we have

328
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:53,670
a chip with different layers

329
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:56,519
okay so poly where you can see the

330
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:58,649
Pritikin the doped areas basically the

331
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:03,019
contacts and the Pritikin gates of the

332
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:06,860
transistors metal one so it's the first

333
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:10,379
interconnect layer tracks only via one

334
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:12,750
metal - yeah - and m3 and you can see

335
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:14,370
here that basically I extracted tracks

336
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:19,470
VR tracks yeah

337
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:22,050
tracks no tracks sorry we are for rails

338
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:24,240
all right and also this plant cells is

339
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:26,609
not this nuts in white here I don't know

340
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,910
why but here it is so maybe I did this

341
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:32,720
on the poly layer on me all right so

342
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:35,150
this is all the different layers of

343
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,590
course what I did was

344
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:41,660
what we did I mean I say I didn't do it

345
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:43,130
all by myself on this one but this is

346
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:47,300
basically all this turn out self that

347
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:49,040
have been used to design the the chip so

348
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:51,410
I put some names sometimes

349
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,329
basically if it's an inverter if it's a

350
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,339
Marx with a flip-flop which is very

351
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:57,020
interesting to have or latch or things

352
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:59,870
like this I put the correct names you

353
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:01,970
know just to have a visual reference but

354
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:03,710
if the style set is doing some funny

355
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:05,510
operation I call this come be like

356
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:07,760
combinatorial logic you know because

357
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:10,060
it's something that maybe I will not use

358
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:13,850
so much all right

359
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:16,219
of course after we can zoom in put a

360
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:22,130
motor inside and say how it works

361
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:25,700
basically yeah and then in fact after

362
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:28,580
you extract all the features so this is

363
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:30,680
the the so with that Mouse it's going to

364
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:32,540
be tricky but this is the digital logic

365
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:35,180
of the chip we'll just so before all

366
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:36,500
right so the this picture I don't know

367
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:40,310
if it's big or not

368
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:43,610
I suppose it's quite big and let's zoom

369
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:47,300
in just to get an idea of how this works

370
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:49,490
you know so the software is working on

371
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:52,099
the GPU that I have to deactivate to use

372
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:54,589
HDMI you know so it's uses now the Intel

373
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:57,710
integrated the GPU which looks to be

374
00:16:54,589 --> 00:17:01,370
really bad ok but anyway let's move in

375
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:05,030
you know you see it refreshes everything

376
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:07,400
at once and this is in fact our top

377
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:09,379
layers so only lines and you see so I

378
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,600
didn't touch the pictures let's out of

379
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:13,310
the SEM you know so it's white on a

380
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,230
black background which is like very

381
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:17,810
favorable if you want to make like

382
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:21,140
picture recognition feature recognition

383
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:23,300
and this is metal 3 of course and then

384
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:27,310
if you have liked the real here which

385
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:29,899
looks like stars that's pretty cool m2

386
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:32,120
so I really yours like your different

387
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:36,260
orientation you know and then you have

388
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:39,500
to yeah that goes to m1 and below m1 so

389
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:42,890
m1 and is is one of the layer that is is

390
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:45,429
is used to build the stances but if you

391
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:48,390
look at the poly layer you will see

392
00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:51,300
basically the the transistors in this

393
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:53,160
says and you can for some you don't if I

394
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:56,570
quickly what we are you know I see you

395
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:59,820
Cooper inverters year this is a nor gate

396
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:03,120
whatever okay one thing you are not

397
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:05,159
interested in and is the most things

398
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,020
here onto the big blocks here this is

399
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:10,530
capacitors and basically it's not

400
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:12,800
something that I would even want to look

401
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:15,330
at or extract or anything

402
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,430
alright so of course I was sing just

403
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:21,659
before from this you extract the

404
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:24,780
features so you extract the the contacts

405
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:27,860
on this layer okay so this the number

406
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:30,149
yeah this is the number of contact and

407
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:34,350
this layer so it's almost 1 million

408
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:36,390
contacts on on this layer almost 200,000

409
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:41,580
lines okay whoops

410
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:43,920
click twice alright and it's also 28,000

411
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,840
standard sets alright but I didn't took

412
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,610
them all it's it's still working

413
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,770
progress mister I think it's it's just

414
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:51,719
for demo purpose you know so sometimes

415
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,370
you are lazy to finish this kind of step

416
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:56,610
so there might be some cells missing

417
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:58,110
here and there but yeah this is just to

418
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:00,899
give you an idea of course if you zoom

419
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:03,629
out will you will soon realize that this

420
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,140
ping so that's only for a person start

421
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:09,090
cells

422
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:11,070
I bet that's already huge I mean maybe

423
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:15,320
displaying the lines wouldn't be a good

424
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:20,399
idea but just to give you an idea

425
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:24,179
alright so when you have this basically

426
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:27,150
you just validate this and if I press

427
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:30,630
this button here in something like 10 20

428
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:33,420
minutes we'll have the VHDL of the chip

429
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:37,230
and from this file now you can work

430
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:40,380
energy eg a tool sorry or you can use

431
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:42,420
whatever you want basically at the

432
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,250
pictures at scale you can also export

433
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,810
the layers and go to photoshop if you

434
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:48,810
want to trace the old-school way you

435
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:51,450
know but I would I would think it's not

436
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:53,490
the right way to do it and all right so

437
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:55,310
I switched to the other computer now

438
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:58,310
because it's fun

439
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:58,310
see

440
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:09,090
and now let's see what we can do from

441
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:12,000
that because it's good to have a VHDL

442
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:15,149
module of a chip but so far it's not

443
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,710
super interesting so the first thing is

444
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:19,470
how do you navigate the net lists

445
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:21,570
alright so we were seeing nice pictures

446
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:23,640
with signal traced and I used to do this

447
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:26,100
a lot you know and even like put paper

448
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:32,160
on the float draw the schematic you know

449
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:34,379
which is a bit funny but yeah I can show

450
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:37,530
you maybe like this I have here a small

451
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:40,050
tracing tool let's call it this way so

452
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:41,610
same chip again so here you can see if

453
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:43,409
the the then at least this is the

454
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:45,000
netlist you know so if you want to read

455
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,830
this and make sense of this you know

456
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,370
that's going to be tricky okay because

457
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:54,330
this is thousands of lines you see the

458
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:57,000
cursor is just about here and I am not

459
00:20:54,330 --> 00:21:00,330
lying 55,000 already you know so reading

460
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,240
a flat netlist is not something that you

461
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:08,520
want to do all right that's not a big

462
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:11,130
deal let's put this somewhere so I was

463
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:13,080
doing just an experiment this morning it

464
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:17,970
was tough to finish in time so I just

465
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:19,980
like traced and I put up a memory okay

466
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:22,530
and I want you to know where this output

467
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:25,320
was going because maybe if I can if I

468
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:27,240
can find or latch or register when I can

469
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,280
tamper with that I can start to play

470
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,620
like Chris was doing like you know code

471
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,040
extraction techniques or whatever you

472
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,800
want

473
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:37,830
so it's paste this here and so now I

474
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:40,889
will trace signals in the netlist like

475
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:43,320
this all right so this is basically the

476
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:44,940
output of the memory it goes to a stand

477
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,830
cell which is convenient i ah I don't

478
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:49,680
really care but I too arrives inside

479
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:52,550
this which is a flip-flop but also

480
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:54,990
multiplexer and now I'm getting excited

481
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:59,490
so first thing I want to know is like

482
00:21:54,990 --> 00:22:01,500
where are you ever flip-flop because I

483
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:03,480
know this is an 8-bit CPU okay so I

484
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:06,420
should have take three probes not only

485
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:09,180
one so I need to trace to find to trace

486
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:12,090
the the signals to find your flip-flop

487
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:13,590
so yeah I think it's the post commands

488
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:16,860
here

489
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:20,250
so if I could be pasted this year and I

490
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:22,620
do this now what I did is basically I

491
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:24,030
pull out the plug back you know and then

492
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:26,070
I said follow the clerk in the other

493
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:28,110
direction and bam I have eight flip-flop

494
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:30,450
which is becoming super interesting

495
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:33,840
because now I have full register and I

496
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:37,800
know we have this register is and I can

497
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:39,629
start to play with it alright so I

498
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:42,120
wanted to know more you know so I wanted

499
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:44,430
first to verify this so I want you to go

500
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:47,699
back to the memory basically so going

501
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:49,800
back to the memory is something that you

502
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,360
can also do pretty quickly and you see

503
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,430
that it's going to the same kind of

504
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:57,590
cells here so it's a good sign that you

505
00:22:53,430 --> 00:23:01,560
are going inside into the good direction

506
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:03,899
and then I wanted to see more so the

507
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:06,720
investigate part here is not interesting

508
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:08,850
and tracing back to first self the

509
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,650
memory it's not interesting I mean we

510
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:15,240
can do it just for the fun you know

511
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:17,430
thank you to do a few lines and in fact

512
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,710
you will see inverters so I don't have

513
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:21,810
them all as I was saying I didn't I

514
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:25,800
don't have all this cells and on this

515
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:28,770
chip who cares I mean you get the ID but

516
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:30,149
then I wanted to see something else you

517
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:32,129
know because when you have something

518
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:34,650
which is a flip-flop and at the same

519
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:37,230
time a multiplexer we are not far I

520
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:40,170
think when a scan chain you know a debug

521
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:42,180
chain and this is always interesting to

522
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:44,880
know where those things are so I just

523
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:47,820
like traced the other inputs basically

524
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,520
if that's the scan chain it means that I

525
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:53,790
have like the regular way of like giving

526
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:56,580
data to the CPU but if I activate the

527
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:59,220
over mode now this should be a shift

528
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:01,320
register you know and like all those

529
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:05,580
detecting and stuff like this I like

530
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:07,860
this so I did try on two cells to to

531
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:12,230
refer to trace basically you have an

532
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:16,139
input just to see what was going on and

533
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:18,300
guess what I have to do so I don't know

534
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:21,570
where I started this is getting miss

535
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:24,090
here but you see that input a year is

536
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:26,570
going to from one of the flip-flop to

537
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:28,459
the next one from one of our flip-flop

538
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:30,559
to the next one so you start to see the

539
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:32,330
chain basically and you know now the

540
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,908
order of the bits at the same time

541
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:37,480
because that's a chain so it gives the

542
00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:40,970
other for you and you can face this back

543
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:43,309
next step on this thing you know if I

544
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:45,230
want for example let's say we stand

545
00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:47,059
thing let's say it's not this chip

546
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:48,679
because this chip is like super simple

547
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:52,250
and everything but let's say this is a

548
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:54,470
SOC now and I find something like this I

549
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:58,130
would think JTAG you know and maybe the

550
00:24:54,470 --> 00:25:01,669
JTAG would be locked for some reason if

551
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:04,909
I see this now I know that I can trace

552
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:07,580
back the section signal okay in some

553
00:25:04,909 --> 00:25:10,340
kind of like zip search kind of approach

554
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:12,529
so I would say to the tracing tool full

555
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:15,230
of the signal back and I want to know

556
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:17,659
all the cells that are in between this

557
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:20,960
and flip-flops which will basically give

558
00:25:17,659 --> 00:25:23,990
me the control logic of the JTAG mm-hm

559
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,240
and now I can start to look for how do i

560
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:29,179
reactivate the JTAG you know maybe with

561
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:33,799
like a semi invasive attack or micro

562
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:38,210
probing or whatever you know so I mean

563
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:40,460
this is this is one possibility and so

564
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:43,820
then I wanted to do much more but i got

565
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:45,590
a half-chub time I ran out of time so I

566
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:47,570
think it's just like to give you the

567
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:49,639
idea of like how things can get analyzed

568
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:52,639
you know if you were to make the thing

569
00:25:49,639 --> 00:25:56,809
to this extent no remember this is only

570
00:25:52,639 --> 00:26:01,908
from pictures so alright that is

571
00:25:56,809 --> 00:26:05,120
navigation you do so of course when you

572
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:08,990
do like a situation assessment or if you

573
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:12,018
want to extract an end vm memory from a

574
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:14,299
chip you can use this this kind of like

575
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:17,000
tracing approach you know you will get

576
00:26:14,299 --> 00:26:20,899
no time to the first register when I say

577
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,330
no time it's one click and then if you

578
00:26:20,899 --> 00:26:25,309
if the register is like something like

579
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:27,470
this one we will be able to perform like

580
00:26:25,309 --> 00:26:30,230
a linear linear code extraction attack

581
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:33,110
and get the contents of the memory all

582
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:35,000
right so that's one thing I wanted to

583
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:38,758
also to show you another example when

584
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,649
you simulate things all right and Chris

585
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:42,809
Chris was speaking about Rome yesterday

586
00:26:40,649 --> 00:26:45,748
so I was like okay let's put let's take

587
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:48,089
a run where everything is like it's the

588
00:26:45,749 --> 00:26:49,909
worst condition ever you know so we are

589
00:26:48,089 --> 00:26:52,229
speaking about like small tech node is

590
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:54,419
crumbling for the word lines inside the

591
00:26:52,229 --> 00:26:57,119
rocks crumbling for the bit lines inside

592
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:59,579
the rom plus encryption inside the

593
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:02,428
digital core how do you get the thing

594
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:05,399
out you micro pog maybe yeah that's

595
00:27:02,429 --> 00:27:07,109
legit it could work but if you have the

596
00:27:05,399 --> 00:27:08,879
netlist of the chip you can do something

597
00:27:07,109 --> 00:27:10,678
different so I took this ROM you know

598
00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:13,168
and it's worst case scenario let's say

599
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:15,809
you see even like here if you look at

600
00:27:13,169 --> 00:27:18,059
the buffers and you try to come the D

601
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:21,329
output you will end up with numbers like

602
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:22,589
47 you know so a chip is 47 output for

603
00:27:21,329 --> 00:27:25,139
the ROM you know doesn't really make

604
00:27:22,589 --> 00:27:27,479
sense you know so it's just a tell that

605
00:27:25,139 --> 00:27:29,819
something is going to be really

606
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:31,589
complicated yeah so basically you can

607
00:27:29,819 --> 00:27:34,619
still use the tool because you have the

608
00:27:31,589 --> 00:27:36,869
noticed of the chip yeah first you can

609
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:38,698
extract the bits all right so now there

610
00:27:36,869 --> 00:27:42,569
is like some tools available on the web

611
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:45,629
or this high earth so it's good but

612
00:27:42,569 --> 00:27:49,408
let's say you extract the bits but now

613
00:27:45,629 --> 00:27:52,649
you can basically create a model of the

614
00:27:49,409 --> 00:27:54,359
complete wrong so here you have like all

615
00:27:52,649 --> 00:27:56,158
the addressing logic so basically the

616
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:58,649
addresses of the ROM arrives here in

617
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,989
this block this is the address decoder

618
00:27:58,649 --> 00:28:04,018
so you have like the schematic all of

619
00:28:00,989 --> 00:28:06,029
all of those things and the tracing tool

620
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:08,459
when it's doing the schematic it's also

621
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:10,409
doing the HDL of the block only what you

622
00:28:08,459 --> 00:28:13,499
traced you know which is useful if you

623
00:28:10,409 --> 00:28:15,629
want to er case for example the the

624
00:28:13,499 --> 00:28:17,639
thing or if you want to simulate and in

625
00:28:15,629 --> 00:28:20,099
this case I want to simulate so now

626
00:28:17,639 --> 00:28:22,019
inside this model face the scrambling

627
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:24,658
its inside I have no idea of how it

628
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:27,359
works but this is described in the in

629
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:30,089
the model so if I want to know I can I

630
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:33,569
can check but I don't want to know let's

631
00:28:30,089 --> 00:28:35,958
say it's okay the model is for me then I

632
00:28:33,569 --> 00:28:38,849
will go inside the digital digital logic

633
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:41,909
and I will use again some kind of like

634
00:28:38,849 --> 00:28:43,799
deep search thing inside to recover

635
00:28:41,909 --> 00:28:46,289
basically the decryption secretary

636
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:49,709
alright and if I have all of this now I

637
00:28:46,289 --> 00:28:52,169
can write the test bench or my PhD and

638
00:28:49,709 --> 00:28:54,330
model which would be give first

639
00:28:52,169 --> 00:28:56,909
address to the ROM and the Madeira will

640
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:59,158
tell me what's the decrypted value all

641
00:28:56,909 --> 00:29:01,590
right and I can loop half through all

642
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:04,320
the different addresses and get the ROM

643
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:06,480
content and clear I will not know what

644
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:10,279
was going on inside I will just get the

645
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:16,799
correct data no f5 is only pictures so

646
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:18,690
reverse engineering is cool all right it

647
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:21,359
doesn't stop here for me you know and

648
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:23,429
this is I mean like so far it's cool

649
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:29,100
it's technical we I think there will be

650
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:33,179
more politic and we can fight to me if

651
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:35,939
and if you get this kind of capabilities

652
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:37,799
and the bad guys can and some of our

653
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:40,080
guys can I mean like a lot of guys can

654
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:42,899
maybe no it's not so much but some at

655
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,678
least you can do things that are really

656
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:45,869
funny you know

657
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,999
SOPA bleaching for example try bleaching

658
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:50,549
if you do this from doing the outside of

659
00:29:47,999 --> 00:29:52,799
a chip what is going to happen is like

660
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:55,168
you will have no clue of what's going on

661
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:57,779
inside you know I did something there's

662
00:29:55,169 --> 00:29:59,789
a fault and maybe I can take advantage

663
00:29:57,779 --> 00:30:01,409
over it and that's it the effect is kind

664
00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:08,190
of global you know so it's hard to

665
00:30:01,409 --> 00:30:10,590
pinpoint the exact chain of events that

666
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:13,049
you created but now if you take a

667
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:15,449
reverse engineering software and you

668
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:16,980
followed the plot until it's created you

669
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:20,100
will see the Club distribution tree

670
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:21,960
alright and now I you can annotate two

671
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:24,629
parts of my chip and maybe this part

672
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,309
this part is something I want to change

673
00:30:24,629 --> 00:30:28,738
you know I don't want this to be updated

674
00:30:26,309 --> 00:30:31,080
by example arm you know I want to have

675
00:30:28,739 --> 00:30:34,320
control over my college I want to play

676
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:36,869
with the cloud post for example not

677
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:39,480
updating a register value and what I

678
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:41,580
will do is I will put a needle there or

679
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,279
maybe duo Biersch or some kind of like

680
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:47,340
crazy techniques to just inject an error

681
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:49,590
on a specific area but I will have

682
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:51,330
control this time to some extent this is

683
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:56,399
true also for accessibility

684
00:30:51,330 --> 00:31:00,149
some extent it's dependent on the type

685
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:01,408
of device and now it's it's maps but why

686
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:03,779
not I mean why not

687
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:05,580
so that's one example another example

688
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:08,039
would be

689
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:10,559
what we call the smart girl okay smart

690
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:13,830
gun is pretty cool so for example when

691
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:15,629
you do laser glitching you will take a

692
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,918
laser and basically you are fishing you

693
00:31:15,629 --> 00:31:19,019
don't know where to place the laser

694
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:21,269
alright so maybe you can just you know

695
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:22,739
test every point of the chip but make

696
00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:24,869
some map you know it's going to take

697
00:31:22,739 --> 00:31:27,450
yours if you want to be to have a test

698
00:31:24,869 --> 00:31:29,249
which would be correct but in fact here

699
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:31,950
it's a map so it's again the same chip

700
00:31:29,249 --> 00:31:34,409
in red you have the sequential logic

701
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:37,769
cells in blue you have two convenient

702
00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:40,259
area logic cells if the result is on

703
00:31:37,769 --> 00:31:41,820
combinatorial logic cell as soon as the

704
00:31:40,259 --> 00:31:43,950
laser will be off the effect will

705
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:46,710
disappear okay so you have knew your

706
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:49,619
chance of actually injecting your fault

707
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:51,989
is pretty low on both cells on the other

708
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:54,299
end on all of the red cells

709
00:31:51,989 --> 00:31:56,309
that's registers you know that's Piplup

710
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:58,408
so if I change our value now it will

711
00:31:56,309 --> 00:32:01,080
keep the value even if the laser itself

712
00:31:58,409 --> 00:32:03,480
so if I want to inject a pole I can

713
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:06,090
inject a fault here why I didn't show

714
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:09,149
you but all that is traced also is the

715
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:11,549
tracing software these maps so it's

716
00:32:09,149 --> 00:32:13,918
crossways reference with the pictures so

717
00:32:11,549 --> 00:32:15,749
basically if you find a register and you

718
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:17,820
want to play with only this register you

719
00:32:15,749 --> 00:32:20,399
can have a map and synchronize the thing

720
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:23,009
with with this so I was speaking about

721
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:25,320
the smart gun with with a laser but if

722
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:27,989
you do EMA attacks or photo emission

723
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:30,658
being able to map things on ownership

724
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:35,450
will will help you to make sense of your

725
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:37,769
data I would also advise to build custom

726
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:39,690
station you know like you do it yourself

727
00:32:37,769 --> 00:32:42,480
laser station like this one it's pretty

728
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:44,879
cheap and now if you can link this with

729
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,489
a map of up the cells it's gonna be

730
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:49,590
super effective especially if you are if

731
00:32:47,489 --> 00:32:52,019
you use techniques like oblique for

732
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:56,009
example to make the picture of the chip

733
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:59,820
so that's that's an example in anyway so

734
00:32:56,009 --> 00:33:04,139
let me check the time okay so far so

735
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:08,460
good so yeah this is where it gets it

736
00:33:04,139 --> 00:33:11,908
gets pretty bad I would say so I control

737
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:14,279
all of this different attacks reverse

738
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:16,230
engineering based attacks you know

739
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:18,800
intimate so it's kind of a new press you

740
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:22,570
know but if you look at the

741
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:25,430
the security evaluation schemes you know

742
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:27,919
you'll be shot you know so I'm familiar

743
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:30,200
up so I can speak about Common Criteria

744
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:32,060
much more than your certification scheme

745
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,800
but basically if you look at

746
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:37,129
certification scheme and communicate

747
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:41,930
area you want to reach party one if you

748
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:42,530
are your tip is rank 31 oil bull it's

749
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:45,200
secure

750
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:47,480
that's what the thing says so we all

751
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,520
it's also says that your chip will be

752
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:51,590
very varied against non invasive attacks

753
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:54,470
I mean versiv attack in fully invisible

754
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:57,260
tech but now there's something wrong

755
00:33:54,470 --> 00:34:00,290
here because as soon as you say I'm

756
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:02,629
gonna try an invasive attack you already

757
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:05,180
reach very one I just say it for you one

758
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:07,190
points so the chip is secure so the

759
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:09,170
attack is considered considered as a

760
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:11,090
residual stress all right

761
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:13,070
and when I say invasive attack I'm

762
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:15,290
already speaking about micro probably

763
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:18,200
I'm not speaking about like getting the

764
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:20,570
netlist out and being able to map data

765
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:22,810
and to use the reverse engineering data

766
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:27,140
to build something way more complicated

767
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:30,350
okay so basically most certification

768
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:33,049
schemes don't take this into account at

769
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:36,830
all okay even if it's written on it it's

770
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:38,960
it's it's not true so at the time when

771
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:42,020
you start to attack you already had 31

772
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,360
so the chip is secure you know too bad

773
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:48,230
and we're speaking about chip I'm not

774
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:50,000
speaking about like a CPU I'm speaking

775
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:51,320
about like for example secure elements

776
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,330
you know that you want to protect

777
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,760
something and there may be the situation

778
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:57,860
mint is 10 years in the field and after

779
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,290
one year somebody can just like do what

780
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:03,640
you want with it and the end of the game

781
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:07,460
you know but the chip was secure okay so

782
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:11,930
all right don't see too much

783
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:15,470
don't get angry it's a game on the other

784
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:17,540
side because on the other side and so

785
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:19,490
that's the list of some of the service

786
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:21,470
that we do at explain but you will see

787
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:24,319
that things except the Design Review

788
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:26,419
thing all the rest is based on the fact

789
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,910
that we can reverse engineer the the

790
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:31,190
chips to the point where we have an at

791
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:31,970
least and here you will see like

792
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:33,590
different

793
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:37,339
things and it's a it's not always

794
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:41,030
security you know and people need this

795
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:43,070
alright so what do we need have any risk

796
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:47,420
assessments if you are cheap in door and

797
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:50,570
you want to test your chip in black box

798
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:53,599
situation for example you can do risk

799
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:56,119
assessments who yams and integrators

800
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:58,460
wants risk assessment much more that the

801
00:35:56,119 --> 00:36:01,369
chip windows them said okay so this is

802
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:04,099
just as I said nothing they don't trust

803
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:08,060
in fact the data sheets for some reason

804
00:36:04,099 --> 00:36:10,070
and we want to make sure that what we

805
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:13,910
heard with the certification scheme is

806
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:15,470
is true or if he wants to also know

807
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:17,390
about like the invasive part of things

808
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:20,480
it's a it's something that's pretty

809
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:23,150
pretty interesting oh yeah miss an

810
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,130
integrator wants to benchmark the

811
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:27,530
different solutions we can put in place

812
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:31,220
you know so that's a second thing and

813
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:33,380
then I think the Pirates device so was

814
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:36,709
doing this with Chris in the PC industry

815
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:40,130
for some years it's a fun thing to do

816
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:41,930
but it can give you the opportunity to

817
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:43,490
learn about what the Pirates are doing

818
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:47,450
so maybe you are better at doing

819
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:49,339
consumer I said maybe but that's

820
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:52,879
something that people can want to try

821
00:36:49,339 --> 00:36:55,460
too so that's the security the regular

822
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,810
thing I would say but there is something

823
00:36:55,460 --> 00:37:01,700
more to it like 26 for example

824
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:04,220
what's with the iPhone you know how can

825
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:06,410
I access all of it you know it's getting

826
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:09,410
complicated at some point you know but

827
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:11,660
the people we wanted at a anyway so what

828
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:13,970
we will need to do is basically go to

829
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:15,920
the chips you know and try to understand

830
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:18,919
what's going on there you know so we can

831
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:21,020
build like super complex attacks to get

832
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,810
to the data you know because fighting

833
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:25,190
against terrorism or try pornography or

834
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:27,920
these kind of things is something that

835
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:31,960
matters I guess and if you need to do

836
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:35,109
this let's do it you know I can be fun

837
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:38,210
whenever thing is compatibility you know

838
00:37:35,109 --> 00:37:41,119
so Chris was speaking responding about

839
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:43,280
printer cartridges yeah you should see

840
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,140
how this is driving the word reverse

841
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,660
engineering mark

842
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:48,700
you know so you're nothing a bit those

843
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:51,040
labs who are just like producing the

844
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:54,490
solutions but they produce solution

845
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:56,920
because you can buy on eBay or sorry

846
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:59,740
Amazon will be I mean like wherever you

847
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:02,560
want like the the the cartridge you know

848
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:07,000
the frenzied cartridges and the the

849
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:10,360
market is huge like the cartridges alone

850
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,520
is like brilliant last market per year

851
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:15,940
you know that's than your every new year

852
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:19,450
so if you can act one of this printer

853
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:21,820
cartridge I can buy you if I be SEM and

854
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:23,859
all but you want you know because first

855
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:27,520
time is gonna be all right you know so

856
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:29,710
and it was driving in a way like the the

857
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:32,110
research in Isis security but it never

858
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:37,840
reached the public domain you know it's

859
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:40,540
a that's the cool thing in a way because

860
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:42,970
over the domains that had this kind of

861
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:44,920
demands you know like I listed here but

862
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:46,930
too much if for example yeah but if you

863
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:49,240
want to build something on a car you

864
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:51,220
know and in fact you cannot access

865
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:53,229
anything because like so only

866
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:54,870
proprietary systems and you have no

867
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:56,920
access to it in blah blah blah blah and

868
00:38:54,870 --> 00:39:02,470
reverse engineering can be something

869
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:04,240
that's cool focus looking for

870
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:06,640
counterfeits I'm not sure I need to go

871
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,990
to the net list for this but why not I

872
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:11,160
mean here you have like four different

873
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:14,529
generation of chips that are used in

874
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:15,850
lightning cables counterfeit but I just

875
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:18,580
wanted to show you something

876
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:21,040
yeah that's a huge microcontroller yeah

877
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:23,230
it got a bit smaller then it gets a bit

878
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:26,520
smaller it's different micro conscious

879
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:29,620
so it means that let's call them

880
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:32,170
counterfeiters they just like emulate

881
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:34,390
the system we took at the last one the

882
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:36,250
last one is a custom ASIC there is

883
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:39,220
enough money there that people can start

884
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:42,570
to manufacture their own chips you know

885
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:45,310
the why not and this is what you're

886
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:47,020
after and if you want to understand what

887
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:51,520
we did now I think you have to reverse

888
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:56,290
engineer the chips why not I mean okay

889
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:58,509
so then tribute to Joe your sticker

890
00:39:56,290 --> 00:40:00,850
other Etrian and back doors you know how

891
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:03,910
do you detect booth it's free yard you

892
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:05,410
know so the supply chain is something

893
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:06,910
that we want to very date though at

894
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:09,250
least you want to make sure that the

895
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:12,490
chip you you you you get out of the

896
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:14,740
factory and the one you design okay it's

897
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:16,720
a it's a tough tough question because

898
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:18,520
how do you do is like you do side

899
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,379
channel with stress pattern and you try

900
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:22,570
to get to the points yeah but now if

901
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:25,210
something is wrong with what what do you

902
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:28,570
learn from this okay so I think like I

903
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:32,080
personally think that and only if you

904
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:34,750
can get to a golden sample which is a

905
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:37,600
good question what's a golden sample in

906
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:41,830
that case you can just like tech chips

907
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:43,810
and DDR the chips I lying the pictures

908
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:45,970
and already optically you can look for

909
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:48,640
difference so optically it's not going

910
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:50,430
to be fun so take all the features out

911
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:54,250
of the chip and now compare the features

912
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:57,220
the cool thing now if you see some extra

913
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:59,590
circuitry or missing secretary you have

914
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:01,180
the VHDL module of the extra secretary

915
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:02,800
or the missing secretary so you can

916
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:04,509
characterize but you have in front of

917
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,090
you and understand what's going on

918
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:10,510
alright I think it's a it's a good way

919
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:12,700
of doing this but pathways and blah blah

920
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:14,770
I'd say it's so slow to put things in

921
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:19,270
place you know it's sometimes it's

922
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:22,600
annoying um anyway patent infringement

923
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:25,030
is another demand that we have regularly

924
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,770
like III think they stole our IP you

925
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:28,750
know they don't pay and we are using the

926
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:31,240
same thing okay but how do you know

927
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:33,070
where can you prove it now I can't you

928
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,839
know but now if I can take out the IP

929
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:36,940
from the netlist and say look that's

930
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:39,220
your IP in the competitive products as

931
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:43,480
some people will get super happy about

932
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:45,730
that so and it's I mean like it's

933
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:47,710
logical I mean if I'm building ships I

934
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:51,510
want to make sure that my things are not

935
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:51,510
stolen you know so I want to verify this

936
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:56,399
oops a sense

937
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:58,530
judgment yes since management I like

938
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,330
when I have a phone call from somebody

939
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:03,330
that says I have a chip to reverse

940
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:03,870
engineer it's one square centimeters now

941
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:06,480
I'm scared

942
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:09,270
because one square centimeter if the

943
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,880
tech is like 90 nanometer or 40

944
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:15,150
nanometer it's going to be like millions

945
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:17,340
of gates you know and I'm gonna happen

946
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:19,650
yeah it's not gonna be fun but then we

947
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:22,760
say no that's 10,000 standard cells and

948
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:26,130
you are like whoa it's a shock you know

949
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:29,820
so BIG's your face and the thing is like

950
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:30,510
the tech we are working on a maybe 2

951
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:33,360
micrometer

952
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:36,540
for the the gate so 2 micrometer and now

953
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:38,040
we are at 5 nanometer so it's a fact or

954
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:40,650
I don't know it's a it's a big

955
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:42,630
difference but anyway so we have a

956
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:45,900
system that can be really complex and

957
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:47,820
very cheap where nobody knows where the

958
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:51,540
chip is coming from the chip the chip

959
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:54,690
designer doesn't exist anymore about the

960
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:56,190
code inside nobody knows the only thing

961
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:58,020
we know is like this thing is

962
00:42:56,190 --> 00:43:00,030
discontinued and at some point we will

963
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:03,660
miss the chips you know so that's also a

964
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:05,730
good thing I mean that we can reverse

965
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:07,379
engineer the netlist so we can get the

966
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:10,470
functionality the other functionality

967
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:13,440
it's also a good thing that we can I can

968
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:16,350
get the code I think it's a legitimate

969
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,720
in this case in this case and that we

970
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:22,560
can maybe emulate the old sees the old

971
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:24,270
chip inside the FPGA and then and for

972
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:26,520
the customer instead of replacing the

973
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:28,350
compete board making a new design you

974
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,370
know for making sure that the thing is

975
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:31,500
working properly

976
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:34,080
maybe you just need to replace his sheep

977
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:36,090
buyer by a doctor board with the FPGA or

978
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:39,750
just an FPGA or on or something

979
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:45,180
that would be way easier to carry

980
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:46,830
basically that's all I want to say no

981
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:48,750
what I want to say I want to confident

982
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:51,420
besides I was saying I wanted to start

983
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:54,570
the discussion with you ok because I was

984
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:56,970
speaking on me about like a king chips

985
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:59,580
you know and the thing is like in

986
00:43:56,970 --> 00:44:01,200
conference it's pretty rare so Adria was

987
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:03,750
like mind-blowing for this like it at

988
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:06,020
least three ports for talks at least

989
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:08,360
about like integrated circuit security

990
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:11,850
pretty equal

991
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:14,160
but it's it's always offensive things

992
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:17,190
you know I'd like to hear more but the

993
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,839
defensive part of it yeah because I mean

994
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:21,330
so at explained we designed some

995
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:23,670
consumer when we see something that we

996
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:25,920
can do but most of the tank boosts

997
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:29,520
consumer here are kept secret by chip

998
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:33,270
vendors and they don't add security we

999
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,980
can speak about shield or s 1 / 4 + 15

1000
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:39,600
flashes and stuff like this it doesn't

1001
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:41,790
help kayfetz marketing so yeah would be

1002
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:44,870
really appear to speak with you after

1003
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:47,520
the talk and some kind of feedback about

1004
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:51,900
the different application and how you

1005
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:54,570
see address security going and and and

1006
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:58,160
yeah but it's so thank you for your

1007
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:58,160
interest if you have some
