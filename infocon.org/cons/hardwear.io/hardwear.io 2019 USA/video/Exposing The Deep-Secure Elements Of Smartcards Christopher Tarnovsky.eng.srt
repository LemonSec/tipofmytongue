1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:09,960
hello good morning everybody

2
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:11,250
so this is a small crowd compared to

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,950
what I'm used to but it's been a long

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,900
time since I spoke in public so uh I

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,029
came up and Rick wanted me to speak here

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,279
and I had a problem coming up with talk

7
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:22,289
titles so these talk titles are kind of

8
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:27,359
weird but he we made them up together

9
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:29,130
and talked to this title actually it

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,509
goes fits better for today because the

11
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,960
chip I'm about to talk about is a

12
00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:36,239
Samsung I see for the printers and this

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,530
chip this I see is worth millions a

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,419
month a month

15
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,949
these printer companies like apex and I

16
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,690
believe they're out of Korea they're

17
00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:44,930
making millions on the samsung printer

18
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,730
line on the laser the laser toners

19
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,600
aftermarket toners and Samsung's doing

20
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,000
whatever they can

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,890
HP's doing whatever they can they're all

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,019
incorporating smart card ICS today and

23
00:00:52,890 --> 00:01:00,300
to protect their toner or their ink even

24
00:00:55,019 --> 00:01:02,429
their ink a $10 st ink cartridge has a I

25
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,269
see inside that would cost you several

26
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:06,030
hundred thousand to get at

27
00:01:03,269 --> 00:01:09,750
reverse-engineered so with that let's

28
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:12,299
start so I don't I if those who know me

29
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,280
I don't do PowerPoint early so I want to

30
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,040
take you into my world which is

31
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:21,299
Photoshop I'm not at Oliver's level yet

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,770
with an automated tool so I just want to

33
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:24,329
give you for the next 45 minutes I'd

34
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,729
like an overview of weight basically

35
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:31,619
what's gone on in life let me zoom out

36
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:34,500
here actually hold on we'll go to this

37
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:37,439
in a second so this I see had a shield

38
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,780
to secure it was I believe four metal

39
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,770
layers this is not my laptop by the way

40
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:56,990
this is an trixx laptop and it's not

41
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:56,990
working okay it doesn't want to go

42
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:08,549
I'm touching it sorry everybody you know

43
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,009
one okay so if everybody can everybody

44
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:13,920
see this okay I can zoom it in Vega

45
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:15,660
larger if you need to so so this is this

46
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,329
was a for middle a for middle layer

47
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:20,519
device 130 nanometer shrink aluminum

48
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,810
process wasn't copper yet and normally

49
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:24,900
everything under 130 is gonna be a

50
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:27,390
copper process this is all SEM image

51
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:30,019
scanning electron microscope if you've

52
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:35,578
heard the word before you might have one

53
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:37,470
and so this chip had been this is this

54
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:39,299
is this is the result of several devices

55
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,280
so several devices were taken they were

56
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:43,110
polished down they were thrown into acid

57
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,090
fuming nitric or fuming sulfuric and

58
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,799
they were each one was polished to a

59
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,209
different level so the first one was

60
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,410
stripped the shield off strip off this

61
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:51,480
protective metal layer on the surface

62
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:55,560
all it is is straight lines going across

63
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,750
the chips and none of honestly it's a

64
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,670
waste of time it's it's an obstruction

65
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,829
but when you have a focused on being

66
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,569
workstation the shield does nothing I

67
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:07,980
broke every shield I've ever come across

68
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:10,078
in minutes so so basically right here we

69
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,418
have our top metal under the shield so

70
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:14,160
we polished to this level then we pump

71
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:16,319
then we take another chip we get to this

72
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,540
level we compare the two chips okay

73
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,608
which one looks nicer to us okay this

74
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,590
one looks nicer keep it now let's go one

75
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:23,970
layer lower so we're gonna polish it

76
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,560
down every layer we're gonna strip down

77
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,299
on these chips these chips are destroyed

78
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,400
you know they're they're throw they're

79
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:31,079
throwaways afterwards and so you've got

80
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,000
you've got we don't care about that

81
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:35,310
shield again that active shielding on

82
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,130
the surface you'll see some pictures of

83
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:40,799
it in a little bit so we've got our top

84
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:43,650
metal which is just wires then we've got

85
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,569
metal too which is more one more routing

86
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,609
more wires and then we have our logic

87
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:49,168
layer which wasn't green and red I

88
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:51,599
painted that that's my VDD and ground

89
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:53,489
rails just to for a quick we know which

90
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,660
when I'm looking at a gate you know and

91
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:55,950
I want to figure out what a gate does

92
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:58,620
I've got to look at metal one and poly

93
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:01,168
so the actual transistor lay out the

94
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:04,229
dopings for the wells for the different

95
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:06,150
you know p-type or n-type doping so this

96
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:07,720
is what got done to this chip then it

97
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,960
was thrown into a SEM

98
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:14,500
it was imaged and I believe 20,000 times

99
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:16,540
so zoomed in 20,000 you know optical

100
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:19,660
microscope can go up to about 1,500 and

101
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:22,000
this is 20,000 and SEM can go up to a

102
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,880
millions in zoom so even if your if this

103
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,630
is a 10 nanometer process you know it's

104
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,070
it's gonna be very hard to polish this

105
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,659
device is polished down using a

106
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:34,180
combination of techniques called

107
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,350
reactive ion plasma etching as well as

108
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,510
manual polishing

109
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,950
so the rioter does a good job but

110
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:41,560
sometimes you have little pockets in the

111
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:44,320
oxide if there's gaps where there's no

112
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,510
if there's a space like here like right

113
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,700
here you might get a gap you might see a

114
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:50,349
dip dip in the put in the end the result

115
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,060
so then you throw it on the polisher you

116
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:54,120
can clean this up and get the results

117
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:56,440
you see here

118
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,700
the whole time I'm talking if anybody

119
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,219
has a question to start your hand up

120
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,539
this is a very informal today just you

121
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:04,660
know I just want to take you into my

122
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:06,310
world and see what happens I'm the only

123
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,320
one doing this stuff I don't have a team

124
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:10,750
of people it's all me so I've got to do

125
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,760
this do the acid I've got to do the

126
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,440
polishing I've got to do the imaging the

127
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,060
stitching I've got to get them aligned

128
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,800
the layers aligned because every one of

129
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,260
these layers is perfectly aligned in the

130
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,270
in the Photoshop picture something that

131
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,469
Oliver knows for sure is not easy to do

132
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:31,000
all the time yes sir

133
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:34,450
I use an ultra Tec ultra pole I'm sorry

134
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:39,220
I don't know what's your I don't

135
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:41,080
understand no no no no no it's just a

136
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,090
disc it's a but they're about twelve

137
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,620
thirteen thousand dollars and it's just

138
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:48,250
a disc it's a heavy piece of equipment

139
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:50,169
that's it's about this big and that long

140
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:53,320
that high and it's got a disc on top

141
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:55,090
with yeah yeah with a felt pad you know

142
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,860
and I use my finger with the chip when

143
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,960
I'm when I'm done so it goes through a

144
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,750
Riots process first reactive ion plasma

145
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,060
here and then after that after we get

146
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:06,520
down you know we move dioxide next we

147
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,990
run a process to remove the metal then

148
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,240
then I'll look at it I'll throw a real

149
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:12,940
quick with my finger on the on the

150
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,610
polisher so I've got videos I had videos

151
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:17,380
before and people have heard this from

152
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,330
me before so I'm trying to get right

153
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,480
into the SEM picture itself and then not

154
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:28,640
focus on the techniques

155
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:31,490
so much so so so we've got this chip

156
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,080
it's 130 and 30 nanometers which I have

157
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,150
to say it's pretty small stuff has

158
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,450
gotten smaller like here's an here's an

159
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:45,109
before we get specifically into Samsung

160
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:50,360
it doesn't work this is a new Mac I'm on

161
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:52,370
a 2011 Mac Mac so thank goodness the

162
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,530
Photoshop is open so here this is a 19

163
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,810
animator ST Oliver it's lab back in

164
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:59,900
France helped me do this one actually if

165
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,910
you remember maybe this is an ST 23 this

166
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,039
is used also in a printer cartridge and

167
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:06,050
so these guys are hiding behind these

168
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,640
common off-the-shelf smart card ICS and

169
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,410
this is something I'll talk about at the

170
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,570
end of the talk today there they're not

171
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:13,160
they're putting millions they're trying

172
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:15,230
to save millions of money a year in

173
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,060
revenue you know but they're not doing

174
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:19,190
anything custom inside this I see if

175
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,420
they had customized this I see they

176
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:23,210
would have they would have thwarted a

177
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:24,770
lot of attackers possible so you can see

178
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:27,469
even at 90 nanometers the only thing

179
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:29,539
that's different to me is the way the

180
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:32,120
logic looks on poly and a little bit of

181
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:34,580
metal 1/2 but but it takes you 5 minutes

182
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,080
to get used to this so even as they

183
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,310
shrink smaller and smaller it just means

184
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:47,090
you're zoomed in more and more with your

185
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:48,650
semi so we've got this chip I'll zoom

186
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:51,859
out i cropped this picture this picture

187
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:54,200
7 gigabytes and the other picture I'm

188
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:56,380
going to open is 14 gigabytes which is

189
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:59,150
nothing I have a picture at my office

190
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:01,310
that's a hundred and 50 gigabytes and

191
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,929
it's a combination of semi I had a

192
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:05,270
Chinese lab do this for me brethren

193
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:07,310
rather than me build myself and the

194
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:09,260
Chinese lab gave me back 10 gig layers

195
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:12,950
each layer so each of those layers I

196
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:14,900
showed you guys was 10 10 gig per layer

197
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,400
and then once they got into photoshop

198
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,770
and photoshop 2 converts them into their

199
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,710
formats turned out to be 140 gigabyte

200
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:24,020
picture I just stick 512 gig of ram into

201
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:26,479
the computer with a dual xeon processor

202
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,729
so i've got this monster to do all this

203
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,410
work on but now I'm on intra-cloud

204
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:35,210
MacBook Pro

205
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:35,780
yeah so this chip this tip is a weird

206
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,760
chip

207
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,890
it's a comrade it's a secure column from

208
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,110
Samsung I don't have a data sheet on it

209
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:44,059
didn't really need one I was able to

210
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:46,520
find data sheets from other processors

211
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:48,199
that's that Samsung makes that gave me

212
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,449
enough insight into the instruction set

213
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:55,040
and so forth what to expect and on

214
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:57,500
boot-up it had a very small ROM can you

215
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:02,510
guys see this it's pretty dark can

216
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:06,490
everybody see the pictures is there some

217
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:08,990
way to to brighten this on the projector

218
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:11,420
okay so this is this is part of the ROM

219
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:16,100
I cropped it here so this was this was I

220
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:18,589
believe a 24 kilobyte killer word by 16

221
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:23,150
bit output so you had a you had a 16 bit

222
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:25,880
half here 16 bit half here you had a

223
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:27,290
EEPROM over here that's out of the out

224
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,960
of view as well because I cropped it for

225
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:33,020
size the EEPROM wasn't code executable

226
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:35,750
so this chip only runs code from its ROM

227
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:37,579
so the EEPROM is only holding secrets

228
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,170
and this is exactly what everybody's

229
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,360
after for the printer they want the

230
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:43,219
secrets this chips got a bunch of

231
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,770
symmetric cryptographic algorithms

232
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:47,720
inside as well as a symmetric crypto so

233
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:50,180
there's an asymmetric wrapper and that's

234
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,670
the one thing nobody can get except apex

235
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:54,199
in China and a company called static

236
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:56,689
control out of North Carolina I believe

237
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:59,000
they have the key how they got the key I

238
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:00,440
have no clue because it's it's locked up

239
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,180
pretty deep inside here and it's not in

240
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,740
the printer you can get one half of the

241
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,630
key out of the printer but the other key

242
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:08,600
is sitting inside this chip but um

243
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:12,740
there's they sued Samsung sued some

244
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:15,410
Koreans back in like 2011 claiming that

245
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:17,060
someone inside sold secrets so there

246
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:18,949
could who knows who knows what happened

247
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:24,319
but the key is known these guys are

248
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:26,750
making over a million a month so to

249
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,190
attack this chip there was nothing else

250
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:31,850
to special about the chip it had a bunch

251
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:32,300
of static Ram you can see here's a block

252
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:35,420
here

253
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:37,430
so here's Wow the I'm sorry this is it's

254
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:39,620
good it's m tomorrow's pictures are

255
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:41,839
gonna be all optical so you'll be able

256
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,990
to see beautiful colors and everything

257
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,550
it'll be very bright on the screen

258
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:47,170
this is the problem with the seven

259
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:49,449
sevens black and white you know shades

260
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:51,640
of gray so to speak so this did was a

261
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:53,440
static RAM here so the chip has a bunch

262
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:59,350
of RAM inside and it's got a small a

263
00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:01,000
small ROM so if you wanted to attack

264
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:02,410
this chip the first thing you're gonna

265
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,990
do you have to think to yourself well

266
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:07,000
how does it function well it powers up

267
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:08,920
this super secure chip powers up from

268
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,690
its ROM it's where every chip powers up

269
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,800
from they boot from their ROM or that

270
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,510
they don't have a ROM they'll boot from

271
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,359
their flash you know it depends on who

272
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:18,490
makes the device so the first thing that

273
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,080
I started to do was to trace the ROM so

274
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:23,709
you can see here like I've got each line

275
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:27,010
highlighted in a different color so you

276
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:30,189
know 0 2 0 to 15 now these are out order

277
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:32,589
the Samsung the ROM is heavily encrypted

278
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:34,959
not heavily encrypted but it goes

279
00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:36,880
through a process of some xor xnor s--

280
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,250
for some reason they decided to use x

281
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,370
nor gates not X or gates to decrypt

282
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:44,170
their fetch and they played around with

283
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:48,100
their crypto on where you've been last

284
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:50,860
to help decrypt the value so this ROM

285
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,540
has done kind of old-school you can see

286
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:54,850
it exits out here and then they

287
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,469
literally wire tied the left side of the

288
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:59,830
ROM to the right side of the ROM so they

289
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:01,779
didn't output 32 bits into a into logic

290
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:03,610
and then deduce okay which side do I

291
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:05,020
want the even or the odd side they

292
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:07,089
basically said we're gonna tie these

293
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:09,430
wires all together so the left you know

294
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:12,070
left side and the right side bit 15 are

295
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:13,089
physically together on a wire and then

296
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,830
we're going to control their output

297
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:17,140
enable lines so it's a different way of

298
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:18,580
doing business I wouldn't have done it

299
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:23,589
like that but but that's what they've

300
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:25,330
chosen to do so if you follow you follow

301
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:26,890
this and the first thing you can see

302
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:29,260
here is where I started to look I

303
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:30,760
started to look for fib access you know

304
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,260
when you're working with this chip it

305
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,850
has the shield on the surface which is

306
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:38,220
as I said straight lines going across

307
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:40,720
and I mean one second

308
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:43,050
okay I'm making sure all the layers are

309
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,050
on

310
00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:56,439
yes so you can see here there's a VDD

311
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:58,209
rail right here and there's a grounder

312
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,670
rail right here and this is the perfect

313
00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:02,410
access point to hit their bus but the

314
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:04,479
problem was I didn't know their ROM was

315
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:07,540
encrypted they have in the beginning so

316
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:14,319
I actually wasted time and put down 17

317
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:15,759
needles in this area hold on a second so

318
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:17,709
you can see all the different colors and

319
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:20,350
then all of a sudden and the reason I

320
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:21,878
thought I hit the jackpot so fast was

321
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:23,680
because within the ten minutes of

322
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:25,569
looking at this image not ten minutes

323
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,638
but within a very short amount of time I

324
00:13:25,569 --> 00:13:30,040
hit a bunch of flip-flops in this area

325
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:31,750
right here so when your data bus comes

326
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:45,129
into a flip-flop you're usually in the

327
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:47,889
right spot usually if we turn off so now

328
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:49,329
you can see I've got numbers so there's

329
00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:53,319
a flip-flop sitting right here with the

330
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:56,949
three so the flip-flop runs from about

331
00:13:53,319 --> 00:13:58,930
here to here they're very large elements

332
00:13:56,949 --> 00:14:00,729
in logic flip-flops are very easy to

333
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:02,109
spot you can spot them in seconds

334
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:04,509
they're not even there worth tracing out

335
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:06,250
you know you have a clock an input and

336
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:09,639
output and probably a setter a reset

337
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:11,949
line and that's that's it so it comes

338
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:14,139
into this block of logic and I thought

339
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:16,449
jackpot we hit it but I did notice the

340
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:18,220
data bus continued to continue to go

341
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:19,930
into the core deeper but I was thinking

342
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,610
well okay there's flip-flop group here

343
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,290
and then the data bus is gonna continue

344
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:26,709
for the operand you know you know jump

345
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:30,459
or a dad what ad how much this type of

346
00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:33,670
stuff so um so I put down I put down

347
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:35,559
needles I did the Edit and the data was

348
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,689
junk it was just junk because it wasn't

349
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:39,430
encrypted still so what this turned out

350
00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:40,990
to be when I you know then I'm looking

351
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:45,069
at this I'm gone something's wrong here

352
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:48,519
let me trace deeper I've allergies I'm

353
00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:51,128
sorry so I said let me trace deeper and

354
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:53,199
what I realized was that these

355
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:56,410
flip-flops are latching the cryptid

356
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:59,319
value of their ROM output and it feeds

357
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:01,250
into an X so a bunch of XOR gates but

358
00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:03,620
there's only one output for

359
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:05,600
whole entire area so there's there and

360
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,740
there's a 17 flip-flop which I don't

361
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,740
know why it's there it doesn't do

362
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,540
anything and does anybody think can

363
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:13,640
anybody think of what this did this is

364
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:15,530
it's actually pretty cool and I don't

365
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,510
know why it's here but and it doesn't do

366
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:19,459
anything because I've tampered with it

367
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:21,410
it's a parody generator that's all this

368
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,030
does it's a bunch AK source

369
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:25,400
they're running parody I believe it was

370
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:26,569
even parody doesn't I didn't care if it

371
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,040
was odd or even it doesn't make a

372
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:31,520
difference to me you know from my

373
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:33,620
purposes but um they put a not a tamper

374
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,660
they put a parity generator in an in

375
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:38,090
circuit on the cryptid fetch of the ROM

376
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,189
why I don't know it'd be described in

377
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:41,960
the datasheet probably tampering with

378
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:44,060
the one wire output of that generator

379
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:46,520
didn't do anything I didn't shut the

380
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:49,040
alarm down or it didn't trigger any type

381
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,540
of alarm to shut the chip down another

382
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,810
thing I might say about this chip for

383
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:58,099
being so secure I when I would cut the

384
00:15:53,810 --> 00:16:05,930
shield to to make a circle see if I can

385
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:08,000
open a picture here so you can see here

386
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:10,010
this is a this is what it looks like in

387
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,500
the in a focused on being workstation

388
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:15,140
machine so you can see here's for

389
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,820
reference so I even cut an arrow into

390
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:24,550
the glut into the oxide that's an arrow

391
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:28,339
so I lost my train of thought I'm sorry

392
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:30,050
yeah so I put I put down 17 17 needles

393
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:32,420
you can see here and there here's the

394
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:34,040
set of a flip-flop why do I want to mess

395
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,689
with the set because I can control the

396
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,640
output of every one of those flip-flops

397
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:39,560
with one needle so with one needle I can

398
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:42,110
control I can set that outputs to zero

399
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,910
or one which in most cases a zero works

400
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:45,860
perfect to walk through time the whole

401
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:48,050
goal here is to get the contents of the

402
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:50,120
ROM out and then look at how you can

403
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:52,370
manipulate the ROM code to get your

404
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:55,100
EEPROM contents out it's for example

405
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:56,480
this chip speaks secure channel so it's

406
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,640
a secure channel from the printer from

407
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,370
the moment it powers on so the printer

408
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,960
powers up sends in a challenge stuff

409
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:06,170
like this is happening they pass a key

410
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:07,579
encrypted and and that and nothing is in

411
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:09,410
the clear you can't see the serial

412
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:12,589
number of the of the toner nothing

413
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:13,579
nothing where 10 years ago you can see

414
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:14,198
the serial number of the toner in the

415
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:20,319
clear

416
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:23,620
was in the clear so you can see in the

417
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:25,898
FIB to get these circles I moved over to

418
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:28,299
some from a bond pad so many microns

419
00:17:25,898 --> 00:17:30,639
over so many microns down and then I

420
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:32,740
made windows right here so using a gas

421
00:17:30,639 --> 00:17:35,168
called xenon difluoride I was able to

422
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:36,610
basically remove the oxide because the

423
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:39,940
chip is made out of metal and oxide

424
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:42,760
basically and so right here and these

425
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:44,980
these are basically windows so I can see

426
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,529
through these like it looks like a jail

427
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:50,740
like like a jail or something which is

428
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:52,149
the active shielding which didn't work

429
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,580
by the way that was what I was gonna say

430
00:17:52,149 --> 00:17:56,289
I forgot I'm a little nervous yeah this

431
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:58,870
so the active shielding on this secure

432
00:17:56,289 --> 00:18:00,549
device didn't work the parity generator

433
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:02,649
on this secure device didn't even work

434
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:04,950
you know I don't I'm not sure what

435
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:07,719
they're up to but you know I don't know

436
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:09,700
so I could I could put I could make a

437
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,529
hole in the shield like I did like I did

438
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:13,510
for all of these circles so what these

439
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:15,580
circles are there's a hole through the

440
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:17,529
through that shield I removed so I

441
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:20,110
removed the wire physically removed the

442
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:22,929
shield line drill drilled down deeper

443
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:25,389
hit hit the wire I was after from that

444
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:28,210
from the photoshop picture and then

445
00:18:25,389 --> 00:18:31,570
filled that hole with a via of platinum

446
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:34,240
and I can use platinum or tungsten and

447
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:35,950
then I deposited a platinum circle as

448
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,889
you can see on like number 12 number 13

449
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:40,120
number 4 and then there were some weird

450
00:18:38,889 --> 00:18:43,090
things where the chip would sometimes

451
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:45,549
die so then I thought okay maybe there's

452
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:48,519
a random check in there in the ROM in

453
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:50,110
the contents of the ROM that says is the

454
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:52,149
shield working as the shield been

455
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:54,070
tampered with this is most likely what's

456
00:18:52,149 --> 00:18:56,260
what the manual tells the software

457
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:58,090
designer to do is basically you know

458
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,740
read a register and memory and the

459
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:01,658
register is going to tell you if or

460
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:03,850
stuff of stuff a value into a register

461
00:19:01,659 --> 00:19:05,889
and read it back from another register

462
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:08,230
and if you get your value back or

463
00:19:05,889 --> 00:19:12,428
whatever their little formula is the

464
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:14,110
shield is working but at no time that

465
00:19:12,429 --> 00:19:19,620
would the chip would just stop running

466
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:23,559
it wouldn't die yes shield made out of

467
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:24,840
aluminum single very thin wires of

468
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:27,389
aluminum

469
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:34,470
I believe on the surface of this chip

470
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:37,950
the the wire size was to 200 nanometers

471
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:39,840
I think 250 nanometers on top metal the

472
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:41,909
the wires on the surface are larger than

473
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,860
that as you get lower as you get the

474
00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:46,650
metal one the wires shrink down to I

475
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:50,090
believe like 180 nanometer wire size so

476
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:50,090
they get they get thinner smaller

477
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:59,730
exactly exactly yeah so like here the

478
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,530
chip has no clue I made this hole this

479
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:03,570
hole was done with xenon difluoride gas

480
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:06,480
so I stick a needle into the chamber of

481
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:08,250
the FIB and I and I draw a box and I

482
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,480
tell it mil and then and then all of a

483
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,370
sudden you'll see these wires right here

484
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,840
these white the white and this here

485
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:14,908
it'll light up white like you can see in

486
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,590
this picture this is almost exactly like

487
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:18,630
it looks like live on the machine I mean

488
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:21,510
it's a screenshot that I that I took off

489
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:23,549
my camera and so now I know then I can

490
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:27,600
then I keep milling but xenon difluoride

491
00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:30,658
gas per its it edges oxide seven times

492
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,549
faster than without the gas with just

493
00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:33,990
the beam if you just use the beam you're

494
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:35,850
pushing you're pushing the material

495
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:39,299
around you're not really removing it

496
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:42,719
cleanly when you run a gas the gas even

497
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:45,000
if you ran a tungsten or platinum gas at

498
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,620
the wrong beam current have not deposit

499
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,929
it would keep the hole clean too

500
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:52,080
so but uh ultimately you want to use the

501
00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:54,090
xef4 xenon the fluoride II and so the

502
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,240
xenon difluoride slows down the etching

503
00:20:54,090 --> 00:21:00,449
of metal but enhances the etching rate

504
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:01,830
of oxide of glass so here you can see in

505
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,750
these windows to find where I you know

506
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:06,480
am I in the right spot I'm looking for

507
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:08,400
specific wires that I that I'm familiar

508
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,289
with from the Photoshop picture so I

509
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,760
make these windows the chip has no clue

510
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:13,770
that I made these windows because of the

511
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,360
line the shield wires are still intact

512
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,799
right here they're perfectly fine

513
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:20,219
they're just exposed to the atmosphere

514
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:23,639
do you follow me so the chip has no clue

515
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:26,370
but again like I said I could I I could

516
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,659
make these circles do these deposits you

517
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:30,059
know I'm going down the middle to in

518
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:32,220
some cases so in some cases you know

519
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:34,230
there's metal for but that shield metal

520
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,640
three middle to middle one metal one is

521
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,780
the logic metal two and metal three

522
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,810
we're routing of them you know why

523
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:43,889
routing just like on a PCB you know you

524
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:45,570
know routing some cases these hole the

525
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:47,760
hole that I made before that circle got

526
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:51,629
placed was two layers down into the chip

527
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:54,690
and I only started fixing you can see

528
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:56,670
here I deposited platinum so I broke the

529
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:58,500
line I cut this line so now I took

530
00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:01,290
platinum and I went up over and down

531
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:04,230
again to fix it it's not quite as nice

532
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:06,060
as my Infineon attack was on the TPM the

533
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:07,650
Infineon attack I made bridging z' I'll

534
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:10,320
talk about this tomorrow for 5-10

535
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:12,420
minutes so this was but this was a quick

536
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,550
and dirty it did the job because their

537
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:16,950
active shield was like 32 different

538
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:20,100
circuits so they it was like 32

539
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:21,540
different wires doing something but as I

540
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,240
said tampering with the shield doesn't

541
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:25,889
the chip still ran talk no problem just

542
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,750
sometimes I'd see these random she have

543
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:30,930
to stop talking fix the shield and they

544
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:33,120
run again you can see here to here again

545
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:34,530
I dig I dug a window I'm looking for a

546
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,189
reference because I'm pretty far away

547
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:45,540
I'm this this is this is this is about

548
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:51,510
five hours on the on a fib yes I can't

549
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:54,540
hear you Adam oh you do what's called a

550
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:57,180
cleanup so you can see like like here

551
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:59,820
this black right here is where after I

552
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:01,650
did my deposits here I goofed up here I

553
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:03,750
so I goofed up when I was on the FIB for

554
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:05,310
number four so you can see I ended up

555
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:07,590
cutting two lines for number four for

556
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:10,080
some reason and on this particular chip

557
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:11,939
so you can see here I went down over and

558
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,429
up with the with the with the platinum

559
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:16,800
the deposition and then again I went up

560
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:19,050
over and down put the circle and then

561
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:26,610
you can notice here there's black let me

562
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:29,280
see if I can zoom this photo in yeah

563
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:31,290
well I have to isolate otherwise I

564
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,350
create shorts everything white here is

565
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:37,920
platinum spray oh look I even wrote

566
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:40,830
numbers into the chip this is this work

567
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:43,350
is 2016 so this has been sitting in my

568
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:46,620
hard drives for the last three years and

569
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:48,649
I'm still stuck in time but I wrote

570
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:50,899
numbers and

571
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:54,610
again this is all platinum everything's

572
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:58,190
platinum platinum is like 600 bucks for

573
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:59,840
5 grams 4 mil to 2 grams something like

574
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:02,330
that and it will last you for a few

575
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,709
years I've never replaced my platinum

576
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:05,750
gas I've only replaced my xenon

577
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:08,240
difluoride Sedona fluoride lasts me

578
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:10,460
about six months on the machine because

579
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:14,180
I use it all the time I know every day

580
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:16,390
almost and it's about 2,000 bucks to

581
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:22,280
replace it to exchange it much cheaper

582
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:25,070
so you can see here's the circle here's

583
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:26,899
that the Edit was right here and then

584
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:29,330
the circles connected into that hole

585
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:31,460
right there the shield's been cut over

586
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:33,530
here and cut over here and then it's

587
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:36,080
been jumpered here jumpered there and

588
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:38,389
then and then this is all isolation

589
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,490
right here this black this black so I

590
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:43,010
went because everything here this is all

591
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:45,470
platinum spray so this is all overspray

592
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:47,960
it's just like a spray can so so when

593
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:50,060
you're depositing a metal in a focus on

594
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:53,180
being Workstation you get a lot of over

595
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:54,800
overspray and the end result is what you

596
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:57,260
can see here you can see it's it gets

597
00:24:54,800 --> 00:25:00,050
dark because that's that's absorbing the

598
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:02,210
beam so the black is oxide and here's

599
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:03,919
where I've sputtered down platinum not

600
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:05,570
on purpose actually it was on purpose

601
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,250
yeah because there's way too much

602
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,510
there's way too much spray you can see I

603
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:10,250
was just rolling around on the machine

604
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:12,320
with the joystick just spraying with the

605
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:14,090
gas open so you leave the valve open on

606
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,919
the Platinum and you run a beam current

607
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:18,110
that's that's gonna drop it that's going

608
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,120
to deposit and and you just walk around

609
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:21,709
and it's just lights up on the screen

610
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,199
because otherwise you're in pitch black

611
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:25,910
you're in total darkness it's that you

612
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,110
know there's some challenges you know

613
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:30,650
with using it focused on being

614
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:35,149
workstation in this M so anyway that's a

615
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:36,500
successful 17 hole drop so that so then

616
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:40,010
I came across a bunch of stuff on this

617
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:41,450
chip I made schematics on paper this is

618
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:43,580
nothing like all of our stuff Oliver's

619
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:51,080
automated the whole process but you can

620
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:52,879
see here yeah yeah to put in yes to walk

621
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,939
it with a single needle so I walked at

622
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,800
17 times six hours to 16 times with two

623
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:59,660
needles down one needle messing with the

624
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,980
set line of the whole entire group of

625
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:03,590
flip-flops and

626
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:05,960
one needle on 0 then on one that on 2

627
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:08,480
then 3 and so forth the whole idea of

628
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,940
the said line was to make it think the

629
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,740
last instruction executed what is this

630
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,030
still being executed even though on the

631
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,040
front side of the flip-flop you're

632
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:17,840
getting you know 10 20 30 40 on the

633
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,790
output you're still getting you know add

634
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:23,360
10 add 20 or something something

635
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:24,770
something that doesn't branch so you can

636
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,540
see the first thing that comes out the

637
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:28,879
Ramat comes out right here and it goes

638
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:30,678
into what I call a buffer it's just a

639
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,350
buffer it's it's a it's a couple

640
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:35,240
inverters in series or in series to each

641
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:37,879
other and then it went to what I call

642
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,740
flip-flop group 1 and flip-flop group

643
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:43,100
one was the parity generator that I

644
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:44,600
talked about so this was the first place

645
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,639
I went to as I said because I saw the

646
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:49,280
flip-flops I got all excited got too

647
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,140
excited in fact and wasted like I said

648
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:54,290
it's a 5-hour edit to show you those 17

649
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:57,230
holes which is shorter than Infineon

650
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:59,299
Infineon was a six hour edit then the

651
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:01,910
bus keeps going down and it hits an X

652
00:26:59,299 --> 00:27:03,440
nor gate what I called X and one so this

653
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:05,390
is first stage of decryption of the

654
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,980
value which is when I realized okay now

655
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:08,270
I'm on to something and it gets even

656
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:11,570
better I hope I'm not running out of

657
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:14,750
time I barely started how much 10

658
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:17,870
minutes is all I have left okay okay

659
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:19,640
I don't know what I'm gonna do tomorrow

660
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,659
tomorrow that the picture is much better

661
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,520
the picture we're going to go over a

662
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:26,809
bunch of different chips Atmel st

663
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:27,860
Infineon a.m. micro I have like 10

664
00:27:26,809 --> 00:27:29,090
minutes on each one and they're all

665
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,530
optical they're not going to be some

666
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:32,480
like this they're a little bit larger

667
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:34,700
look at all principals at mills been

668
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,320
doing more more with their crypto than

669
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,570
any of these other chip companies which

670
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,330
is kind of strange because at Mel's not

671
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:43,210
really that good but they're smart cars

672
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:45,168
so the B input I didn't care what

673
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:46,580
because when you're tracing through the

674
00:27:45,169 --> 00:27:47,870
logic and I'll try to find these gates

675
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,250
in the in the photo shop for you guys

676
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:51,830
but when you're tracing through the

677
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:53,570
logic you see two inputs to an X nor XOR

678
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:55,040
and then you see one output the outputs

679
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:57,168
the largest line you're gonna see and

680
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,820
I'll show this on the pictures so it's

681
00:27:57,169 --> 00:28:01,070
real easy to just say okay the data came

682
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:02,659
in here who cares what B was let's keep

683
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:04,820
going because what are we looking for

684
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:07,760
we're looking for a flip-flop because

685
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:10,100
remember you can't you can't go into

686
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,870
this flip-flop and then the output keep

687
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,040
going with the bus because what you just

688
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:15,739
did was cut your frequency

689
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:17,180
half a flip-flop divides by two so if

690
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:20,840
you're at 20 megahertz that flip-flop

691
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:22,610
just knocked you down to ten so so this

692
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:25,399
is why I'm saying like you've run into a

693
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:29,540
flip-flop you know they got me with the

694
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:30,770
parity generator but you can tell if

695
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:32,510
it's right or wrong if you spend enough

696
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:35,360
time on it when you hit the flip flop

697
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:38,510
group so it goes into xor xnor one

698
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,760
output comes into another buffer and it

699
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:43,550
goes into another xnor second one and

700
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:46,730
then notice the B input was data but

701
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:48,740
data data bus bit one so the decrypted

702
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:51,410
d1 value or I believe it was decrypted

703
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:53,210
d1 value set into the B input and I

704
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:55,640
didn't really care I just did something

705
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:57,470
I came across so I documented it then

706
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,730
the output goes through an inverter to

707
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,660
another inverter the bus went to the

708
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:02,270
right two but it went to a bunch

709
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:03,740
and-or-invert logic if you guys have

710
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:05,900
heard this of anybody who took Oliver's

711
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:08,000
class probably heard these words and or

712
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:11,510
invert you make any gate out of and or

713
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,520
an invert so we didn't care about that

714
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:15,260
goes through two inverters which these

715
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,790
are basically buffers they're buffering

716
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:18,620
and then again it goes through an

717
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:21,379
inverter and then you can notice here

718
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:23,570
I'm basically saying put the FIB needle

719
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:24,980
down right here now this is something I

720
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:27,379
want to get into it this is really good

721
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:30,140
I like this notice I say there's

722
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:31,430
flip-flop one flip-flop two and notice

723
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:35,180
there's an inverter in front of

724
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:39,290
flip-flop to everybody see that and then

725
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:40,610
here's the direct output so you could

726
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:43,820
put your needle down here or here you

727
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:47,240
just have to note okay was I inverted or

728
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:57,500
was I direct on what it was so let's go

729
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:59,840
back to that photo shop this flip-flop

730
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,710
to get oh I got rid of it give me a

731
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:05,659
second I'm going to open a different

732
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:08,200
picture flip-flop to is very interesting

733
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:10,760
I'm calling an anti fly logic and

734
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:15,680
there's a reason there so they actually

735
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:16,970
they went through the kids opening they

736
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,830
went through the liberty to put down

737
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:21,140
instead of so this was their instruction

738
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:22,639
register area right here they went they

739
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:25,950
took the liberty of adding a second

740
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:28,200
flip-flop for all 16 bits so you had

741
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:31,710
every data bus bid had flip-flop 1 and

742
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:34,590
flip-flop to all flip-flop 2 did was

743
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:37,440
prevent me from tampering with flip-flop

744
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:39,240
1 if I tampered with flip-flop 1 they

745
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,320
ran on different flip-flop clocks so

746
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,820
everybody in here it probably

747
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,870
understands the flip-flop takes a clock

748
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:48,960
so all of the all of the data bus bits

749
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:51,360
with flip-flop 1 use the same common

750
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,220
clock and the same set line but

751
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,260
flip-flop two are in on a separate clock

752
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:57,360
it's the same clock but it wasn't

753
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:59,610
connected to the same same signal it was

754
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,260
coming from a different driver so the

755
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:03,439
reason for this flip-flop whose only

756
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:06,510
purpose in life was to prevent me from

757
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,430
tampering with flip-flop 1 but Samsung

758
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:10,350
made one big master mistake which a lot

759
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:11,670
of these RISC processors do if you ever

760
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:13,500
look at the instruction set of these

761
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:15,990
RISC processors I almost guarantee you

762
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:18,600
that one of the high bits represents

763
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:20,130
branching so if I take a needle and I'll

764
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:23,010
show you this tomorrow about at Mel's

765
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:24,660
AVR series have on their smart cards the

766
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:27,780
same thing goes for calm risks secure us

767
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:30,900
if you take a needle or if you take d15

768
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:33,030
and you cut it and you strap it to a 0

769
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:36,360
with with the fib or you put a needle

770
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:38,910
down on d15 and you prevent v15 from

771
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:41,250
toggling to a 1 the chip can't branch if

772
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:43,740
the chip can't branch that ship powers

773
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:46,200
up at 0 or wherever it powers up and it

774
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:47,490
and it goes - you know - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4

775
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,250
like you'd think it's that it's adding

776
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:52,830
so the instruction becomes something but

777
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:54,660
it's not a branch so the same thing came

778
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:57,389
and same thing happened with it with

779
00:31:54,660 --> 00:32:08,250
with the Samsung chip so let me find

780
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:10,530
that that area and trigger your it's

781
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:13,050
very difficult to use no I'm ok but it's

782
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:16,020
it's it's a it's definitely a different

783
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:17,550
MacBook than I'm used to so I

784
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:23,310
highlighted the flip-flops in different

785
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:29,010
colors ok there we go so you can see 14

786
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:34,379
14 and then you can see here if you can

787
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:37,320
read my writing it says D 8 D 8x or trap

788
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:39,220
everybody knows an exclusive are 1 in 0

789
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:44,620
is 1 0 + 1 is 1

790
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:48,760
0 0 0 & 1 & 1 is 0 so the output of that

791
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:51,340
schematic that I showed you so the

792
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:52,360
output these these two had to be

793
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:54,879
opposites

794
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:56,649
there are outputs they're registered

795
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,760
output you know I love the out you know

796
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:04,299
they're clocked output so if if 1 in one

797
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:05,020
if it's not 1 in 0 or 0 and 1 an alarm

798
00:33:04,299 --> 00:33:07,450
went off

799
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:10,539
so they actually let me see if I can

800
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:13,000
find it Samsung actually put in an alarm

801
00:33:10,539 --> 00:33:15,580
in case I tampered you can see right

802
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:21,669
here for NAND so this is a 4 input NAND

803
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:25,000
gate and anybody who's into logic you

804
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:26,980
can see I'll show you the poly you can

805
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,350
see what the NAND gate looks like you

806
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:31,360
can spot it very quick you see here's

807
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:32,678
your P channel here's your end channel

808
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,600
and of your Wells you can see the P

809
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:37,299
channel is always larger than the end

810
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:39,699
channel so it's very quick to see which

811
00:33:37,299 --> 00:33:44,139
rail is V is VDD in which rail is ground

812
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:46,570
on on a device on the semiconductor so

813
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:49,179
the reason for this for input NAND was

814
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:51,970
to handle all of these flip-flops X ORS

815
00:33:49,179 --> 00:33:53,080
so the X or the result of the XOR feeds

816
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:55,090
into these Nan's

817
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:57,220
and then these Nan's went to I believe

818
00:33:55,090 --> 00:34:00,340
an or gate a multiple input nor gate and

819
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:03,130
so I'm the truth table for a NAND is

820
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:05,470
like all ones or is a zero if anybody

821
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:07,179
goes to a zero it's a one output so if

822
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:08,980
this thing fired off a one that chip

823
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:12,639
shuts down well why didn't they erase

824
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:14,800
their secrets st microelectronic out of

825
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,570
france will erase their EEPROM their

826
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,040
double EEPROM or their flash on their

827
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:19,929
devices if I tampered with their shield

828
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:22,029
or if I do anything weird inside their

829
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:23,320
chip and Samsung just says that we're

830
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:24,849
gonna pause we're gonna freeze we're in

831
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:31,450
lockup we're not gonna do it execute

832
00:34:24,849 --> 00:34:34,060
anything so it's kind of strange so so

833
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:36,699
by cutting the 15 line here on this chip

834
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:39,639
I was able to get the ROM contents and

835
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:41,529
then the whole goal was now I need to

836
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:43,359
understand the ROM to get the double

837
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:45,399
EEPROM out and so the whole idea was

838
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:47,859
okay see what they're doing with their

839
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:50,290
math with their cryptography to send in

840
00:34:47,859 --> 00:34:52,100
a packet that requests the key that I'm

841
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:54,380
after be read from its

842
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,759
and then I sit with needles and I

843
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:57,770
capture the key as it comes out of the

844
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,600
chip so that'd be about three needles

845
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:01,880
it'd be one needle to do the to do the

846
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:08,420
glitch to basically so it's sitting on

847
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:12,530
the bus sitting one second so sitting on

848
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:15,620
the bus here I can tamper with them

849
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:17,990
momentarily momentarily meaning as

850
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:19,940
instruction code the branch comes down I

851
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:21,890
can turn it off if I'm on if I put a

852
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:24,290
needle on the 15 line you know so I put

853
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:27,290
a needle on D 15 not v-0 obviously and

854
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:29,630
and at a certain clock cycle in time you

855
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:31,970
know I Drive a zero into the chip where

856
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:33,770
I Drive a one and that's another problem

857
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:35,240
with these chips the only problems that

858
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:36,560
I run into in life is getting them

859
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,060
polished down as they get smaller

860
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,340
because some of these chips are not even

861
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:42,110
a half millimeter square they're so

862
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:47,840
they're so tiny now they're getting very

863
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:52,370
small but uh once it goes into the fib

864
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:54,680
it's done I'm at a time so the bottom

865
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:56,270
line was Samsung got rid of this chip

866
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,250
these chips are costing me about a

867
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:59,870
hundred and ten dollars each to get I

868
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:02,450
went through about fifteen of these

869
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:05,150
chips and then Samsung pulls up pulls a

870
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:07,460
quickie on me and they switched the chip

871
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:09,590
they're using so they went from from

872
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:12,140
this IC to an IC with the same exact

873
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:14,120
techniques inside just a different chip

874
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:15,890
different we know different layout but I

875
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:21,130
looked at I did a quick look at it and

876
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:29,330
just said I walked away from it yeah

877
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:36,980
does anybody have questions frustration

878
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:38,960
and money to do yeah it was affected but

879
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:41,180
the Chinese have the key they've got it

880
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,520
you know I think I was I was promised

881
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:45,529
250,000 a month if I crack the key on

882
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,000
this chip it's a lot of money I don't

883
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:49,640
know how many people make even 250 a

884
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,720
year it's a lot of money and this is

885
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,580
something I see these guys are flying

886
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,680
around in helicopters and private jets

887
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:56,509
private planes printer industry

888
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,040
something that's it's legit there's

889
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:59,930
nothing wrong you own the printer why do

890
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:02,180
you have to buy a toner from Samsung or

891
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:04,399
from the HP why can't you buy an

892
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:12,589
aftermarket toner I prefer the original

893
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:14,990
OEMs but you never know hi yeah would ya

894
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:20,420
if you have it still this was this was a

895
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:22,129
Samsung D 101 111 116 toner and today

896
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:25,250
the chips probably changed again

897
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:27,230
and to even like to get these to get

898
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:29,780
these images like this is these are very

899
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:31,880
nice send images and to get an image to

900
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:33,050
this quality forget the coloring the

901
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:41,330
coloring that's all me these were black

902
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:44,360
and white before yaddam because I'm

903
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:46,009
alone and I don't really know how I was

904
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:49,100
you know I would go buy these at Office

905
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:49,660
Depot yeah right and a GoFundMe or

906
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,890
something

907
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:53,420
yeah you can see here there's a full of

908
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:55,129
pops everywhere in this chip but you can

909
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:57,980
see this is the this is the overall of

910
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:59,960
the device on metal one and you can see

911
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:02,300
this is where I got to I got and I was

912
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:04,460
and you know why was I here I was here

913
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,600
because of here this was the rom output

914
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:07,400
there's something wrong with this

915
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:09,049
picture when I did the cropping you can

916
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,520
see the edge of it still but it turns

917
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:12,170
white for some reason right there

918
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:18,590
if something's with the Photoshop

919
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:26,390
version or something I don't talk to

920
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:29,870
them nothing I'm doing is wrong there's

921
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:31,850
nothing illegal about what I'm doing the

922
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:34,700
lawsuit that I was in with newscorp with

923
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:36,860
NDS for 10 years almost proved there's

924
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:38,899
nothing wrong with the verb with

925
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:40,850
reversing engineering reverse engineer

926
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,230
and I see it's what you do with the code

927
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:45,290
you get out of it for example if it's

928
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:46,700
pay TV satellite which some of people in

929
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:48,290
here are familiar with that's highly

930
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:50,899
illegal because you're stealing you know

931
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:52,490
the right HBO is signal basically which

932
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:56,330
it's a paid it's something you have to

933
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:58,580
pay for to put this mischief in the FIB

934
00:38:56,330 --> 00:39:00,799
the best thing to do is to throw it into

935
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:03,529
acid and then glue them down into an

936
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,730
8-pin ceramic dip these cost about 4

937
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:08,180
bucks apiece these little these little

938
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:10,460
sockets and then wire bond it you know

939
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,118
wire to here or wire there so this is

940
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:14,150
glued

941
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:16,819
glued down this with superglue you'll

942
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:18,769
see people in a fab using you know

943
00:39:16,819 --> 00:39:21,049
special glues and stuff but I want to be

944
00:39:18,769 --> 00:39:22,459
able to reuse the carrier later in on a

945
00:39:21,049 --> 00:39:25,038
different project I throw them into a

946
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:26,059
bin and like a glass jar and I can reuse

947
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:27,950
them later I just throw them into

948
00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:29,210
acetone for five ten minutes and then

949
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:31,399
the chip falls off again because it was

950
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:33,440
super glue but you can see here's two

951
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:36,589
chips prepped I just didn't attach the

952
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,969
wires yet I am so you know the next step

953
00:39:36,589 --> 00:39:40,219
would be to put them on under the wire

954
00:39:37,969 --> 00:39:42,319
Bhandar and physically under the

955
00:39:40,219 --> 00:39:45,650
microscope connect the wires up power

956
00:39:42,319 --> 00:39:47,269
ground clock and data line and then and

957
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:50,950
the chip will make sure the chip speaks

958
00:39:47,269 --> 00:39:50,950
and then into the Fitbit goes

959
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:11,259
thank you I guess I'm out of time yeah
