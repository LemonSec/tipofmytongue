1
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:20,660
and there we go ok so hello everybody

2
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:23,930
and so yeah I'm gonna talk about low

3
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,100
cost emission reverse engineering so I'm

4
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,470
going to start by talking a little bit

5
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,820
of background about the problem I'm

6
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:32,330
trying to solve and then I'll explain

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:35,690
what this kind of mouthful means so

8
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:37,430
basically the the issue is does this

9
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:40,040
ever happen to you you go to this talk

10
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,510
and you're like oh squiggles like what

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,640
what's what's all this stuff going on

12
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:45,110
here it's like I don't I don't have time

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,460
to like figure out what all these

14
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:49,310
transistors are and all these

15
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:54,200
connections so maybe do you have too

16
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:58,310
much time on your hands sir but what if

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:01:00,850
I told you that there was a way to see

18
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:03,560
the data that is you know instead of

19
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:06,500
figuring out all these transistors the

20
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,420
connections between them instead you

21
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,400
could actually see the data flowing and

22
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:13,250
then you know do some analysis to say if

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,049
I change this that this happens and then

24
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,030
you wouldn't have to figure out you know

25
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:18,740
how the transistors actually worked you

26
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,920
would just see them work and that's

27
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:25,369
gonna be with the focus of this talk is

28
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,929
so with that how might we do this so one

29
00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:30,469
does several ways you can do this and

30
00:01:26,929 --> 00:01:31,969
one of them is doing infrared emission

31
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:34,399
analysis and the way this basically

32
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:35,658
works is that in certain modes of a

33
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:38,179
transistor

34
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:40,429
they emit infrared light as the

35
00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:42,710
transistor is active and that's roughly

36
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:46,429
around 1100 nanometers depending on

37
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:48,259
specific transistor properties and so

38
00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:50,539
what we can do is if we take a camera

39
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:52,549
and a microscope set up that's specially

40
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:54,829
sensitive to this we actually can see

41
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:56,329
the emission so you know this is an

42
00:01:54,829 --> 00:02:00,079
example right here where I've taken a

43
00:01:56,329 --> 00:02:02,270
7805 voltage regulator and I've overlaid

44
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:05,329
some of the current flowing through it

45
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:06,709
as its switching and you know there's a

46
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:08,600
lot of existing I shouldn't say a lot

47
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:10,819
there's a small amount of existing work

48
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,799
in this area for example this paper

49
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:15,170
right here security the IC backside

50
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,000
there's a related paper that's quite

51
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:19,160
fascinating where they did some emission

52
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,260
analysis and actually broke AES

53
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,950
encryption algorithms by basically

54
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:26,629
photographing the the s boxes as they

55
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,750
operated and so I thought this was

56
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:28,920
pretty cool

57
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,560
but it seems like it's kind of an

58
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,750
underutilized field so I wanted to learn

59
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,069
a little bit more about that and I'll

60
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,379
explain a little bit later what kind of

61
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:41,190
my high-level goals were to kind of add

62
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:42,659
to this field so with that how would you

63
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,950
do this professionally because a lot of

64
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:45,810
these sort of reverse engineering

65
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,849
techniques are based on these

66
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,340
professional failure analysis labs and

67
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:52,260
this is an example of what one of these

68
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,170
professional machines from Hammond

69
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,819
mat-su looks like and basically what

70
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,819
there is in this particular machine I

71
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:01,798
believe or at least in the line is most

72
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:03,629
camera sensors are made of silicon like

73
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:05,700
almost universally when you hear

74
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:07,920
semiconductors you associate that with

75
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,988
silicon but instead of silicon they're

76
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,828
using a fairly exotic semiconductor

77
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:16,290
called mean gas that is indium gallium

78
00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:17,940
arsenide and because they want to get

79
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,500
super sensitive measurements you know

80
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,299
because it's not a light a lot of light

81
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,609
that's emitted what they'll actually do

82
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:25,890
is they'll liquid nitrogen cool it to

83
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:28,859
get that get the the noise from the

84
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:30,029
thermal down really really low so and

85
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:31,590
then you have to put it in this big

86
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,480
cabinet which we'll talk a little bit

87
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:36,000
about later so you know it's a pretty

88
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:39,418
involved set up but there's also a few

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,430
other alternative options so namely you

90
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:44,669
can get these sensors called back

91
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,590
illuminated CMOS sensors which you might

92
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:49,139
see in a DSLR I think these days or

93
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:51,299
something like that which are fairly

94
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:53,639
sensitive and we'll even talk about back

95
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:55,010
fitting a little bit later and the other

96
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:58,859
option is you get these things called

97
00:03:55,010 --> 00:04:01,948
cooled ccd z' and it's not quite liquid

98
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:04,500
nitrogen cooling but it also lowers the

99
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:05,730
noise that you get you know as you as

100
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,829
you try to use these sensors you know

101
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:10,560
and so instead of getting you know maybe

102
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:13,769
pixel values of 1 3 7 9 you know you'll

103
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,079
just get 2 2 2 2 2 2 and so that helps

104
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:17,699
you to get better data so how would you

105
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,010
actually go about doing this in practice

106
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:23,460
so there's I found that basically the

107
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:27,150
easiest options were to get this is from

108
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:29,039
tooth tech it's a it's a back

109
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:31,549
illuminated a CMOS sensor and ten

110
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:33,659
different microscopes the one small

111
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:36,060
modification I had to do though was I

112
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,430
had to remove this infrared light filter

113
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,090
so usually infrared light is considered

114
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,889
kind of a pull

115
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:43,169
lucien that that kind of destroys your

116
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:44,820
data but in this case i that was

117
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:46,590
actually what i was going for so i had

118
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,540
to remove that that was pretty easy just

119
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:50,940
to pop this cover off in and take out

120
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:53,010
the filter there the other option are

121
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,770
there are a number of these astronomy

122
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:57,270
cooled ccd s on the market so i was able

123
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,530
to find these the only problem is if you

124
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,750
look over here this is kind of a

125
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:02,969
telescope mount and it wasn't really

126
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:05,639
well suited for microscopes so i 3d

127
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:08,100
printed an adapter and was able to put

128
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,900
that on my microscope however this

129
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:13,530
camera is a little bit older than this

130
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:15,870
one and so it's USB 2 versus USB 3 the

131
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:17,789
software was a little bit harder to use

132
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,530
so just for practical reasons such as

133
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,750
frame rate and easier to use software

134
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:23,789
for the majority of the talk i used this

135
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,500
camera although i may i believe that

136
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,110
from a pure sensor perspective this is

137
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:31,470
actually a nicer camera and I may use it

138
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:34,169
heavier as I do more work so the

139
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,460
question is these cameras though we're

140
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:38,310
not really designed for what I'm doing

141
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:40,859
most cameras are designed for for no

142
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,539
visible wavelengths which you know let's

143
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,120
let's say roughly is in the 400

144
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:47,010
nanometer to I don't know some somewhere

145
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,680
around here and you can see you know we

146
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:52,770
got efficiency up to forty percent there

147
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,139
and how the emissions if you remember I

148
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:57,900
said I'm looking for our closer to 1100

149
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:59,610
now that is so far out of what this was

150
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,849
designed for they don't even show it on

151
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:05,789
their chart so the efficiency is a bit

152
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:07,889
low but it turns out to be enough that

153
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:11,310
it's usable so and we'll come back to

154
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:12,270
that a little bit so does this work and

155
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,740
that was the first question I'd ask

156
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,840
because I was a little bit scared when I

157
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,460
saw those graphs and I was like a you

158
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,310
know not not necessarily gonna work well

159
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:23,400
so I got a few different infrared LEDs

160
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:25,500
namely one that's roughly around a 1060

161
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:28,200
nanometer and another one that's roughly

162
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,789
around 1200 nanometer and pointed that

163
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,080
at the different cameras and what you're

164
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:34,110
actually seeing is in a normal

165
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:37,620
microscope image you are using maybe

166
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:39,240
like a halogen lamp or LED you know

167
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,760
luminaires and the shining light on the

168
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,440
sample and taking an image in this case

169
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,210
I've actually put current through the

170
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,640
LED and you're actually looking at the

171
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:50,219
LED itself lighting itself up for the

172
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,960
image so this is the 10 60 nanometer one

173
00:06:50,219 --> 00:06:54,479
here and this is the 1200 nanometer

174
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,888
here and I was pretty happy the results

175
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,719
it didn't take a lot of current to get a

176
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:59,759
microscope image a pretty reasonable

177
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:03,449
capture settings so I think that that

178
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,610
that put down a lot of risk on the

179
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:07,110
project with a pretty easy test and this

180
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:09,330
also allowed me to do a lot of

181
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:11,250
microscope testing there were some

182
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:14,008
concerns over you know is this is this

183
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,870
beam splitter you know going to filter

184
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:17,099
out infrared light do two coatings or

185
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,960
something like that because these

186
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:21,419
microscopes were really not designed to

187
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,340
operate this far out of the visible

188
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:25,530
spectrum and I'll talk a little bit more

189
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:29,359
about that later

190
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:31,500
so yeah I guess actually maybe now so

191
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,330
next thing I want to do was there's a

192
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,830
lot of issues with ambient room lighting

193
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:37,500
because because the light levels I'm

194
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:39,180
looking for are so small I have to get

195
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,680
rid of all of this that you would

196
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,930
normally have in the room and make sure

197
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,030
it doesn't shine on the microscope so

198
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:47,880
the first thing is here is like an

199
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:49,049
infrared cut filter so this is the thing

200
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,300
I mentioned earlier that would normally

201
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:54,180
take out the light the infrared light

202
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:56,340
from your microscope path but instead

203
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,039
what I actually want is an infrared pass

204
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:01,440
filter that is remove all of the visible

205
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:04,620
light that the camera would see and and

206
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,419
just show the the infrared light and I

207
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,849
installed that into a filter that I was

208
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:10,680
able to easily slide into microscope the

209
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:13,680
second is that the professional systems

210
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,440
use a hood kind of like this to filter

211
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,270
out the ambient lighting in the room

212
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,590
this is kind of big heavy and and I

213
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:21,479
didn't really want to deal with

214
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:23,039
something like that so instead I

215
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:26,310
basically did it was just through a box

216
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,380
on top of the microscope and it turned

217
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:31,500
out that if I did this which didn't

218
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:33,689
allow any direct rays to hit the sample

219
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:36,229
and I made sure there that I'd the

220
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:38,729
blinds closed and I didn't have any

221
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:41,219
halogen or incandescent bulbs on in the

222
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:43,110
room just LED lighting that was

223
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:45,600
generally enough to get pretty good

224
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:48,240
images and if I if I worked at nighttime

225
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,329
and I made sure all of the LED lighting

226
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,459
was off in the room I got pretty results

227
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:56,339
I was pretty happy and so you know maybe

228
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:57,989
this isn't ideal for a high-end lab but

229
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:59,640
at least for a proof-of-concept kind of

230
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:02,060
demonstrating a lower-cost way to do

231
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,650
this I was pretty happy with the results

232
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,609
so then I did a little bit more a

233
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:08,790
microscope

234
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:10,470
so one open question for example is you

235
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,810
get these different microscope

236
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,850
objectives rated for either infrared or

237
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:16,949
visible light and I want to understand

238
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,510
you know what what was the advantage of

239
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:20,430
selecting one of these over the other

240
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:23,730
especially since these were relatively

241
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:25,979
expensive and I should say new because

242
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,870
the way that I caught these was I found

243
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,480
ones that were dented or scratched on

244
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,800
eBay and I said good enough and you know

245
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,480
most professional people probably

246
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,279
wouldn't want that either because it

247
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,680
looks ugly but it turns out in most

248
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,170
optical systems you know scratch is not

249
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,699
as bad as you might think it is so so

250
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:44,040
this actually has a giant scratch on it

251
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:46,230
but for my purposes it didn't seem to

252
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,399
affect the results too much I could not

253
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:49,640
tell you the difference in optical

254
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:53,430
clarity between these but in any case

255
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:56,279
what I found was that generally speaking

256
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:58,589
this one worked twice as good as this

257
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:01,709
one that is the images were about twice

258
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:03,690
as bright there may also be some other

259
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:05,729
sort of chromatic Corrections year round

260
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:07,500
different wavelengths but for my

261
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,540
purposes that wasn't that important

262
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,160
either so I think you could get away

263
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:14,670
with something like this if you really

264
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,339
had to for some early tests but if you

265
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:19,469
have this you definitely should use it

266
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:21,449
there's also a few other optics in the

267
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,880
microscope that I'm able to kind of

268
00:10:21,449 --> 00:10:25,560
slide in and out and so for taking the

269
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,660
really sensitive measurements I would

270
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,339
slide those out to just get the absolute

271
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:33,269
most amount of light through the

272
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:34,980
microscope as possible ok so the next

273
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:36,810
thing is can we can we do this on a real

274
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,820
chip now so kind of theorized that this

275
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:40,229
is this might be a working set up so

276
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,420
what I did was I said okay one of the

277
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:45,720
easiest things I could do is we've got

278
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:47,819
this ESD diode on this chip and what I

279
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,880
did was I drove some current through

280
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:53,399
this ESD diode very carefully and I

281
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,500
observed that yes my microscope was able

282
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:57,209
to see this is not this is not like a

283
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,949
visible light like you wouldn't see this

284
00:10:57,209 --> 00:11:00,689
but I was actually able to see the

285
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:02,640
current flowing through this ESD diode

286
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:05,220
and now I'm verifying that you know this

287
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,319
setup does at least work to some degree

288
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:10,290
but the current levels here are fairly

289
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:13,290
large and the next question was you know

290
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:14,760
would this work on a on the actual logic

291
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:18,650
level you know instead of kind of a

292
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:21,710
power level signal so

293
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:24,350
so to get maybe a better signal I had to

294
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:25,160
do a few more optimizations and we're

295
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,320
gonna we're gonna see these

296
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,719
optimizations a lot so I want to spend a

297
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,940
brief moment to kind of explain why they

298
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,800
were done and and how they work so the

299
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,920
first thing I'm doing is called called

300
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:39,469
dark frame subtraction and in an ideal

301
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,599
sort of production scenario what I might

302
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:44,210
do is do something like Pearson

303
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,340
correlation but for kind of ease of

304
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:49,220
access what I did instead was I said

305
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:51,050
okay try to certain state of a chip that

306
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,420
we're interested in so this one over

307
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:55,010
here for example what I had done is

308
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:57,319
there was some transistor current

309
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:59,510
flowing through and I said make this the

310
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,760
new zero state for the image sensor you

311
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:04,760
know subtract out what you currently see

312
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,630
and because I didn't do it perfectly you

313
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,580
know because there's a little bit of

314
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:09,980
noise we can still see that there's some

315
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:11,990
kind of bright areas here but before I

316
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,430
did that dark frame to trap subtraction

317
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:15,680
it might have looked something more like

318
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:18,560
this but then what I did was I said okay

319
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,050
here's our zero state and then turn on

320
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,849
this transistor here and now we see if

321
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:24,319
this has increased in brightness so we

322
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:26,300
say okay there's a positive correlation

323
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,670
there and then I switched to a different

324
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,810
state where we saw a few other bright

325
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:32,000
areas here so that's a positive

326
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:34,369
correlation but also note that there's

327
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,380
now these dark areas and what those dark

328
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:39,080
areas mean is that I've gone below what

329
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,910
I'd consider the the noise floor due to

330
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,950
my relative measurement so these should

331
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:45,709
be interpreted as negative correlation

332
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:47,630
so once again bright area a positive

333
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:50,780
correlation dark area negative

334
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:53,990
correlation and the the second thing is

335
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:56,480
that we do histogram Equalization what

336
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:58,340
that basically means is you know I don't

337
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,840
know what the human eye can see but you

338
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:02,650
know let's let's say for argument's sake

339
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:05,930
it's something like an 8-bit color space

340
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:08,630
but these cameras are 12 or maybe even

341
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:10,550
16 bits so as we want to take a really

342
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:13,610
sensitive measurement you're not going

343
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:17,380
to be able to see a 1 value change on a

344
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:20,990
16 bit sensor but what I can do is I can

345
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:22,520
multiply this pixel values and if you do

346
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:24,230
that you know you might go from

347
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,630
something like this image over here

348
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:28,460
which in this case is fairly clear but

349
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:30,590
after multiplying it you see things like

350
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:32,030
this transistor here is a lot clearer

351
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:34,010
than it was in this image

352
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:36,860
and especially as we start going really

353
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:39,650
really sensitive those enhancements will

354
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:41,090
become really important so I'm not going

355
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,260
to talk too much more about this but

356
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:44,030
just know that these sort of

357
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:45,500
enhancements are being done through a

358
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:49,100
lot of the images to varying degrees

359
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:51,170
throughout the presentation okay so

360
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,520
let's let's look at a real trip now so

361
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:55,510
what I'm going to do is say we've got

362
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:58,579
some sort of basic logic chip here and

363
00:13:55,510 --> 00:14:01,160
we don't need to know how the

364
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,210
transistors exactly work but we do need

365
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,310
to know kind of a little bit of a

366
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:06,620
schematic level sort of idea of how

367
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:09,319
these chips might work so let's say that

368
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:13,910
this is a bipolar logic that we can tell

369
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:15,500
through some SOI guess and we're going

370
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:17,660
to kind of assume that there are some

371
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:20,470
standard ways that at a schematic level

372
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:22,310
people might design these chips and

373
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:24,680
other than that you know we're not

374
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:26,329
really going to do a lot of you know

375
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,329
logic reversal scenario it's just gonna

376
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:31,460
be based on correlation analysis you

377
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:34,460
know what sort of input stimulus do we

378
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:37,550
do we put in and how do we observe the

379
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:39,320
transistor switching okay so the first

380
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:42,109
thing you might say is let's let's just

381
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,910
get this narrow this down a little bit

382
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:45,320
so if we had looked and squinted a

383
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:47,150
little bit at that dye we would see that

384
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,950
it was basically four of the same

385
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:50,600
circuit repeated so we're just going to

386
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:52,700
focus on one corner of that and just

387
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,560
assume that this would apply to the rest

388
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,390
of the chip as well and then maybe based

389
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,609
on the circuit board this was from or

390
00:14:56,390 --> 00:15:00,860
some other assumptions we can roughly

391
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:02,900
know that it has a few input pins and

392
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:05,120
one output pin and we're gonna represent

393
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:08,810
that as this black box over here so we

394
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,760
have two inputs and one output and some

395
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:12,290
power pairs and then what we're gonna

396
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,180
try to do is figure out what's in

397
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:16,339
between here by doing this sort of

398
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:19,130
emission analysis instead of looking at

399
00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:20,780
the gate level and so the first thing is

400
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:24,680
let's take a look at the output stage

401
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:28,100
and so we provide some stimulus and a

402
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:30,319
lot of this sort of TTL bipolar logic

403
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:33,410
you have an output stage that looks

404
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,330
something like this so you've got two

405
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:38,900
complimentary transistors they call this

406
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:40,880
a totem-pole arrangement and you you may

407
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,650
either have one of this on or this one

408
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,310
on depending on the logic state you want

409
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,990
to represent

410
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:47,660
so for example if you want to have a

411
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:49,910
zero on the output you'll activate q4

412
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:52,339
which will basically drive the output to

413
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:55,249
zero and essentially if you want a one

414
00:15:52,339 --> 00:15:57,470
out there you'll instead activate q3 and

415
00:15:55,249 --> 00:15:59,569
q4 will be off so now if we take

416
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:02,059
photographs of that so what I did was I

417
00:15:59,569 --> 00:16:04,309
started from Z meaning high impedance I

418
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:06,410
started with nothing connected on the

419
00:16:04,309 --> 00:16:07,879
output and I said okay let's take a

420
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:10,040
reference of what how is the chip

421
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:12,939
operating in this state based on the

422
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,949
infrared emissions and then I said okay

423
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:17,389
now add additional resistance and what

424
00:16:15,949 --> 00:16:19,758
that's going to do is that's going to

425
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:21,980
increase the current consumption on the

426
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:25,399
output drivers of the chip and if we do

427
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:27,949
that we see these two little no blobs do

428
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:30,019
illuminate here and similarly if we had

429
00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:31,490
kind of a low output state and we do the

430
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:33,829
same thing where we increase the current

431
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:36,050
and do correlation we see this little

432
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:38,269
blob right here now if we look back to

433
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:40,399
kind of this kind of standard sort of

434
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:42,949
totem pole arrangement we see two

435
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,290
semiconductor devices here Q 3 and d 4

436
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:49,339
which we might guess are these guys over

437
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:52,099
here and one thing for Q 4 for the the

438
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:55,250
low outlet state we see one large sort

439
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:57,079
of correlation there so we can make a

440
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:59,449
pretty good guess that this these are

441
00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:02,989
roughly correspond to the components we

442
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:04,970
see over here ok so so that was like a

443
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:07,490
first order check now now let's start

444
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:10,100
looking at the inputs a little bit it's

445
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:13,640
very common on these chips to have ESD

446
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:15,948
diodes and so what I did was I said okay

447
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:19,610
let's assume that there's an ESD diode

448
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:23,240
on each one of these inputs and let's

449
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:24,859
try to I'm sorry let's do the transistor

450
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:28,339
first actually so we've got the

451
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:30,080
transistor and we're going to do is put

452
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:32,299
a little bit of current into each input

453
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,129
and do a similar test so we had it not

454
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:35,899
connected before and then we're gonna

455
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:37,580
kind of drive the output low because

456
00:17:35,899 --> 00:17:40,668
this is kind of a standard arrangement

457
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:43,250
we see on these and what we saw was that

458
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:45,830
roughly the same area got some current

459
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:47,899
on the chip so you know maybe the base

460
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:50,260
of the transistor and then we saw that

461
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:52,939
there was the same sort of negative

462
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:55,429
correlation as we activated that

463
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:57,110
transistor so this is important because

464
00:17:55,429 --> 00:17:58,730
it means that these two

465
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:00,709
might be tied together to the same

466
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:03,169
transistor because they had roughly the

467
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:04,610
same effect so let's just think about

468
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:06,259
that for a second and just kind of

469
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:08,570
assume that those are are tied together

470
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:11,149
at some level and then the second bit

471
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:13,610
which I alluded to earlier was those

472
00:18:11,149 --> 00:18:16,219
input diodes so we drive a small

473
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:17,988
negative current through those and if we

474
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,639
do that to each diode we can actually

475
00:18:17,989 --> 00:18:21,980
figure out where those are on the chip

476
00:18:19,639 --> 00:18:24,320
and so that's basically this area right

477
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:27,590
here and this area right here we've kind

478
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:30,590
of identified now as our ESD diodes once

479
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:32,980
again just by observation not by looking

480
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:35,359
at how the logic might actually work

481
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:37,009
okay so now now let's actually start

482
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:39,949
cycling through some of the logic states

483
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:42,470
and see how things change so if we take

484
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:44,720
these two inputs and drive them low and

485
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:47,059
we see kind of a high output we get this

486
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,070
and then if we if we start permuting

487
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:51,168
through the different inputs we get

488
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:53,480
these states now the very interesting

489
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:57,320
thing though is if we put both inputs

490
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:59,960
high we see a drastic change and how the

491
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:02,989
how the circuit operates so this is

492
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,669
rather interesting and we see we can

493
00:19:02,989 --> 00:19:06,320
also take a look based on our earlier

494
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:10,009
observations about you know what this

495
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:14,029
high-low state was so if we court if we

496
00:19:10,009 --> 00:19:16,850
put that into a table we see that okay

497
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:19,549
if input 1 and input 2 are low low we

498
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:22,668
get output high and if we tabulate this

499
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:24,980
we see we get this table here and we got

500
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:26,539
this black box here so from kind of your

501
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,909
your logic classes you might have taken

502
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:30,889
or something what is this a truth table

503
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:36,200
for does anyone know what what gate this

504
00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:38,508
is what's that NAND gate perfect so this

505
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:41,210
is a two input NAND gate and so now if

506
00:19:38,509 --> 00:19:43,700
we if we cheat a little bit and we look

507
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:45,080
up what the datasheet might have for

508
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,940
something like this

509
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:50,149
this is what we get and I've kind of

510
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:52,429
annotated the transistors over here over

511
00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:53,928
here and one of the things that I think

512
00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:56,419
is really nice about this sort of

513
00:19:53,929 --> 00:19:58,879
analysis is notice that we never really

514
00:19:56,419 --> 00:20:01,340
talked about q2 you know that was kind

515
00:19:58,879 --> 00:20:04,248
of an internal state in this and it just

516
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:06,049
was kind of an implementation detail but

517
00:20:04,249 --> 00:20:07,999
because all we want to do is correlate

518
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:09,139
the input and the output and never

519
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:12,410
really came up

520
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:13,610
analysis at least to a major degree and

521
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,990
so I think that's a lot of things that's

522
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:17,629
very interesting so you know if you had

523
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:19,550
buffers for example in burgers

524
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:21,140
you know those just kind of fallout from

525
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:23,840
this sort of analysis and you don't even

526
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,790
have to worry about them too much so

527
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,370
it's anyways so yeah so this is a very

528
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:30,560
basic chip so so the next question was

529
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:35,060
could we scale this up to something a

530
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:36,740
little bit more complicated and so what

531
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:39,440
if we took something like a 4-bit

532
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:42,070
counter so this is also worth mentioning

533
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,780
that if you're a 7400 series

534
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:48,290
knowledgeable the very first one I did

535
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:50,330
was a pure 7400 series which is fairly

536
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:52,159
high current and then I've now moved to

537
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:54,110
the LS series which is also a little bit

538
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,670
lower current and this was also to

539
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:57,590
demonstrate you know the effects of

540
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:59,960
starting to move down and the current

541
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,879
flowing through these transistors and so

542
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:05,690
the question is could we actually see

543
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:09,140
this counting visually and so I'm going

544
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:13,610
to try to pull up a video now so if I

545
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:16,520
can I'll tab over and so we see the chip

546
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:19,250
here the layout and then I'm gonna hit

547
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:22,760
play and we start seeing the the states

548
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:25,310
actually counting up and if you were to

549
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:29,510
do some sort of correlation analysis

550
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:31,550
there you should be able to I get this

551
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:34,970
back up now I think this is close enough

552
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:36,830
ah give me just a second to get this

553
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:40,870
back up but if you were to actually do

554
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:43,760
some more formal correlation analysis

555
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:46,270
you could you know even start looking at

556
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:50,860
how the internal states worked and such

557
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:53,330
give me just a moments okay perfect so

558
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,979
so that was that was pretty good because

559
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:57,860
now we've demonstrated at least at a

560
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:59,780
proof-of-concept level that we're able

561
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,919
to see these internal logic states too

562
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:03,440
because one of the concerns with

563
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:05,510
something as simple simple as that a

564
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,370
NAND gate that we were just looking at

565
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:09,830
these large current input and output

566
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:11,419
drivers but in these images you know

567
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:13,490
we're able to see plenty of internal

568
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:15,620
logic and if we started playing with

569
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:17,660
things like you know how how it does the

570
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,080
up/down mode work and all that sort of

571
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,730
stuff

572
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,889
we could actually do correlation

573
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:22,440
analysis and figure out which parts of

574
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:26,700
the circuit

575
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:29,610
specifically responsible for that okay

576
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:31,019
so going back to kind of why I was

577
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:33,149
interested in this project in the first

578
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:34,830
place so it turns out that my my

579
00:22:33,149 --> 00:22:38,719
original interest in this was actually

580
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:41,580
not to look at not to look at logic

581
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,840
specifically but actually to floorplan

582
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:47,789
IC so what I was interested in doing was

583
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:50,100
if you said hey you know activate just

584
00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:51,570
the timer circuit you know where where

585
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,149
does this light up on the chip and if

586
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:56,700
you activated the ALU where is this line

587
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:58,500
up on the chip because while this you

588
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,299
know logic level reverse engineering is

589
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,879
very powerful it can be relatively

590
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:05,668
expensive and so I wanted a way to kind

591
00:23:02,879 --> 00:23:07,439
of triage the chip and narrow down to to

592
00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:09,690
where on the chip we actually care about

593
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,509
and one that nice property about this

594
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:13,769
too is that although the feature size on

595
00:23:12,509 --> 00:23:16,200
the things that we're looking at now is

596
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:17,610
pretty large if you're just doing the

597
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,500
floor planning and you don't want to

598
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:21,479
actually look at individual transistors

599
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,970
this should mean that it could scale up

600
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:28,470
to modern chips as well and I think

601
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:30,539
that's one very interesting property but

602
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:32,639
I tried this and at least for my brief

603
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:34,919
test on this chip I wasn't able to get a

604
00:23:32,639 --> 00:23:38,789
sensitive enough measurement to actually

605
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:40,379
see the states but the main focus was

606
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:41,789
finishing up at least the

607
00:23:40,379 --> 00:23:44,100
proof-of-concept at least for this space

608
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:45,658
and so this is something I'll look at a

609
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:49,620
little bit more carefully in the near

610
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:52,830
future the other thing that I looked at

611
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:55,889
was a CMOS logic and basically we're

612
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:58,080
moving lower and lower in power so

613
00:23:55,889 --> 00:24:00,600
whereas the bipolar logic that we looked

614
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,330
at previously it just inherently has a

615
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:08,490
lot of resistors and current flowing

616
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:10,500
this previous chip the the 87 51 is an N

617
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:13,289
Moss process so it's got a little bit of

618
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:15,629
power draw but not as much as the the

619
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:17,158
bipolar logic and then by the time you

620
00:24:15,629 --> 00:24:19,139
get to CMOS you really don't have any

621
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:21,690
resistors at all so this is this is

622
00:24:19,139 --> 00:24:24,418
likely going to be the the hardest to

623
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:25,860
work on and so one way you can get more

624
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:27,929
power because you basically want to

625
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:31,110
spend as much time switching as possible

626
00:24:27,929 --> 00:24:32,940
is to raise the clock frequency and one

627
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:34,469
practical difficulty I had here was I

628
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,790
didn't have a very good signal generator

629
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:37,590
and

630
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:39,120
I need to do some tests where I really

631
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:41,699
start driving this thing closer to its

632
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,929
limit and if I do that I suspect that I

633
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,540
might start seeing something more

634
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:47,490
interesting but I did see you know some

635
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:51,120
of the basic ESD currents as kind of

636
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:53,450
alluded to earlier so another part of

637
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,620
this project was if you start looking at

638
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:58,530
switch gear switching gears a little bit

639
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:00,810
as you look into this sort of analysis

640
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:03,149
you hear backside analysis mentioned a

641
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:05,790
lot so I also wanted to explore this

642
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:07,530
briefly to see you know what does it

643
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:10,050
look like to do this sort of analysis

644
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:11,820
and the basic idea is that especially on

645
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:14,070
a newer chip you might have a lot of

646
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:15,780
metal you know interconnect this is

647
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:18,960
blocking your view to the transistors

648
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:20,190
and if you get so much metal there you

649
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,290
won't actually be able to see the

650
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:24,720
transistor switching so what they do

651
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:27,840
instead is they take advantage of the

652
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:31,110
fact that silicon is roughly transparent

653
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:33,480
around where it starts to emit infrared

654
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:35,100
light and so if you flip the chip over

655
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,810
and you look through the back you

656
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,969
theoretically can see the transistor

657
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:40,139
switching the one caveat though is that

658
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:43,080
there's a fair bit of attenuation

659
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:44,760
through the silicon and scattering so

660
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,860
you want to thin the die as much as

661
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,260
possible to get the best signal possible

662
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:52,560
and whereas a typical die might be

663
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:54,930
somewhere in the 200 to 350 micrometer

664
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:57,500
range you know maybe an iPhone CPU is

665
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:59,460
thin to be on the the lower end of that

666
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,690
you know the chip that I'm going to

667
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:03,330
experiment with here a little bit is

668
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:05,460
about 320 micrometers you really want to

669
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:07,800
get something more in the 25 micrometer

670
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:10,380
range so we're talking about an order of

671
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:13,800
magnitude reduction in the sample

672
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:15,630
thickness okay so the first thing I need

673
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:18,510
to do was I needed a way to look at this

674
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:21,630
and say hey can we actually see can we

675
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:23,430
see through this and what I mean is do

676
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:25,200
we know where were pointed at on the

677
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:27,300
chip to even try to do this as the

678
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,920
emission analysis and so instead of

679
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:31,230
looking for the light emitted by the

680
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,880
chip I'm intentionally illuminating it

681
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:35,130
with infrared light that I believe

682
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,970
should be relatively transparent to the

683
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:40,130
silicon and so I built this custom

684
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:42,540
illuminator so instead of visible light

685
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:44,880
this emits infrared light and can

686
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:46,260
actually see through the silicon and so

687
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,670
I could run a few different tests I also

688
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:49,200
built them in a few different

689
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:52,470
wavelengths and we'll see

690
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,510
a few the next slide and then the next

691
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:56,130
thing is I said okay I need to know how

692
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:59,519
far have we polished through the chip

693
00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:01,080
because the issue is that you know we we

694
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:03,750
don't have just a die we've got to die

695
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:06,750
plus a package and that package is some

696
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:08,340
unknown thickness and maybe irregular so

697
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:10,679
I wanted a way to actually measure how

698
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:12,809
far we had polish to the chip

699
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:15,419
ground through notes and send it out and

700
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:17,129
so what I found was that if I if I use

701
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:19,799
my infrared illuminator to look through

702
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:22,260
the chip and I measured the thicknesses

703
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:24,990
using my microscope after polishing them

704
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:27,059
down to to various thicknesses I found

705
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:29,580
that roughly speaking at least on my

706
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:30,899
setup I got about four every micrometer

707
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,330
I focus because you know there's some

708
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:35,610
optics here that are changing the

709
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:36,779
linearity every micrometer focused

710
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:39,330
through the chip was about five

711
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:42,000
micrometers of actual thickness so now I

712
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:44,519
have a way to to actually verify what

713
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:50,669
the thickness is even if it's still

714
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:52,799
embedded in a larger chip yeah so after

715
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:54,929
that what I said was okay now I'm gonna

716
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:57,990
try to take something easy to to try

717
00:27:54,929 --> 00:28:00,179
back standing on and I looted to earlier

718
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:02,460
that I liked these a 7805 so you know

719
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:05,700
they're very readily available and kind

720
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:08,340
of easy to work with so in particular to

721
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:12,179
one of my concerns was that on how like

722
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:14,699
say a dip dip package puts its bond

723
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:15,899
wires I was afraid that the way that

724
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,059
those are packaged that I might start

725
00:28:15,899 --> 00:28:21,120
grinding through bond wires but on a

726
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:23,309
to-220 the dye is on the very back and

727
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,168
the leads are are closer to the center

728
00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:27,120
of the package and what this means is I

729
00:28:25,169 --> 00:28:29,130
can actually grind quite a bit back here

730
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,370
without any fear of messing up the pins

731
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:34,380
on this chip and they're also not very

732
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:36,330
expensive so you see I've opened up one

733
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,710
from the front side here just to kind of

734
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:39,480
show what it looks like and runs some

735
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:41,070
early tests but ultimately we're gonna

736
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,230
flip this over and we're gonna grind

737
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:44,908
through the backside of the chip to kind

738
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:48,809
of expose these transistors from the

739
00:28:44,909 --> 00:28:51,029
other side and I started doing kind of a

740
00:28:48,809 --> 00:28:53,428
CNC milling to do this with or I started

741
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:55,980
grinding I did try milling but it just

742
00:28:53,429 --> 00:28:57,990
completely like destroyed the chip so no

743
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:00,629
go but grinding seemed to work pretty

744
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:02,490
good except by taking some resistance

745
00:29:00,629 --> 00:29:02,639
measurements are the pins and running

746
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,350
out

747
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,900
test I got convinced that I was actually

748
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:07,469
maybe just did the shaking or something

749
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,030
like that

750
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:10,500
I was actually knocking the pins off

751
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:14,129
internally and they just stopped working

752
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:15,330
and a few other kind of odd behaviors so

753
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:17,760
I wasn't really sure what was going on

754
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:21,030
so I tried a different strategy which is

755
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:23,820
I went to just hand sanding and although

756
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:26,399
hand sanding isn't terribly even what I

757
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:28,649
was able to do was use take advantage

758
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:31,680
that I kind of had a rough idea of what

759
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:33,090
the the initial thickness was and make

760
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:35,640
an assumption that it was relatively

761
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:38,220
even throughout the part and by taking

762
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:41,070
this micrometer and kind of measuring

763
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:43,260
the corners I could see how evenly I was

764
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:45,929
stating it down and make adjustments if

765
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:47,700
I if I favored one side too strongly and

766
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:49,650
it seemed to work pretty well I was with

767
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:51,750
able to get without too much effort I

768
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:54,410
was able to pretty easily get something

769
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:57,120
that was 10 micrometers across even

770
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:58,500
planarity and I think if I was a little

771
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,719
bit careful I should be able to get that

772
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:04,020
below 5 which I think for hand sanding

773
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:06,870
was was not too bad and then so so after

774
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:09,180
doing this I was having some problems

775
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:12,090
and in fact one of the chips even kind

776
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:14,100
of blew up on me so this kind of showed

777
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:16,590
ok it wasn't just the shaking from the

778
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:18,600
the milling machine there was something

779
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:20,850
else going on and I think what I found

780
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,230
was I made some bad assumptions when I

781
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:25,199
thought about you know how thick of a

782
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:27,450
transistor was I had said okay you know

783
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,010
there's a large substrate on this chip

784
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:31,230
we don't really need the Laur at large

785
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:33,780
substrate but it seemed at least based

786
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:35,190
on some empirical evidence that you know

787
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:37,649
it actually need to be fairly deep and

788
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:39,990
at least on this 7805 I think it had to

789
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:41,640
be in the ballpark of 25 micrometer

790
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:45,510
stick for the chip to even really

791
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:47,130
function reasonably and reliably so I

792
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,840
think there may have been some shaking

793
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:50,520
in the milling machine but the really

794
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:54,959
the larger issue was I was just thinning

795
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:57,210
them too much okay so so now I just knew

796
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,860
that don't thin so much and maybe these

797
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:03,450
chips will survive so I did that and

798
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:06,360
what I basically found and these these

799
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:08,430
two images aren't a B but on the left is

800
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:10,439
a frontside image and the right is a

801
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:12,150
backside image and at least to some

802
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,700
degree you can see for example we've

803
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:16,170
lost we've lost one of these dots in

804
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,180
because this is front and

805
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:21,150
we have kind of a mirror image here and

806
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:23,250
you can barely barely see that I don't

807
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:25,350
know if you can't see it over there but

808
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:27,630
you can see a little bit of this guy but

809
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:30,600
it's basically gone and when I did a

810
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:32,430
kind of a more fair test where I might

811
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,540
calibrated the exposure times and

812
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:35,520
getting the same brightness

813
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:37,260
I found that I at least with my sample

814
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:40,080
ship which was I think in the 30

815
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:43,140
micrometer roughly range it was about an

816
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,909
18 times brightness difference and I

817
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:46,440
think if I thin this a little bit more I

818
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:48,990
might have been able to go to 20 maybe

819
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:51,090
25 micrometers I I think that that would

820
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,230
improve a little bit but fundamentally

821
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:54,810
we would probably see a lot more

822
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:56,280
attenuation than the front side so at

823
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:58,230
least for the tests that I'm doing now I

824
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:59,490
don't have any specific need to get in

825
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:02,790
the back side I'm not looking at very

826
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:04,620
dense chips and so with the additional

827
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:07,230
effort of doing the backside analysis

828
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:09,179
the attenuation I'm saying there really

829
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:11,840
was no need to do more backside analysis

830
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:15,750
and I just focused on the the front side

831
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:19,860
I did try briefly one other thing which

832
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:21,930
was to try chemical thinning there's a

833
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:26,610
very solutions you can use potassium

834
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:28,170
hydroxide at t mAh I tried this and it

835
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:31,709
seemed to work decently good I don't

836
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:33,930
only have a scale here but one one thing

837
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:35,640
to note though is that typically in

838
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:37,530
semiconductor facilities you know you're

839
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,930
you're maybe thinning you know a couple

840
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:42,270
of micrometers I'm thinning three

841
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:45,000
hundred micrometers so you know the sort

842
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:47,730
of planarity I need is a lot higher

843
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,590
arguably than you might need in like a

844
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:52,170
fab or something like this so I think

845
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:54,300
this has some potential but ultimately

846
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:55,500
because of the band and backside I'm not

847
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,659
going to think about this too much right

848
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,100
now the other thing that's worth

849
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:01,380
mentioning is you get these sort of

850
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:02,699
slopes as you do this so that

851
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:05,040
potentially could cause some issues

852
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:08,490
depending on the type of analysis you

853
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:10,740
are running another alternative sort of

854
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:13,410
technique I tried was using these in

855
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:15,270
gasps of photodiodes although the the

856
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:17,580
whole cameras are rather expensive you

857
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:19,320
can get individual sensors for not too

858
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:21,929
much unfortunately

859
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,730
the unit I got I think there's something

860
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:25,260
wrong with it

861
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:26,700
like the clicker on the back isn't

862
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,419
really working that well there's some

863
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,519
you know kind of

864
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:34,139
fools that this thing kind of off it

865
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:36,239
does respond to light but I don't know

866
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:38,070
in any case if I switched on these chips

867
00:33:36,239 --> 00:33:40,529
even with relatively high current levels

868
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:43,200
I really couldn't see any any changes at

869
00:33:40,529 --> 00:33:46,200
all on these on these s sensors even

870
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,609
using a very sensitive meter so maybe

871
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,529
something to turn in the future I've

872
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:51,689
heard others getting good results but

873
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:53,549
they had more purpose-built setups and

874
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:54,959
it may be that that I would need to do

875
00:33:53,549 --> 00:33:58,889
something more purpose-built to really

876
00:33:54,959 --> 00:34:00,119
get good results I also tried this this

877
00:33:58,889 --> 00:34:01,769
thing I don't know exactly what these

878
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:04,320
are called but I think they're intended

879
00:34:01,769 --> 00:34:05,700
for like if you have a laser lab and you

880
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,708
want to see where the beam is in the lab

881
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,240
I don't know if they're an intensifier

882
00:34:07,709 --> 00:34:11,190
tube or exactly but you kind of look

883
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:15,000
through them and even when the device is

884
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:17,519
off you can kind of see the room but if

885
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,500
you turn it on it kind of enhances the

886
00:34:17,518 --> 00:34:24,439
infrared light and so when I switch this

887
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:26,668
thing on I'm able to see the V diode and

888
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:29,970
operating like if I use my infrared

889
00:34:26,668 --> 00:34:32,578
illuminator however when I pointed at a

890
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:36,049
microscope or the chip itself I wasn't

891
00:34:32,579 --> 00:34:40,889
able to see anything at all however I

892
00:34:36,049 --> 00:34:45,768
was able to didn't click this time I was

893
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:48,720
able to I was dismantling I was able to

894
00:34:45,768 --> 00:34:50,489
use some night-vision goggles because I

895
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,799
said okay what else is a really

896
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:54,149
sensitive camera and you know these

897
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:57,059
things are designed for operating in

898
00:34:54,149 --> 00:34:59,430
really really low light levels and I 3d

899
00:34:57,059 --> 00:35:03,660
printed a an adapter to fit on the

900
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:06,480
microscope and much to my surprise this

901
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:09,029
actually worked surprisingly well so you

902
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,470
can see a video you see the transistors

903
00:35:09,029 --> 00:35:12,660
just turned on in the upper right hand

904
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:13,950
corner and then you see a faint glow of

905
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:17,879
them as they've kind of reached steady

906
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:21,390
state so while that looks like it may

907
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:23,009
not be as high contrast as some of the

908
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:25,170
other images you have to realize you

909
00:35:23,009 --> 00:35:27,480
know we were pinning this against you

910
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:29,400
know maybe 15 second exposures and

911
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:32,130
therefore some of those images may be a

912
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,720
little bit less for this chip but this

913
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:36,450
thing is running at many frames per

914
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:38,189
second and so I think with a little bit

915
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:40,359
better camera mounting maybe some better

916
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:41,529
gain gain control

917
00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:43,269
cuz that's also an issue I think this is

918
00:35:41,529 --> 00:35:44,950
oversaturating I think this has some

919
00:35:43,269 --> 00:35:46,839
pretty interesting potential the main

920
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:50,279
downside is that these are fairly

921
00:35:46,839 --> 00:35:54,489
expensive compared to the other cameras

922
00:35:50,279 --> 00:35:57,249
so wools we'll see how a plausible this

923
00:35:54,489 --> 00:36:00,839
is in the long run another thing I tried

924
00:35:57,249 --> 00:36:03,730
was looking at implant roms I heard that

925
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:06,099
that these roms which have very small

926
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:08,970
doping differences they changed their

927
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:11,799
response to infrared light depending on

928
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:13,720
whether it was a 1 or a 0 and ideas you

929
00:36:11,799 --> 00:36:16,329
could use this to do for more extraction

930
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:18,399
on certain chips unfortunately I didn't

931
00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:20,140
see any differences at least with some

932
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,640
quick tests I did you see I've got a

933
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:24,069
little LED down here which is basically

934
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:26,589
shining through a chip up there but I'd

935
00:36:24,069 --> 00:36:29,799
like to revisit this tried try 1060 and

936
00:36:26,589 --> 00:36:34,210
if you had a test but no results so far

937
00:36:29,799 --> 00:36:36,089
at least last things is kind of alluded

938
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:39,249
to earlier but I'm gonna try to do this

939
00:36:36,089 --> 00:36:41,109
8750 one and see if I can actually start

940
00:36:39,249 --> 00:36:43,390
identifying the parts on the chip just

941
00:36:41,109 --> 00:36:46,569
based on the emissions I would like to

942
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:48,700
do CMOS at some point to to target more

943
00:36:46,569 --> 00:36:50,140
modern ships and the last thing I kind

944
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,819
of alluded to earlier is there's an

945
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:54,339
alternative technique at least one you

946
00:36:51,819 --> 00:36:56,288
can try to do for this called voltage

947
00:36:54,339 --> 00:37:00,749
contrast imaging where you use a

948
00:36:56,289 --> 00:37:04,329
scanning electron microscope to put

949
00:37:00,749 --> 00:37:06,249
voltage through the chip and you can

950
00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:07,960
actually see depending on the voltage it

951
00:37:06,249 --> 00:37:09,700
will deflect the electron beam and

952
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,829
you're able to read out some of the

953
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,359
circuits operating so at some point I

954
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:17,049
would like to explore that as kind of a

955
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:19,210
related alternative technique so that's

956
00:37:17,049 --> 00:37:22,390
that's basically what I got

957
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:24,339
so I basically would say that you know

958
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:26,379
cooled ccd Zoar the back illuminated

959
00:37:24,339 --> 00:37:30,099
CMOS thing to give good results for at

960
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:32,049
least basic logic chips however you

961
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:33,910
should make sure that you pay very close

962
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:35,288
attention to how you calibrate these

963
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:38,259
because it's they are very sensitive

964
00:37:35,289 --> 00:37:40,359
measurements I was able to get pretty

965
00:37:38,259 --> 00:37:42,940
decent results I would say with bipolar

966
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:47,319
logic without without too much cost I

967
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:49,749
think something n Moss like the 7087 51

968
00:37:47,319 --> 00:37:52,239
is maybe plausible but needs a little

969
00:37:49,749 --> 00:37:54,069
bit more research and I'm a little bit

970
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:56,110
skeptical though due to the much lower

971
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:58,420
power of CMOS at least with with the

972
00:37:56,110 --> 00:38:00,070
test done so far that you're gonna be

973
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:02,110
able to do this with a with a very

974
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:03,700
low-cost setup but of course I'll try to

975
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:06,190
explore that as I push things further

976
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:07,629
and the last is that I wouldn't do

977
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:10,690
backside analysis unless you have a

978
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:12,190
really good reason because it just it

979
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:14,530
just was a lot harder and didn't give us

980
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:16,120
good at signal so anyways I hope you

981
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:19,780
enjoyed that's that's the material I

982
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:22,240
have and if you if this interests you

983
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:25,480
feel free to reach out to discuss and

984
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:27,069
the last thing I'll say is if just on

985
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,950
the off chance you're interested in

986
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:31,390
these illuminators I might do a small

987
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:33,160
run at some point if you're interested

988
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:36,299
in getting way so thanks for listening

989
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:36,299
and let me know if you've any questions

990
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:50,080
do you have questions I'm not sure if I

991
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:52,120
understood you correctly but you said

992
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:54,940
that the dense middle ization causes the

993
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:56,680
IR to not work as well right just simply

994
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,150
because you know you're just you're

995
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,980
shielding it right yeah so it's just

996
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:02,380
something in the way of getting infrared

997
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:03,880
light out but but what this means like

998
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,560
for smart card ships that are like

999
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,180
shielded and you want to act that state

1000
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,190
out of it this would become difficult

1001
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:11,200
using IR even if we were like a more

1002
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:12,610
expensive set up right but then that

1003
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,680
means that you'd have to do the backside

1004
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:15,820
analysis so so if you have the more

1005
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,319
expensive analysis

1006
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:20,020
it just means you'd have to thin the

1007
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:22,270
back and then you would point this more

1008
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:24,130
sensitive camera at the back oh so like

1009
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:26,050
if you mil it down to like 30 or so and

1010
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:27,820
it's still worth the you think I'm more

1011
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:30,130
like expensive setup would still work

1012
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:32,530
yes oh I believe it more expensive most

1013
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:34,930
it's also worth mentioning that I'm not

1014
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:36,370
an expert on smart card security but my

1015
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:40,049
understanding is most of them don't have

1016
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:45,000
any sort of backside countermeasures so

1017
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:45,000
okay all right thank you
