00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,639
i would like to introduce colin oflin

3
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,280
offlin

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,720
who's a friend and a cto of new ae nua

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,720
is an embedded security and consulting

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,560
company based out of canada

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,039
colin will highlight major hardware

8
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,359
attacks and share his thoughts on future

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,039
of hardware security

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,039
and increasing accessibility throughout

11
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,159
the industry

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,480
he is the inventor of chip prospero a

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,559
complete open source tool chain for side

14
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:37,040
channel

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,760
power analysis and glitching attacks for

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,520
those who want to get to know

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,920
also get into also hardware hacking

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,440
please do check out the book

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,200
that colin and jasper have just

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,520
published the hardware hacking handbook

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,520
it's available on no starch press for

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,680
pre-order today

23
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,320
colin we have a request to also have

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,840
luna if she can

25
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,120
join the talk and now over to you

26
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,879
all right thanks very much uh andres for

27
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,879
that introduction and for having me at

28
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:05,680
hardware io

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,119
um this is a great event i i you know

30
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,640
i say not just because you know

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,960
technical people there but the the

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,920
people i know

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,680
when it's in person right it's more

34
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,880
reunion than it is a chance to um

35
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,119
a chance to sort of just get the

36
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,479
technical content so that's the one

37
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,920
thing i think we all miss

38
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,159
um with not doing it in person but um to

39
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,840
give a bit of a different feel i thought

40
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,119
you know what would be fun

41
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,520
and like most ideas it sounds fun until

42
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,200
you start to execute it of course

43
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,119
um is to not use slides so you might

44
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,320
have to make my video big

45
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,640
for this to be legible um hopefully the

46
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,680
zoom compression

47
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,000
isn't killing you here um but yeah we're

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,920
gonna do it live so i have a whiteboard

49
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,000
we have some stuff that we'll look at

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,159
and we're gonna do the talk like this

51
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,079
uh luna is somewhere around here

52
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,840
sleeping so i'll bring her in towards

53
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,200
the end

54
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,960
once they're interested or one once

55
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,240
they're awake a little bit i think you

56
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,439
know they don't care as much about

57
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,320
hardware but they really like uh snacks

58
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,360
um so this this talk is about you know

59
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,640
here's the title slide

60
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,600
um about what i see as the cheapskate

61
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,399
res

62
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,239
revolution i call it but i also want to

63
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,080
emphasize a lot about accessible

64
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,879
hardware

65
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,040
um so what i'm going to kind of go

66
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,160
through quickly

67
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,760
is i first want to look at some

68
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,200
different threat models

69
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,640
and in particular some different attacks

70
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,720
that i think are really interesting and

71
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,959
some of these attacks are friends and

72
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:25,760
colleagues have done

73
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,040
are working on right now but a lot of

74
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,640
them have been done with very low cost

75
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,080
equipment so

76
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,319
if we had this discussion 10 years ago

77
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,000
what people would think is a reasonable

78
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,599
hardware attack is going to look a lot

79
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,319
different

80
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,160
than having it today so i think that's a

81
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,400
pretty interesting place to start

82
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,080
i then want to look at accessible

83
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,080
hardware security so this is where

84
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,400
we're bringing down the cost but the

85
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,400
important thing is not just the cost

86
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,920
uh you know sometimes we can get really

87
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,480
um it costs ten dollars to the attack

88
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,280
that's great

89
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,360
um but also about what else is around it

90
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,800
to sort of help push the industry

91
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,360
forward

92
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,879
and i also want to highlight a few of

93
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,959
the projects that i know of and there's

94
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,840
even more now so it's kind of a call to

95
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,120
you know bring these projects to the

96
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,200
forefront um that are working

97
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,239
in the same area um and to sort of you

98
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,680
know talk about my project in particular

99
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,200
i thought it might be interesting to say

100
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:15,599
well

101
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,280
you know how did we get here how did i

102
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,640
get chip whisper to

103
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,080
to do what it is and a little bit of a

104
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,000
chance to talk about some of the history

105
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
and future of it the other thing i

106
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,400
wanted to look at is you know this is

107
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,400
more offensive security you could say

108
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,599
because we're looking at breaking

109
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,760
embedded systems we're looking at that

110
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,519
but what's the flip side of it because

111
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,360
actually a lot of the projects have been

112
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,239
about

113
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,480
um the low cost offensive tooling is

114
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,840
what we're seeing what

115
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,360
projects are what you know the interest

116
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,040
in research is

117
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,360
and the defensive side has been more

118
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,200
done in industry right it's not very

119
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,879
accessible that's kind of a problem i

120
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,519
think

121
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,879
but that's changing there's actually

122
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,879
been some projects previously that have

123
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:53,680
looked at it

124
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,280
there's some new projects that are

125
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,120
really getting quite popular

126
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,599
so to me it also is a really good time

127
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,120
you know to look at this because when i

128
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,480
kind of started chip whisper it was

129
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,239
pretty early on and

130
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,120
accessible side channel i'd call it um

131
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,280
and to me i see this as the early stages

132
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:09,519
of

133
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,920
accessible hardware security that it's

134
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,439
going to eventually lead to

135
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,040
real chips right that could be open

136
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,160
source that are things you could

137
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,880
actually

138
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,918
look at the designs of um so yeah that's

139
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,759
sort of a plan so

140
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,960
the first part here on threat models

141
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,120
the the question i want to bring up is

142
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,280
if you look at like a new device that's

143
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,800
just been released

144
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,040
how come someone is able to actually

145
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,320
pretty quickly

146
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,120
take that device and recover secret

147
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,560
information from it so i had a few

148
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,600
examples i wanted to look at

149
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,800
one was the uh

150
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,120
air tag so i don't know if uh thomas

151
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,080
roth

152
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,560
stack smashing or leonard are watching

153
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,960
but they had gotten pretty early

154
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,160
um sort of information on these two

155
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,320
um so these are a little you know cheap

156
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,280
apple

157
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,639
product um cheap not in a bad way but

158
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,320
just in a low-cost way

159
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,840
and it's interesting because it was just

160
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,680
released right so this is a cool thing

161
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,440
because it's like a recently released

162
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,479
device

163
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,880
so if we look at what's inside one of

164
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,759
them

165
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,800
um let's see so i have a few that i've

166
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,479
kind of already instrumented here

167
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,479
and it's a little hard to see so i'm

168
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,080
going to move it to a

169
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,160
another camera that is over here

170
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,520
there we go so this is going to be a

171
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,840
little more extreme

172
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,600
i don't have a good in between i'm sorry

173
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,520
so it's either

174
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,800
too too close right now or too far

175
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,560
so give me a second okay

176
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,600
all right so these are ones that have

177
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,520
been a bit instrumented um so on the

178
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,960
back side you just have a bunch of test

179
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,479
points and stuff like that right so

180
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,320
nothing too interesting um

181
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,199
where it's more kind of cool to look at

182
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,080
right is if you take

183
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,560
take a look at the front side of it um

184
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,319
there's a lot of stuff going on here

185
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,160
again

186
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,600
just go back a minute um right so again

187
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,000
this is

188
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,960
a pretty recent device that apple's

189
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,000
released

190
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,680
um and you can see it's using the the

191
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,440
nordic it's a bluetooth device so

192
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,520
somewhat unsurprisingly in the bluetooth

193
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,039
world we have the

194
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,319
nordic nrf um device

195
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,400
you know in this thing so this was an

196
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,160
interesting choice because

197
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,360
prior to the release of this device

198
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,280
there was a presentation by limited

199
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,479
results showing

200
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,960
uh attack on this so it was fairly well

201
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,080
known that you could actually

202
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,600
have fairly you know easy access to this

203
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,039
type of device

204
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,319
and that's the sort of thing so this is

205
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,160
one that i kind of instrumented right

206
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,560
that comes out with with this sort of

207
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,560
accessible

208
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,199
tooling that that is available in the

209
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,400
industry

210
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,800
um and so this is something right where

211
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,080
they apple

212
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,000
probably knew about the threat model or

213
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,360
my assumption is they knew about the

214
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,560
threat model

215
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,680
because it was a known problem um

216
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,720
at the release time that that nrf device

217
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,400
um was known to have this potential

218
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,639
vulnerability when the the

219
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,720
you know air tags were released maybe it

220
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,080
was already in design and they didn't

221
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,759
care but that has to be part of a threat

222
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,199
model right that has to be something

223
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,000
that you're

224
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,400
considering when you're looking at these

225
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,479
types of devices

226
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,880
as another example of sort of a recent

227
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,759
device i

228
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,440
got my hands on and i don't have as much

229
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,039
about this but

230
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,240
this is the the starlink dish so

231
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,240
it's huge right this isn't some weird

232
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,759
forced perspective

233
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,680
i can show you that i'm actually holding

234
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,360
it beside me

235
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,400
so it's this huge device right um what

236
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:40,880
the

237
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,880
the sort of interesting part of it is of

238
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,000
course the the

239
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,560
embedded side so if i go back over here

240
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,960
again

241
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,879
um what do you have so i have some

242
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,240
i pretty recently did a teardown of this

243
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,360
and there's been a great blog post so

244
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,000
leonard

245
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,680
um reuters who has done a lot of tesla

246
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,199
work actually had looked at this first

247
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,879
and we were talking i i managed to get

248
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,800
my hands on one as well

249
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,479
um so he had already identified that you

250
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,160
know you basically have this

251
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,879
embedded linux computer right with just

252
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,319
like test points and stuff like that so

253
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,840
it actually didn't take a lot of

254
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,280
hardware to

255
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,639
um at least be able to dump the emmc

256
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,080
um this particular you know attack

257
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,199
was talked about at black hat um with

258
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,039
like there's a talking on

259
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,399
because i don't have slides i don't have

260
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,320
all the links in it so i could set them

261
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,279
up afterwards

262
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,958
but it was like you know ten dollar

263
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,120
hardware hacking with an sd card reader

264
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,320
something like that

265
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,080
so this was a black ad talk that went

266
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,839
through all of the details of how you

267
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,839
actually dump these devices

268
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,360
um and that was basically it so there's

269
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,200
some additional trickery that

270
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,080
leonard goes over but this is the sort

271
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,640
of you know

272
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,839
really low cost accessible tool

273
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,760
tooling that makes it pretty interesting

274
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,040
to me um

275
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,120
there's more work that kind of will tie

276
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,200
into some of the the glitching stuff on

277
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,880
this to come

278
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,640
but you can see again these are like

279
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,000
brand new

280
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,200
the the date code so if we look um

281
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,640
somewhere here i might go under the

282
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,040
other microscope

283
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,800
because if you look at this just to show

284
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,160
you how kind of fresh this

285
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,519
is right

286
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,440
here on the pcb

287
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,399
i'm sorry it's sideways but this thing's

288
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,600
way too big

289
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,920
um you have 21-14 right there so 21-14

290
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,440
14th week of 2021

291
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,200
so you know the raw pcb was done

292
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,800
in that's like april or something like

293
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,240
that right and i got this at the end of

294
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,640
june

295
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,640
um so that's you can't say that's not

296
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,040
like a quite new product

297
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,760
this is the second rev of it actually so

298
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,959
that's the kind of interesting thing to

299
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:53,760
me is that

300
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,440
in these threat models we now have all

301
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,120
sorts of new things that weren't there

302
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,720
previously um how do we

303
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,440
do so now that we you know say okay this

304
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,920
is potentially a threat

305
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,680
where does the accessible hardware

306
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,920
security come in

307
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,920
and i took a look at two sides of the

308
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,760
the hardware security so starting with

309
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,240
power analysis

310
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,760
where did those projects kind of start

311
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,959
because a lot of people are familiar

312
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:23,920
with chip whisper

313
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,360
which i started in 2012 but

314
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,279
as an example for me learning side

315
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,800
channel there was

316
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,200
what i'm sure a lot of people will know

317
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,720
is the the blue book or the

318
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,880
side channel book or different names for

319
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,760
it um

320
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,920
but this is basically a book on uh side

321
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,279
channel power analysis

322
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,360
right this is kind of goes over that a

323
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,000
lot of the techniques like this is how i

324
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,519
pre this book i didn't know anything

325
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,519
about it

326
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,839
and so you can imagine the accessibility

327
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:52,640
is not just

328
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,480
open source right this isn't an open

329
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,880
source software project

330
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,560
but it can have a huge impact on the

331
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,560
industry and to me that's a big part of

332
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,000
why i want to concentrate on the

333
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,360
accessibility

334
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,120
of the knowledge the accessibility of

335
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,279
the tooling which does not

336
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,440
just mean open source or super cheap or

337
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,120
anything like that

338
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,839
it can be helpful you know there's a lot

339
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,200
of different aspects at play here but

340
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,200
that's the sort of interesting thing

341
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,399
so if you look at at these tools right

342
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,399
opensca was actually part of that book

343
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,839
release so that's why i bring it up

344
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,600
or was related to that with a matlab

345
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,560
scripts that were

346
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,079
were running examples on the um the book

347
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,000
um around the same time so david oswald

348
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,920
also had this giant project

349
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,560
um so this was a project that was pretty

350
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,920
similar to chip whisperer

351
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,800
rev zero actually used the same sort of

352
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,920
board so it could do

353
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,200
glitching and power analysis as well

354
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,640
there's been a number of other side

355
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,000
channel analysis sort of software tools

356
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,920
so and again you might not be familiar

357
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,279
with all of these but they

358
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,839
they do interplay really nicely so

359
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,760
there's a project by riskier that has

360
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,600
information in julia so it has a number

361
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,360
of different attacks

362
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,360
there's a project side channel marvels

363
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,160
so both of these were around 2016

364
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,079
that has some higher performance attacks

365
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,240
including white box crypto attacks

366
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,519
um so i know he would actually often be

367
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,000
at

368
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,880
at hardware io uh physically to to give

369
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,320
some various hardware hacking attacks

370
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,600
but he's done a lot of great work in

371
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,839
this project as well

372
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,959
last car was started by

373
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,440
some people with the ledger research

374
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,880
group so this is a quite high

375
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,120
performance side channel

376
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,880
tool and the interesting thing right is

377
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,959
that i highlight them not to say like oh

378
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,480
there's 20 different things you can use

379
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,680
but for example we use

380
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,800
last car inside of chip whisper even in

381
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,920
our official

382
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,519
demos because it does a really good job

383
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,760
at some higher performance work

384
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,560
that was never the point of our our

385
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,560
project that was often more concentrated

386
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,399
on education

387
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,320
and sort of some flexible research

388
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,839
angles to it

389
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,079
so there's you know more that to to the

390
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,480
accessibility as well than just

391
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,560
having 20 different projects that that

392
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,000
everyone can use

393
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,519
and another one's scared we also have

394
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,880
used this so it implements some

395
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,000
different attacks

396
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,240
um a company e shard has released under

397
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,600
open source some of their

398
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,360
their tooling as well and this is using

399
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,880
similar python and jupiter

400
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,480
ship whisper so it's also a really nice

401
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,839
um device to work with too um

402
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,680
that's just power analysis so that's

403
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,880
actually you know

404
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,720
and i'm gonna erase this so it doesn't

405
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,880
get too

406
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,000
too messy on the board here um

407
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,519
because otherwise it starts to get

408
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,440
really crowded

409
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,040
i find okay

410
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,160
there we go cool

411
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,000
um so glitchers this is like another

412
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
right part of this is so chip whisperer

413
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,839
can do glitch stuff i meant to draw

414
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,920
these lines to the projects that are

415
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,040
over here

416
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,160
but they're i just deleted them so um

417
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,600
right but if you look at glitching which

418
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,760
is uh kind of all the rage now right

419
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,440
that's a really interesting thing

420
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,279
um you can think back to like smart card

421
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,959
and looper so people that are

422
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,120
are working on that um often would you

423
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,800
know use glitchers

424
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,120
in a product mod chip so anyone that's

425
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,120
done installed an xbox mod chip has

426
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,199
installed and you know an automatic

427
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,680
glitcher into their xbox

428
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,079
um so it's pretty interesting to see

429
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,519
this sort of progression of it i didn't

430
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,199
put dates in this one

431
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,880
because it got pretty crowded but

432
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,480
there's also more

433
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,279
glitching projects too um some of them

434
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,680
for example aren't official projects but

435
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,000
the accessibility of the research you

436
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,680
know i've kind of made it a de facto

437
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,920
project so chris kerlinski

438
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,880
i'm sure lots of people have either seen

439
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,600
his glitch

440
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,079
on the lpc series device

441
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,560
so he gave this talk at recon and that

442
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,519
included

443
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,959
some information to recreate it using

444
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,680
low-cost ic and so we ended up

445
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,040
recreating it as well with chip

446
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,680
whisperer

447
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,000
and it's really great demo and it's sort

448
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,320
of all because chris made this available

449
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,959
uh to everyone to you know to share this

450
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,160
research

451
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,399
um there's several other interesting uh

452
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,279
projects too

453
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,160
so um glitching sammy kind of camker had

454
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,440
a version of this

455
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,800
um debug and dump so thomas roth

456
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,760
uh who's did the the apple air tag stuff

457
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,600
he's actually made a really low cost

458
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,480
using a

459
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,279
raspberry pi pico i think right that's

460
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,480
the official name

461
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,199
um uh sort of board so it's like a four

462
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,560
dollar board and then he has some

463
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,920
circuitry around it

464
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,000
um you know and this is accessible not

465
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,120
just because it's cheap

466
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,199
again cheapness alone doesn't mean

467
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,000
accessible but it's accessible because

468
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,240
you can build it pretty easily yourself

469
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,839
when i did chip whisper it needed like a

470
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,839
pretty big fpga and things like that so

471
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,360
this is a pretty cool

472
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,440
thing to see right limited result so i'm

473
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,800
sure many people have seen this work

474
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,440
this is this nrf work i mentioned

475
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,880
now also some silicon labs work and

476
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,360
again using a glitch of their own design

477
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,920
as well as recently an em glitcher

478
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,880
um so the accessibility does not just

479
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,279
mean

480
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,839
if you didn't publish a cool open source

481
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,120
project you didn't help create

482
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,880
accessible research right so

483
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,880
um the fact that limited results had

484
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,320
this pretty open

485
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,040
uh you know examples really detailed in

486
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,040
how it works had videos of it has

487
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,600
actually helped people recreate it

488
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,759
so i also kind of want to point out that

489
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,279
you know it's not just about the

490
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,399
specifics of

491
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,800
a project or a research paper or

492
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,959
something like that

493
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,880
so that's kind of what i see as you know

494
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,560
an example of how we're getting there as

495
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,920
an industry

496
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,360
now the one thing i want to look at next

497
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,120
is okay so what did chip whisperer start

498
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,399
with so when i talk about these

499
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,519
accessibility

500
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,360
you know this changes over time so i

501
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,279
actually found

502
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,120
a few things here

503
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,360
so this was two examples

504
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,079
this was a box this box is labeled

505
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,799
chip whisper light old rev protos right

506
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,959
so you can actually see the progression

507
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,839
um i don't have rev prior to this but

508
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,199
you basically start with

509
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,039
you know and one of the ideas of the

510
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,160
original chip whisperer was using tqfp

511
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,640
which limited the fpga choice so that

512
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,760
you could in theory

513
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,480
hand solder it so this one is like rev

514
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:24,959
one

515
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,319
i think it'll say somewhere

516
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,440
there's this oh yeah cd so i don't know

517
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,559
if it's going to show up in the video

518
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,840
exactly

519
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,520
but it's rev1 so you can see lots of

520
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,240
like oops flywires all over the place

521
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,880
some serial lines switching direction

522
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,200
stuff like that

523
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,240
and it goes onward right to

524
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,120
to other versions so this one i think

525
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,480
this was hand soldered because it looks

526
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,799
like pretty terrible soldering

527
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,320
so you can sort of see see the

528
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,039
progression there

529
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,000
but another thing and this was kind of a

530
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,760
cool thing that that uh

531
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,000
joe grant so a while back as part of

532
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,280
releasing chip whisper one of the

533
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,000
questions around

534
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,400
accessibility is how do you make sure

535
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,039
things

536
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,400
um continue to stay available so

537
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,320
i had sort of experimented with this and

538
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,080
this is an ongoing experiment and you

539
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,760
know can you make a company out of

540
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,120
sort of open source ish accessible

541
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,799
hardware and so sometimes you you want

542
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:23,440
to have

543
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,520
higher costs to be able to you know

544
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,960
actually do do stuff with it

545
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,840
so this was the first rev of like uh

546
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,120
looking at making a

547
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,039
more serious chip whisperer and this box

548
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,039
there's a few of them out there still

549
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,440
so this box was part of an eff auction

550
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,520
that joe grant actually won so he i got

551
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,640
him to sign it

552
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,240
to when he sent it back we swapped him

553
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,760
for a newer chip whisperer

554
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,080
um but you can see right like this is

555
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,919
the these original ones

556
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,039
um were sort of a very early version of

557
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,400
experimenting with

558
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,120
different methods of of designing some

559
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,440
of this stuff

560
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,280
which is in a similar way so the other

561
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,880
demo

562
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,760
i've often done is around another tool

563
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,679
rate chip sharder which is an em fault

564
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,360
injection tool so

565
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,960
um there was a few good examples of this

566
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,280
um with this open source

567
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,200
bad fat tool so this open source bad fet

568
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,240
tool

569
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,160
was a em glitter and basically with em

570
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,600
glitching really quickly so

571
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,720
just to give you the background put my

572
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,200
spray

573
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,760
okay there we go um all we're gonna do

574
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,280
it's pretty straightforward

575
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,640
we're gonna have a coil of wire

576
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,360
basically right and you're gonna have a

577
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,080
chip under it

578
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,520
and under that chip right this is

579
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,280
connected to a board

580
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,640
the idea is that you send a

581
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,760
field through this chip chip right and

582
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,880
this magnetic field is going to induce

583
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,200
in structures on the chip right so the

584
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,720
chip has all sorts of structures it's

585
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,440
going to induce

586
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,799
voltages in on that chip as well so

587
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,640
that in theory is going to change

588
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,880
voltages on nodes which can give us

589
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,120
the effects of the glitching the problem

590
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,159
with this

591
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,679
is to do this the the most common way

592
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,159
is you have a capacitor here

593
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,120
right and you want to switch that

594
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,000
capacitor onto this coil

595
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,679
so we want to switch that capacitor onto

596
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,840
the coil

597
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,159
the the problem is the safe way to do it

598
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,919
would be to connect this to ground

599
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,520
and then put your switch up here so this

600
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,360
is what we do in chip shutter that turns

601
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,360
out to be pretty complicated

602
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,559
so this is one of the things where

603
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,720
there's the question of accessibility so

604
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,880
to do this ended up with a more

605
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,320
expensive design that we had to get

606
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,480
safety certified you know that was

607
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,280
expensive but it could exist which is

608
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,280
where i consider it more accessible the

609
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,880
other option and this is what you can do

610
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,720
in a lot of open source tools

611
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,039
so you can kind of have both coexisting

612
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,720
safely

613
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,880
is if you put your switch in the bottom

614
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,919
side

615
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,919
right this is actually electrically

616
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,480
pretty straightforward

617
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,039
because your switching voltage is now

618
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,640
referenced to ground up here the

619
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,320
switching voltage was referenced to some

620
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,840
higher voltage

621
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,320
so this is actually much nicer to design

622
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,240
much cheaper you can really easily make

623
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,159
these types of glitches

624
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,919
um the downside so this is where the

625
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,559
issue is is that right if this is at 500

626
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,000
volts

627
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,360
and this switch is open then your coil

628
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,919
over here is at 500 volts all the time

629
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,080
so that's kind of the the quick

630
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,360
note on the difference here and the coil

631
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,280
what this looks like um is

632
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,880
you basically i don't know if this will

633
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,440
be too close

634
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,840
you have kind of a coil let me try this

635
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,360
a wire with a ferrite

636
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,000
um and this coil of wire here

637
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,679
is there you go so you can see this coil

638
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,760
right so this is like a four millimeter

639
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,120
ferrite so not you know not

640
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,000
super tiny not that complicated to build

641
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,640
um and that's pretty interesting because

642
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,679
you can go ahead and glitch stuff right

643
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,039
like through the case so the demo i'm

644
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,159
often doing

645
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,360
is uh because it makes it really obvious

646
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,799
to show

647
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,080
is this trezor bitcoin wallet so we'll

648
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,720
plug that in

649
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,240
and what you can see here right is i

650
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,240
might have already broken it

651
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,600
unknown bootloader so it shouldn't be

652
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,280
saying that but i was using this for

653
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,720
another demo

654
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,240
but you basically can glitch it through

655
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,840
the enclosure

656
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,120
so the interesting thing is you might

657
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,120
see it go into weird states so there you

658
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,200
can see stack smashing detected

659
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,799
um so there are some different so i'd

660
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,480
give a talk about glitching this over

661
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,840
usb

662
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,320
it turns out you can glitch some of the

663
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,840
the different types of

664
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,120
um read protection on the

665
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,720
microcontroller itself so that's what's

666
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,720
pretty interesting

667
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,960
the other thing around accessibility

668
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,679
is that i've also started to ask a

669
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,039
question i asked this last year but it

670
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:17,679
kind of got

671
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,600
distracted in the pandemic you know

672
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,720
could you glitch with

673
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,720
old technology so this was a fun project

674
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,919
i built

675
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,480
that basically uses like all discrete

676
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,360
logic

677
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,760
with a multiplexer to actually do

678
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,720
voltage glitching

679
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,280
so um it's something that i've pushed

680
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,400
out a little bit but

681
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,320
it's kind of a fun project so if anyone

682
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,159
is interested let me know

683
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,000
um and you basically have like a simple

684
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,440
example board that you can

685
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,559
can glitch to show this so um that was

686
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,919
sort of some of the

687
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,159
you know the interesting things i see is

688
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,559
that the accessibility of these tools

689
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:51,520
has made the

690
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,400
attacks you know a lot more common um

691
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,559
but it also means that the attacks

692
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,360
um there's more tools that come out of

693
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,880
it it kind of feeds itself which is what

694
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,520
i think is

695
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,240
is pretty cool so a lot of the the

696
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,679
future of this that we're going to be

697
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,360
working on is we do have updated

698
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,880
hardware in progress so if you're on the

699
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,640
chip whisperer um

700
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,400
git you might notice some some tools

701
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,320
chip whisperer husky

702
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,000
is a newer capture board in bergen but i

703
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,440
don't have those with me so

704
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,640
i can't uh can't show that fully um

705
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,760
the other thing i wanted to mention

706
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,279
though is this defensive project and

707
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,080
this is i think

708
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,520
an interesting um interesting thing that

709
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,480
is gonna be you know pretty useful for a

710
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,840
lot of people as they're building their

711
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,559
expertise

712
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,720
and these defensive projects are

713
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,919
actually now doing like

714
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,600
open source sort of root of trust type

715
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,600
devices so this

716
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,279
really started there was a project

717
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:47,200
cryptek alpha

718
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,559
um and so this kryptek group actually

719
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:51,039
built

720
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,799
a fpga design um and so this was around

721
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,600
2015. i'm just going by memory here

722
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,080
um ish sometime in there and so there's

723
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,320
open source cores for aes ecc

724
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,520
stuff like that so if you're working on

725
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,200
hardware security this is a really good

726
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,120
resource for you to understand

727
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,039
what's you know coming down the pipe so

728
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,360
to speak

729
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,200
um another project so this one didn't

730
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,799
become quite as popular as i thought it

731
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,159
might be another project you might have

732
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,120
heard of

733
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,600
is open titan so this is something that

734
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,200
will probably also be of a lot of

735
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,279
interest because this is

736
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,200
hopefully going to end up becoming an

737
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,520
asic so this is an open source root of

738
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,320
trust

739
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,520
based on a risk 5 processor right with

740
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,840
hardened aes ecc core stuff like that

741
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,440
and it's all open so you can actually go

742
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,080
ahead and look at it right now

743
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,760
there's other projects that have also

744
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,360
recently started so

745
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,320
um one that is probably also relatively

746
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:48,880
mature

747
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,760
is part of the be trusted i think that

748
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,840
io

749
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,760
so this was part of bunny's project part

750
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,039
of a larger system

751
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,279
right of designing how do you trust a

752
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,080
device a

753
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,039
cell phone a laptop something like that

754
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,320
so that was part of his

755
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,159
overall goal so there's actually an open

756
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,080
source root of trust there

757
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,600
the other one i'll mention that i don't

758
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,600
know if there's code yet is tropic

759
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,640
i think it's called tropic square

760
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,279
um and so this was some of the uh trezor

761
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,880
wallet guys looking at an open source

762
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,000
weirdo trust but

763
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,600
but this is cool because to me this is

764
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,080
like the beginning of that phase of

765
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,320
you know there's a few projects um in

766
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,679
some cases they're getting quite popular

767
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:28,640
like the open titan

768
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,279
um and be trusted projects but we're

769
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,120
starting to see what i see is the

770
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,400
the sort of next gen of actual um

771
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,080
work on open source and accessible

772
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,440
not just fully open source but

773
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,679
accessible hardware security

774
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,159
you know defense and this is really cool

775
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,279
because it means

776
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,559
you know you might be able to use this

777
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,559
in your designs but from a research

778
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:51,440
perspective

779
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,039
it's hopefully going to push forward a

780
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,520
lot of the the work we're doing

781
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,559
um so yeah i think that was you know the

782
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,240
main thing and i promised dogs so i got

783
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,919
to find them still

784
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,159
the main thing right was that i really

785
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,360
want to push

786
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,520
that there's a lot of this accessibility

787
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,480
is is becoming

788
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,480
something that's really important and

789
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,080
accessibility doesn't just mean open

790
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,000
source right it can be the blog post

791
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,919
it can be going to the the conference

792
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,279
presentations

793
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,279
giving presentations giving workshops

794
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,480
right i

795
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,559
i don't want people to come away and say

796
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,600
the only way to

797
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,320
to do this is to have an open source uh

798
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,039
design so okay here's one luna

799
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,279
come on sorry i'm yelling in your ear my

800
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,880
dog's name potentially but

801
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,080
here we can switch cameras and then i

802
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,840
can bring her over

803
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,720
let's try this oh there you go you can

804
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,360
see her

805
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,679
all right friends that's the keynote

806
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,399
speaker of the day

807
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,399
so yeah so if you have any questions i

808
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,960
think we have a um

809
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,760
oh there's the other one uh we have a

810
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,320
breakout room i can go to

811
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,840
okay and there's dog too

812
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,480
here you go

813
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,200
um so yeah thanks very much for

814
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,039
attending um attending hardware of

815
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:17,600
course

816
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,640
is the always a great part to a

817
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,320
part place to be a part of um and yeah

818
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,480
i think andrew will hand back to you for

819
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,240
for the next

820
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,799
all right uh thank you colin uh for

821
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:31,279
sharing

822
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,200
uh i don't know how many years of

823
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,200
experience uh with all of us

824
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,360
there are a few questions uh uh there's

825
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,480
one question uh

826
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,720
from riddhi if someone wants to start

827
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,320
learning hardware security what's the

828
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:42,880
first

829
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,640
hands on experience you would recommend

830
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,159
um so a lot of it's just finding

831
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,679
something interesting right

832
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,000
so i guess i should say buy my buck

833
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,200
right now that should be the

834
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,960
the prime but no the the real thing is

835
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,720
find something interesting and just

836
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,799
take a look at it so this was um in

837
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:05,200
let's use this camera maybe

838
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,799
so in we're just moving offices

839
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,200
and in the building i was at it came

840
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,520
with some readers some like card readers

841
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,600
right so and then i was able to find

842
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,880
extra ones but it was cool because it

843
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,799
was like a system that i had

844
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,919
um and so i i

845
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,360
just kind of took it apart you find some

846
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,520
test points you can you know hack on it

847
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,840
so to speak

848
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,320
is i think one of the best things it's

849
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,399
hard to know ahead of time

850
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,720
what's a good target if you can find

851
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,640
some cheaper stuff is

852
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,200
is often interesting but it's pretty

853
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,720
interesting to look at something that

854
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,880
other people haven't so these particular

855
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,559
ones there wasn't a lot of

856
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,720
um previous work on and you know that

857
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,919
that made it kind of interesting

858
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,760
anything new like the air tags or the

859
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,600
starlink stuff is pretty cool

860
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,720
um the tag ones are not a bad example

861
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,279
because there's some good uh videos so

862
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,559
like thomas roth made this really

863
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,159
detailed video of it

864
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,440
um and shows how to actually

865
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,080
you know recreate this type of attack so

866
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,559
um

867
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,640
it's one of those things we're kind of

868
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,840
jumping in

869
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,399
could work really well uh you might have

870
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,000
a few false starts so the other thing

871
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,679
i'd say is if you do this if you just

872
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:16,880
jump in on a random

873
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,720
device to be like i'm interested how

874
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,200
this works how security works on it

875
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,960
it might be really bad there's lots of

876
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,279
devices i look at where it's

877
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,679
a hassle to be honest so i don't go

878
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,200
through and fully analyze it because

879
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,080
it's like ah

880
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,520
you know it's a device that no one knows

881
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,120
how to unlock

882
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,360
and there's no test point so you're

883
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,679
going to have to spend a lot of time

884
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,200
and if you can kind of go through a few

885
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,399
different devices you might find

886
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:41,200
something

887
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,200
that makes it a lot more interesting to

888
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,919
get started with

889
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,120
all right colin there's another question

890
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,960
that's come to me in private

891
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,080
uh it's also quite uh i think for

892
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,440
somebody who's just a

893
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,519
beginner getting into hardware security

894
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,120
what are the recommended tools

895
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,840
uh that one should have uh to start

896
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,440
getting into the basics of

897
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,440
iot security hacking so basically i

898
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,440
think the question is what tools

899
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,799
should he have in the lab

900
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,360
and this is a good question it depends a

901
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,559
little bit on

902
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,960
what you're doing which is a bad answer

903
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,559
but it's also you don't have to run out

904
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:19,039
and spend

905
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,559
a ton of money is i think the important

906
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,279
thing so uh this was a cool

907
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,320
so thomas roth this debugging and dump

908
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,600
tool he was making

909
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,039
uh used a raspberry pi pico um

910
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,360
to give you like usb uart and spy and

911
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,559
some other stuff

912
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,600
um joe fitzpatrick has this like ftdi

913
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,200
tool that can talk to a lot of different

914
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,640
interfaces

915
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,039
normally i think the basics for anyone

916
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,720
is always going to be you end up needing

917
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,320
an oscilloscope so

918
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,159
that can be one of the more expensive

919
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:49,760
ones i know like back when i was just

920
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,360
getting started in electronics it's

921
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,399
something i've

922
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,320
tried to avoid buying for a while

923
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,320
because it's expensive

924
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,240
but to see you know what's happening at

925
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,440
the hardware level

926
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,080
is is pretty key and it's also nice

927
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,600
because there's now a big range of it

928
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,320
um there's really low cost ones there's

929
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,399
higher cost ones and stuff like that

930
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,559
once you have an oscilloscope you end up

931
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,799
with wanting some digital logic

932
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,760
so salier logic analyzers are really

933
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,480
good i

934
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,840
like them a lot i use them quite a bit

935
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,640
and from there you'll end up needing at

936
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,640
least some sort of like spy or uart

937
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,840
interface

938
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,919
the common one is ftdi based and it

939
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:29,760
works pretty well to be honest so

940
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,519
joe fitzpatrick's tool i like but

941
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,519
there's a few others there too

942
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,360
um yeah but beyond that there is some

943
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,360
good lists online so

944
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,720
we're putting together actually for this

945
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,000
this book we're putting together a

946
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,640
github

947
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,480
and have quite a few tools we're going

948
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,679
to list there

949
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,480
there are a few other git projects i've

950
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,200
come across

951
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,519
um mark large cardinal on twitter

952
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,240
he has some good lists as well and you

953
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,840
know they'll link to other ones

954
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,519
there is one more question uh in em file

955
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:02,480
injection attack

956
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,399
what according to you is better pulse

957
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,480
pattern for glitching most of devices do

958
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,559
we need multiple pulse or one pulse per

959
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,960
cycle is good enough

960
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,960
um good question so the weird thing with

961
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,360
glitching is it can be hard to answer

962
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,399
because

963
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,640
you kind of get an end effect and you

964
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,440
don't know

965
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,519
always what caused it so i've looked at

966
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:24,399
glitching where

967
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,440
i do use multiple um you know in a row

968
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,039
and it needs to be multiple but in the

969
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,960
end i find out you know a single pulse

970
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,880
of a lower amplitude actually worked

971
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,080
pretty well so it seems like the

972
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,840
multiple in a row were just averaging

973
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,480
a lot of what i end up doing is just one

974
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,039
pulse

975
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,440
um most of the targets i'm looking at

976
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,039
the caveat there is most of the targets

977
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,159
i'm looking at

978
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,640
aren't protected against this so if you

979
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,720
start getting into protected targets

980
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,480
you also really can get to the point

981
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,080
where it's you know not just you need

982
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,919
multiple pulses to skip something but

983
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,279
you want to

984
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,880
um you know cause two checks to fail or

985
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,480
two checks to be skipped

986
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,360
um so that's a hard question to answer

987
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,279
you can get away with one so if it's a

988
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:07,919
question of

989
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,560
tool capability you know and all you

990
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,159
have is a tool that can do a single

991
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,440
pulse because you know

992
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,320
self-building something or whatever i

993
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,280
wouldn't discount

994
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,918
it as a very valid use case of just a

995
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,679
single pulse

996
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,760
you know if you can do multiple there

997
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,280
are some use cases where that's really

998
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,079
handy

999
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:35,760
but i wouldn't say it's necessary

1000
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,919
yeah any other questions or

1001
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:49,839
okay

1002
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,239
sorry i was saying and i didn't realize

1003
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,200
i was on mute

1004
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,760
uh how do you start how do you get

1005
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,359
started in medical device

1006
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:05,920
testing ah good question so i the i

1007
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,000
i don't have a great answer to that um i

1008
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,280
know there's other people have done more

1009
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,359
with medical i actually

1010
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,560
ended up not really talking about it

1011
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,920
at the beginning of the pandemic there

1012
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,200
was some interesting thing this is like

1013
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,440
a side story around medical and a hint

1014
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,680
at what good devices are to look at

1015
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,118
um so the resmed

1016
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,560
cpap machines they um

1017
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,400
break this down so you have the

1018
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,880
reference

1019
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,320
so resmed um

1020
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,240
so they have these like cpap bipap right

1021
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,079
so you have cpap

1022
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,200
you have bipap and there was concern

1023
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,880
if we couldn't get enough ventilators at

1024
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,640
the time right it's funny thinking back

1025
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,280
to

1026
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,000
pandemic beginning uh when it was like

1027
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,960
wash your hands

1028
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,720
like breathe heavily on each other

1029
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,480
that's fine but if you wash your hands

1030
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,599
it's uh it's good um and so right at the

1031
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,200
time the the question was could we use

1032
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,599
the bipaps as a replacement for

1033
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:04,640
ventilators

1034
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,000
um because they had poor

1035
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,520
they were like a potentially a poor

1036
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,680
man's ventilator because they use two

1037
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,520
pressures to help you breathe

1038
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,079
cpap is just constant pressure not you

1039
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,680
definitely not useful

1040
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,079
so resmed makes both of these machines

1041
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,680
the cost difference is substantial

1042
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,280
between both of these machines

1043
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,880
both of these machines physically look

1044
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,839
exactly the same

1045
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,920
entirely the same if you take them apart

1046
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,200
they look the same very suspicious

1047
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,240
these machines use an stm and in fact

1048
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,079
they don't even have protection on it so

1049
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,560
they have a

1050
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,800
stm32 inside it um

1051
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,480
and it kind of turned out that the

1052
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,560
difference between a cpap and a bipap

1053
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,200
which is

1054
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,560
different billing prices different

1055
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,560
everything is in fact the firmware

1056
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,599
running on the stm32

1057
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,040
so it's a pretty interesting device to

1058
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,400
look at there's actually now some people

1059
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,760
that have been trying to make like open

1060
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,520
source firmware to run on them and stuff

1061
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,480
like that

1062
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,079
um so they're a pretty fun thing

1063
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,760
uh it kind of it turned out that it

1064
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,440
wasn't really necessary in the end and

1065
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,200
there's a lot of questions about

1066
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,040
this company and the billions of dollars

1067
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,280
they have and are they going to sue you

1068
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,200
that made it less interesting to go

1069
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,640
further on but there's a few of these

1070
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,240
ventilators that actually use a pretty

1071
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,520
similar design

1072
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,320
or not ventilators um with cpaps use a

1073
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,079
pretty similar design and can be an

1074
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,160
interesting place to get started

1075
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,839
besides that it's a lot of like what you

1076
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,839
can find right so if you look at a lot

1077
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,119
of people that have done

1078
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,200
medical research it's often because they

1079
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,839
had like an insulin pump or something

1080
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,000
so if you're able to find the devices on

1081
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,480
ebay also could be a pretty cool

1082
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,440
way to get started

1083
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,400
all right uh colin there's one more

1084
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,240
technical question but i would recommend

1085
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,839
sanjay to take it up with you in the

1086
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,119
breakout room

1087
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,240
uh so yeah thank you so much colin

1088
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,040
uh for sharing and uh being our keynote

1089
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,680
speaker

1090
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,000
friends this is the book uh colin and

1091
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,760
jasper has written together

1092
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,160
uh go out there pre-order it from no

1093
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:04,960
starch press

1094
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,320
uh you guys can get into hardware

1095
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:08,960
hacking

1096
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,119
by at least references from the books

1097
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,720
and some interesting stories mentioned

1098
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,118
over here

1099
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,119
thanks so much again for having me enjoy

1100
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:30,640
thank you so much thank you colin
