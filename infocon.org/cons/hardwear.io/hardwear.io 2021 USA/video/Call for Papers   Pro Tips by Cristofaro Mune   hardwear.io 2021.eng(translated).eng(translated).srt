00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,720
hi everyone i'm christopher monet from

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,919
realize

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:05,680
i would like to share a few words on my

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,919
experience with the hardware dot io

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,840
i've been presenting at the conference a

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,880
few times the first one in 2017

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,280
when with my friend nick timmers we

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,960
presented how to escalate

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,960
privileges in linux by using voltage

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,640
vault injection

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,680
it was a in europe in amsterdam but i

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,039
also had the luck and honor of

13
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,160
presenting

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,279
the first usa edition in 2019

15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,920
where i discussed how to perform remote

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,120
timing attacks

17
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,520
on devices by using hardware

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,559
timestamping

19
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,719
which is now more commonly present on

20
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,200
the ethernet card

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,520
also our trainings on sedu boot and

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,760
trusted execution environments are often

23
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,600
available in the context of the

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,360
of the conference in a nutshell

25
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,280
my experience with arduino has been

26
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,520
great the

27
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,920
topics which are selected are usually

28
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,520
very interesting to

29
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,160
an audience which is interesting in

30
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,720
hardware and device security

31
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,400
and presenters are usually top notch

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,360
and going through the cfp and the

33
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,600
experience with the overall stuff is

34
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,439
also

35
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,479
really really really enjoyable um we

36
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,720
usually consider hardware derailleur one

37
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,320
of our first choices when

38
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,240
we want to present our research our

39
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,360
research usually is a

40
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,720
lies behind hardware and software we

41
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,040
like to be a bit him behind

42
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,759
and as you have seen let's say the

43
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:34,799
topics which are

44
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,560
accepted at the conferences or

45
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,400
discussing in the context are

46
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,759
quite broad we go from purely hardware

47
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,799
talks like fault injection and silicon

48
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:45,920
grade

49
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,040
silicone level talks but also to device

50
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,840
and iot

51
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,200
and so on so anything related to

52
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,079
even embedded software or site channel

53
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,200
analysis

54
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,399
or done both on

55
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,520
cpu microarchitectural level on

56
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,520
other means of performance and general

57
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,119
analysis is also in the scope of the

58
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,239
conference

59
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,639
so for us is all really interesting

60
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,080
because it's part of the

61
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,440
kind of research that we do every day

62
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,400
so now the cfp is open and if you are

63
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,160
interested in this kind of topics i

64
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,120
would uh

65
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,400
very much recommend to consider

66
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,879
hardware.you for your submission

67
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,280
and before going on just a few tips for

68
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,280
uh submitting to cfp

69
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,440
they do apply not only to hardware.you

70
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,400
but to any other conference and maybe

71
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:36,800
you

72
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,360
can find them useful the first thing to

73
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,440
do before submitting to cfp

74
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,599
and even before starting your research

75
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,959
is making sure

76
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,800
that you are informed what has been

77
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,480
already done and researched

78
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,560
no one wants to present something which

79
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,400
has been

80
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,360
submitted like hey this has been never

81
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,080
done before

82
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,560
and while actually it's been presented a

83
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,599
few years before

84
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,720
even at the same conference

85
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,680
so research your ground very well also

86
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,760
because it may give you some

87
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,200
new ideas and may frame your research

88
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,400
much better

89
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,760
and also give new angles to convey

90
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,640
for your research the same aspect that i

91
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,840
would like to stress

92
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,080
is that being successful at your

93
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,000
research

94
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,560
is not a requirement for having an

95
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,799
interesting research

96
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,959
we have beautiful research with negative

97
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,360
results which inspired

98
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,480
much more research on some topics even

99
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,319
if they were not successful in first

100
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,000
place so

101
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,599
don't be discouraged if you have not

102
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,959
achieved the results you have

103
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,319
you were aiming to achieve also because

104
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:48,799
i mean

105
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,920
the process the learning path the

106
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,760
understanding that you have gained the

107
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,080
conclusion you have reached can still be

108
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,439
useful to anybody so

109
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,400
don't be afraid of submitting a research

110
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,200
which can be

111
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,920
which is valuable even if the results

112
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,120
are not so

113
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,560
uh excellent or as excellent as you as

114
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,239
you would have expected

115
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,400
the final tip that i would like to uh

116
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,320
for you to consider is be thorough

117
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,000
in your cfp submission first

118
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,240
it may help you in framing and

119
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,360
understanding

120
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,960
what you would like to convey to an

121
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,040
audience but also helps

122
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,600
the cfp community in order to better

123
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,280
understanding your point of view and

124
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,000
what is the value of your research

125
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,680
don't forget to clearly explain the

126
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,040
impact don't forget to clearly

127
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,080
explain also the methodology

128
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,800
that you followed and why it's relevant

129
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,520
because it

130
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,360
not only the results may be relevant in

131
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,840
themselves but also in the impact in the

132
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,720
surrounding world and ecosystem so i

133
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,360
would say

134
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,759
uh take your time to fill your cfp be

135
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,000
respectful of your research of your work

136
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,440
but also all the

137
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,000
work from other people that are trying

138
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,639
to make

139
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,680
any conference uh the best event

140
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,720
that could be delivered at the time so

141
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,160
don't be afraid uh

142
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,520
try to submit if you are interested in

143
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,880
these topics hardware.you is a

144
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,440
very welcoming conference that allows to

145
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,560
host

146
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,440
anything that is a from hardware to low

147
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,160
level

148
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,639
server and software related anyway i

149
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,520
think i've said more than enough

150
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,160
i look forward to see your research on

151
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,520
stage at hardwood radio

152
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,840
thank you very much

153
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,840
you
