1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:07,710
[Music]

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,599
all right

3
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,360
so this session is going to be super

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,640
interesting and cool

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,640
it's on silicon security we've been

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,240
talking about it for the past

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,720
two days now but this is going to be

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,640
much cooler because we have

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,279
experienced panelists who come from

10
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:27,840
various

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,279
industry backgrounds uh axel poshman

12
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,920
who's the head of senate labs uh rob

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,320
wood

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,160
who's the head of uh hardware team

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,760
at ncc group and matthew arino

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,760
uh who's part of the intel hardware

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,879
security team

18
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,360
today uh most of them will talk on

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,480
various topics

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,800
uh when it comes to hardware security

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,640
some stuff related to

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,440
open source hardware wrist 5 and how

23
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,800
silicon vendors

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,800
what silicon vendors are doing to

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,239
address technical

26
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,120
uh vulnerabilities that inherit in the

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,879
vendor provider ips

28
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,680
so i will uh let the panelists introduce

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,560
themselves

30
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,439
uh rob is going to be the moderator and

31
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,560
uh

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,920
so we can start

33
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:27,839
can i have the panelist on spotlight

34
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,920
i hope my panelists then go to the

35
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,000
breakout room okay here they are okay

36
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,439
all right i see axel hello hi rob

37
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,639
hi matthew hi everybody howdy

38
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,919
rob you can start

39
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,840
i think you are nude still rob

40
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,560
how's that is that better there we go

41
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,759
every time i switch back and forth to

42
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,119
the breakout room it uh

43
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,680
it switches the wrong microphone okay

44
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,040
well uh

45
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,239
i guess this is the last session of the

46
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,399
day so uh welcome everybody for sticking

47
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:10,959
around

48
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,959
this late uh for some of you i know it

49
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,360
was at least one person uh overseas uh

50
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,280
late late at night um but obviously

51
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,480
we're all here because we have a shared

52
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,120
interest in

53
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,040
in hardware security uh of course all of

54
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,120
our modern hardware has

55
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,120
has some silicon devices inside which

56
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,560
runs all the software and firmware that

57
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,680
we rely on for

58
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,000
our features and so we've basically just

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,360
assembled a small panel here

60
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,360
uh to have an informal discussion on on

61
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,040
some of the issues that we see

62
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,480
uh largely from from the design side

63
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,879
so of course as hardware becomes you

64
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:41,760
know more

65
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,360
feature-rich and complicated the

66
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,879
firmware is often used to tame that

67
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:45,760
complexity

68
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,120
uh so we have you know complex state

69
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,120
machines and protocols are like

70
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,080
usb and thunderbolt pci express etc

71
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,120
these are often

72
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,800
barely feasible without having some sort

73
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,560
of firmware uh under the covers and and

74
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,040
that

75
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,280
firmware is often invisible to to the

76
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,480
user you know it's not running on the

77
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:00,879
host

78
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,280
cpu it's running on some embedded cpus

79
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,000
deep in

80
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,120
in the chip sets um and so so with me

81
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,720
here i have uh matt arino

82
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,239
uh he's currently at intel uh he's

83
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,599
worked in hardware security role at a

84
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,720
number of employers

85
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,040
uh and an axel pushman who's currently

86
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,040
with zenith labs uh he's worked

87
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,000
previously at

88
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,280
nxp and uh some academia uh

89
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,680
posts in his previous life uh and i'll

90
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,280
just let them introduce themselves

91
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,239
uh why don't we start with axel hi

92
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,159
thanks rob uh thanks everybody for

93
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,319
uh listening in and for inviting me to

94
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,360
the panel

95
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,040
uh i did my phd in uh lightweight crypto

96
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,159
i was christopher in bochum germany that

97
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,959
was in 2009 when i did some

98
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,840
postdoc and system professor academic

99
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,920
research mostly lightweight crypto

100
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,239
site channel county measures um in

101
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,920
singapore for five years

102
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,400
and then i started nxp in 2014 i guess

103
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,400
back in hamburg germany as head of

104
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,799
vulnerability analysis which is the

105
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,480
side channel fault injection invasive

106
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,959
hardware attack internal red team if you

107
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:05,519
want for

108
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,120
nxp high security products and in 2017 i

109
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,599
moved

110
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,799
over to abu dhabi in the uae and started

111
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,239
at zenith labs which is a test and

112
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,760
validation lab

113
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,880
uh and now i'm heading the lab

114
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,079
since april and that's me

115
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,720
in a nutshell

116
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,320
thank you matt sure

117
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,520
uh so i'm matthia reno um i did my phd

118
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,880
at the university of new mexico

119
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,520
under jim plusqualique uh focusing at

120
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,479
that time on

121
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,240
puff solutions and how to use pops

122
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,320
inside of crypto engines and

123
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,919
for enhancing security on embedded

124
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,720
systems i started my career at sandia

125
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,600
national labs

126
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,280
worked there for six years and then

127
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,080
eventually moved over to raytheon

128
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,080
at both places was primarily doing

129
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,639
offensive uh security research

130
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,560
uh doing red teaming type of efforts for

131
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,800
think things apart seeing how

132
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,160
they can be manipulated and then

133
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,280
eventually got brought over to the

134
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,000
defensive side of the house

135
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,759
and figured who better to build the

136
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,360
defenses and the person who's

137
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,840
spending all their time breaking it and

138
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,039
then in 2019

139
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,280
came over to intel i'm now the lead of

140
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,520
the security assurance and cryptography

141
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,400
group

142
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,680
within intel and grateful to be here in

143
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,960
this conference and

144
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,479
thrilled to have the opportunity to chat

145
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,560
thanks uh and i'm rob wood i didn't

146
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,840
introduce myself i realized

147
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,759
uh i work at ncc group i've been

148
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,520
consulting here for six years i run our

149
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,199
hardware and embedded systems practice

150
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,360
uh in previous lives i had a long

151
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,039
history of embedded systems development

152
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,080
mostly in the smartphone

153
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,479
space uh through blackberry and motorola

154
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,440
a few others

155
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,400
um but what we do now is is we we

156
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,840
consult we we help a lot of

157
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,440
uh companies who are designing and

158
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,960
building the technology that we rely on

159
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,160
every day

160
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,160
with you know their security aspects uh

161
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,759
we work with a lot of chipset

162
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,120
vendors and and semiconductor

163
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,960
manufacturers and so we see a lot of

164
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,919
trends across

165
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,000
the industry and so uh that's why i

166
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,039
tricked you asked me to

167
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,840
to help with this particular session uh

168
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,039
so the first topic i want to

169
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,960
cover here is about open hardware um you

170
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,319
know in the last 20 years or so it seems

171
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,680
at least to me that our computing

172
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,800
platforms have gotten

173
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,960
ever more closed you know the rom micro

174
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,919
code and firmware

175
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,759
is distributed binary only it's often

176
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,520
encrypted it's definitely signed

177
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,280
uh it basically makes it difficult for

178
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,639
you know the clever users to go and

179
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,440
modify

180
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,600
their systems and add features um

181
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,520
innovation often starts by modifying

182
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,240
existing platforms and solutions so um

183
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,360
of course there's always considerable

184
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,199
effort by the community to reverse

185
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,199
engineer those and learn whatever we can

186
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:33,759
to

187
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,360
to figure out how those work and extend

188
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,280
them uh but that's not easy uh and of

189
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,720
course you know some of the other

190
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,800
uh folks here uh who've spoken earlier

191
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,880
today can attest to the level of effort

192
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,919
that they've gone through

193
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,440
uh to kind of get that information out

194
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,960
of there um

195
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,120
so in at least some in industries uh

196
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,639
notably in the server space we're seeing

197
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,080
emerging requirements for

198
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,560
for ownership transfer so uh in here i

199
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,479
mean like cryptographic ownership so

200
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,400
the ability to reprovision the signing

201
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,520
keys to allow

202
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,960
users to take ownership of those

203
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,639
platforms which would effectively allow

204
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,759
them to be open

205
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,080
um you know we're seeing across many

206
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,960
vendors we're seeing

207
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,000
a big adoption of risk five uh which

208
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,520
even at the lower uh hardware

209
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,280
architectures gives us a

210
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,319
much lower barrier to entry um for for

211
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:16,880
uh

212
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,000
things like advanced security

213
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,319
protections and other novel concepts

214
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,840
and so i guess the question here is well

215
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,199
you know what do you can you share some

216
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,639
thoughts on on the future of open

217
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,080
hardware and firmware

218
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,360
because we do see trends in both

219
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,280
directions

220
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,000
for no reason let's start with axel all

221
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,560
right yeah

222
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,280
um i think probably madness and much

223
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:35,680
more

224
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,400
suitable to to comment on this um but my

225
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:38,880
my

226
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,479
personal view and i'd like to make a

227
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,160
quick disclaimer all my views that i

228
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,000
expressed here today is just my personal

229
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,120
view

230
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,280
nothing to do with my employer fine

231
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,239
friend over same here

232
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,639
and i think i fully agree i i really

233
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,160
like open source highway i used to be

234
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,800
like

235
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,280
i was always for you know open sourcing

236
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,800
everything and

237
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
i as you mentioned i think innovation

238
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,800
starts when more people have access to

239
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,319
it more people have a look at it

240
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,840
so uh and as you mentioned knows the

241
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,440
lower course of entry i think will allow

242
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,599
for a lot of inter innovation

243
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,240
um and because new players will enter um

244
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,440
the established field

245
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,639
and i think it will be fascinating to

246
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,639
see all the innovation that comes here

247
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,039
um i think um there is a small caveat

248
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,720
um and that's about in transparency and

249
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,039
for transparency and so on

250
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,360
i think in transparency so i wouldn't

251
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,080
call it even

252
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,399
security web security but it might be of

253
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,919
the same effect

254
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,839
together with high entry barriers for

255
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,839
attackers can lead to a situation where

256
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:38,839
even product has plenty of

257
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,080
vulnerabilities

258
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,159
relatively infrequently or even never

259
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,159
hacked i mean if you look at automotive

260
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,399
hacking all this stuff is out there in

261
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,160
the 80s campus and so on and

262
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,080
it never had been really got the

263
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,600
attention that it had to

264
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,640
so it can actually also be helpful to

265
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,720
have in transparent systems

266
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,480
i think apple is perceived as probably

267
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,240
one of the most secure

268
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,399
uh products and part of it is that a lot

269
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,800
of people don't have access and can have

270
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,680
understanding of the propriety system

271
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,480
that they have

272
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,040
that's just a hypothesis but i think it

273
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,399
has some submerged

274
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,040
and on the opposite full transparency

275
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,480
which is the right way to do it

276
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,279
eventually as we can see android is

277
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,279
really really highly secure

278
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,959
but it requires all products always to

279
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,720
be patched immediately to the highest

280
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,360
level

281
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,160
and any delay in that patch level will

282
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,839
be immediately exploited by attackers

283
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,440
because they have the same transparency

284
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,080
right

285
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,360
so it shifts eventually the

286
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,360
responsibility to the end users

287
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,600
and whether that is the best choice to

288
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,360
get the highest security level

289
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,760
possible at this stage i'm not really

290
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,800
sure

291
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,480
and i think we need much more awareness

292
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,399
and training for end users and also

293
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,160
better automatic patching

294
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,720
to really reap in the benefits of full

295
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,839
transparency which i

296
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,680
i still believe is there but i think

297
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,120
there could be a situation where we have

298
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,640
that transparency

299
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,959
and then it only plays to the benefit of

300
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,640
the attackers because they're smart

301
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,320
they are driven they have the means and

302
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,920
they know to exploit it and all the end

303
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,279
users who don't

304
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,440
uh you know are not even aware of why

305
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,240
they need to patch it

306
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,320
yeah it is um yeah

307
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,839
sorry assuming you wanted me to go next

308
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:18,000
um

309
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,760
yeah this was this was definitely

310
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,360
something i was very passionate about

311
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,959
especially before i came to intel and i

312
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,360
and i still retain that same passion for

313
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:25,760
it

314
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,680
um and i'll caveat my comments the same

315
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,200
way alex did that

316
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,600
uh the things i say here my own views

317
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,440
and and not necessarily representative

318
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,399
of intel

319
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,760
um but they're

320
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,519
modern processors today i think are far

321
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,160
more complex than people think they are

322
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,760
when you look at a processor today the

323
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,959
last time i counted or received account

324
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,680
the number of microcontrollers and small

325
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,279
processing elements within

326
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,720
a traditional intel or amd processor

327
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,279
is in the thousands so when you buy a

328
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,480
microprocessor

329
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,680
you're talking about a literal network

330
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,480
of systems

331
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,720
within a chip so the ability to open

332
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,680
that up

333
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,160
and allow someone to go in and just make

334
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,600
arbitrary changes

335
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,160
becomes extraordinarily complex if it's

336
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,839
even possible at all

337
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,680
because they never know what unintended

338
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,920
consequences are going to come about

339
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,800
and that's really what's driven i think

340
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,720
probably more than anything

341
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,720
keeping it close is simply to maintain

342
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,000
the functionality

343
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,680
uh people often think that it's a

344
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,279
security aspect i did

345
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,640
before i came to intel that was

346
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,800
absolutely my view on it

347
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,640
since coming here i've i've had my eyes

348
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,560
open a little bit on that so

349
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,320
the questions become what else can we do

350
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,600
to to

351
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
create that transparency to give that

352
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,640
capability to

353
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,399
as you mentioned rob to allow for this

354
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,160
transfer of ownership

355
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,920
uh and i think looking at the industry

356
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,600
right now you're seeing a trend with

357
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,399
creation of smaller route of trust

358
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,200
components

359
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
you see things like the google titan

360
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,440
microsoft cerberus

361
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,880
amazon has their own pluton processor

362
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,680
element

363
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,839
they're creating their own because it's

364
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,360
easier for them to do the security

365
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,560
because they also control the

366
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,680
functionality

367
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,440
and when you control the functionality

368
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,040
and you control the security you can do

369
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,240
a lot of things

370
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,920
trying to partition those out is often

371
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,360
more difficult than you might think it

372
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,240
is

373
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,639
so that i think is probably where we're

374
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,040
seeing the trend move

375
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,120
in the industry is to these small

376
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,959
embedded security elements

377
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,560
within each of the different components

378
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,399
and you'll see specifications i'm

379
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,839
leading one in the trusted computing

380
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:32,639
group right now

381
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,440
the open compute project has

382
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,200
specifications for these platform level

383
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,279
route of trusts these ac root of truss

384
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,160
elements

385
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,320
um having them there and having that

386
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,680
identity

387
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,000
be inside of those smaller components

388
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,600
inside of the larger

389
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,440
connected to the larger system and then

390
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,720
when you want to do that transfer of

391
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,639
ownership you're swapping out

392
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,639
those pieces where they control this

393
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,680
small

394
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,519
microprocessor security element that has

395
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,279
that identity and other information on

396
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,560
it

397
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,320
it's not the only thing that's being

398
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,680
done but that's probably the biggest

399
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,120
trend right now that i'm seeing

400
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,320
nice yeah excellent uh so the next topic

401
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:10,560
is

402
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,760
is kind of a hot one it's been mentioned

403
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,680
a couple of times already today uh the

404
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,600
global chip shortage uh i mean it's no

405
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,040
secret we're in the midst of a global

406
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,480
chip shortage for a number of reasons

407
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,680
droughts and

408
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,440
and and other you know covet obviously

409
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,800
has played a big part of this

410
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,000
um the end result of course is that

411
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,839
we're starting to see like uh lead times

412
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:26,800
up to 24 months

413
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,320
for for some chips and it's causing a

414
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,760
lot of trouble for for anyone who's

415
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,959
designing a product

416
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,760
um so you know we've seen shortages all

417
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,279
from anything from automakers and game

418
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,399
consoles

419
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,079
especially all the high volume products

420
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,839
are definitely affected uh

421
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,160
some oems are are you know buying the

422
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,959
parts first

423
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,320
and then designing the board because

424
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,079
they you know they have they have no

425
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,839
idea if they're by the time they get to

426
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:48,800
ordering if they're going to have the

427
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,160
parts that they intended so

428
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,839
so they're building the product around

429
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,279
the part instead which is kind of

430
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,120
backwards from from typical

431
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,399
um and we're starting to see lots of

432
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,000
predictions about uh things like

433
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,720
counterfeiting

434
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,639
and supply chain concerns uh you know

435
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,000
recyclers are definitely trying to make

436
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,959
a buck and it's

437
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,480
you know the market's ripe for that

438
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,399
right now uh so what are your what are

439
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,000
your thoughts on on these shortages and

440
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,120
what people could do to protect

441
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,160
themselves from

442
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,000
from these sorts of security concerns in

443
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,639
the supply chain

444
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,680
let me start with that this time i guess

445
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,040
i was gonna say i guess i can go first

446
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,760
this time

447
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,959
um so two two items there the the

448
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:23,920
shortage and then

449
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,320
uh what we can do from a counterfeit

450
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,440
standpoint so

451
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,279
the shortage uh obviously one of the

452
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,480
biggest difficulties here with the

453
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,399
shortage is the ability to manufacture

454
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,440
and process these

455
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,040
these ships um with the covid the

456
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,040
the inability of workers to go in

457
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,320
obviously affected it

458
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,320
it also affected it in the explosion of

459
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,920
the need for chips with all the

460
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,519
additional networking capabilities and

461
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,959
things like that to support the video

462
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,639
content

463
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,480
exactly webcams you saw i don't know

464
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,720
about the rest of you but i saw webcam

465
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,760
webcam prices in the 200 300 range at

466
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,800
the early days of the pandemic

467
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
and that's certainly a big part of it

468
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,920
and part

469
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,320
the critical issue there is in the

470
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,639
manufacturing of these products

471
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,920
when you go to a tsmc or to a samsung

472
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,120
who are two of the biggest

473
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,760
open manufacturers on this you have to

474
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,519
put in orders months in advance and

475
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,399
you're putting in

476
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,959
specific orders for a specific amount

477
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,160
and so

478
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,399
when the covet happened and we had this

479
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,560
big boom there wasn't just a way to

480
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,399
immediately inject that in and

481
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,800
boost up the order because it takes time

482
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,920
for a fab

483
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,839
manufacturer to switch over processing

484
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,440
from one processor

485
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,920
family to another to another it's just

486
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,600
not something they can do within

487
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,320
30 minutes type of thing and so then

488
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,680
when you put in your new order well

489
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,040
you're going to the back of the line

490
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,399
after everybody i got to finish all my

491
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,839
other orders before i can even get to

492
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:46,399
you

493
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,160
and so it just created this natural

494
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,759
cascade of delays

495
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,160
in creating stuff that was one of the

496
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,680
key motivations when pat

497
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,079
gelsinger came on at intel in opening up

498
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,480
what we're calling idm 2.0

499
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,720
if you haven't heard about that you can

500
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,160
look up patty's had several news

501
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,680
conferences on that and opening up

502
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,279
intel's manufacturing to be able to

503
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,440
support that to pick up some of the pace

504
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,079
and

505
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,600
and help offload some of that so that

506
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,360
we're manufacturing more than just intel

507
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,399
products we can

508
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,240
manufacture um arm risk etc

509
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,959
to help with this um in terms of the

510
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,160
counterfeiting

511
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,480
yeah this is this is just a breeding

512
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,519
ground for that

513
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,399
um the ability of an attacker to scrape

514
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,240
off the the top layer and re

515
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,240
re-label it as something else the the

516
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,240
ability to decap things i mean we're

517
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,920
seeing all kinds of

518
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,720
crazy things out there in the industry

519
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,240
and yeah it becomes that much more

520
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,079
critical for folks that have a good

521
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,920
understanding of who you're buying this

522
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,320
from

523
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,240
only buying the parts from reputable

524
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,839
vendors from people that you have an

525
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,600
existing relationship with

526
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,639
that you know that these are legitimate

527
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,519
quality intel products or amd products

528
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,680
or arm products whatever it may be

529
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,519
get that certificate of authenticity

530
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,920
from them boot up the part almost

531
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,839
all processors should they have a way to

532
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,199
query

533
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,720
information about them so you need to

534
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,880
verify what you get if you ordered

535
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,480
a certain clock speed if you ordered a

536
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,760
certain number of cores you need to

537
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,640
verify it

538
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,199
when when you get it we can't just a lot

539
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,400
of things that we took for granted

540
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,439
before we can't

541
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,400
anymore that's just the name of the game

542
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,480
was security that's our job every day is

543
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,079
the things we used to take advantage of

544
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,720
we can't do that anymore so

545
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,919
yeah excellent dad yeah i mean i fully

546
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:28,799
agree what matt

547
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,160
just said um i think he he nailed it you

548
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,840
need to buy it from a product resources

549
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,039
that's a trust component um there are

550
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,960
tests that you can do for supply chain

551
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,880
security but they are pricey

552
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,000
and some of them don't scale uh the

553
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,679
really good ones destroy the chip pretty

554
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:46,320
much right

555
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,840
if you know it was the right one then

556
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,919
it's not usable anymore so

557
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,760
it's a scale effect problem so for

558
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,600
certain high security products

559
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,160
i think there are solutions in place to

560
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,480
do specific supply chain testing that

561
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,320
include like you know operational

562
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,559
security aspects logistics aspects

563
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,120
and um also some you know tests at

564
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,720
certain parts along the

565
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,280
uh the life cycle but they're very

566
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,960
pricey and they're certainly not for

567
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,640
every commercial product but probably

568
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,640
more for high security products

569
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,280
and coming back to the supply um

570
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,240
shortages

571
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,160
yeah i mean i think semiconductor

572
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,600
business is cyclical

573
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,440
and and then add to that that we have

574
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,960
this

575
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,039
severe shock um from from covet 19 or

576
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,360
the supply chain disruptions

577
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,480
and then there's something called a

578
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,400
bullwhip effect the further you're away

579
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,919
from the market

580
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,679
the higher this you know it gets

581
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,080
um amplified at every stage of the

582
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,840
supply chain so automotive cars for

583
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,480
example

584
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,160
they have tier one suppliers they have

585
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,080
sub suppliers they have a board board

586
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,039
from somebody and

587
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,120
those guys buy the chips so at every

588
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,559
stage of that supply chain

589
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,640
you amplify the effect and particularly

590
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,080
if you have long lead times

591
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,720
of a demand shock so soon so now they

592
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,520
build up all the

593
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,440
factories in the u.s even in europe that

594
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,880
bring back chip manufacturing which is

595
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,799
great i mean i like to see that

596
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,240
bringing back chip manufacturing all

597
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,000
around the world but

598
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,280
in a few years probably we have a you

599
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,039
know a blood too many things and then

600
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,559
the price collapse and

601
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,039
it's all this very cyclical business and

602
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,880
with this severe shock of covet

603
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,880
and supply chain disruptions this is

604
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,120
really um

605
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,240
another of a problem and i think what is

606
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:24,880
also

607
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,000
what i'd like to add here is the

608
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,880
geopolitical decoupling aspect

609
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,200
so we have this intensifying rivalry

610
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:31,919
between

611
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,480
the us and the west in general and you

612
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,960
know china and other

613
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,600
countries on the other hand and it's

614
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,720
going to be discoupled

615
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,520
so it's happening already some call it

616
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,600
deglobalization but probably we have

617
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,600
two spheres like one that is

618
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,360
china-centric it's all the ecosystem and

619
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,240
all the

620
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,039
supply chains and one that's us central

621
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,320
or western centric

622
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,720
with other supply chains and i think

623
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,840
that doesn't help

624
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,160
on this particular problem as well

625
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,840
because then you have two smaller

626
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,080
spheres that might have supply shortages

627
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,640
or not

628
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,520
interesting okay next topic i was going

629
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,320
to discuss was

630
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,240
around technical debt so all of our

631
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,600
modern ships you know contain

632
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,679
thousands of distinct iv blocks you know

633
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,520
often sourced from external partners and

634
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,720
ip vendors

635
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,400
when vulnerabilities are discovered in

636
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,000
the in those components

637
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,400
um they're often difficult to fix uh you

638
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,200
know if it's

639
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,880
baked into the chip you know if it's a

640
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,640
mask rom or whatnot you know obviously

641
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,720
it can't be patched um if it's firmware

642
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,919
you might be able to get a patch out but

643
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:32,400
even then

644
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,640
i mean patching firmware in the field is

645
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,480
got its own challenges

646
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,919
of course the best move then is to fix

647
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,919
things before you launch uh

648
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,600
and so you know that's just the

649
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,039
accidental bugs

650
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,640
if there's intentional vulnerabilities

651
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,320
trying trying to be inserted into that

652
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,440
supply chain

653
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,280
i mean we've seen this in software space

654
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,039
quite a number of times already uh

655
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,480
especially increasing in the recent

656
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,480
years it's probably only a matter of

657
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,760
time before we start seeing that on the

658
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,799
hardware side

659
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,400
uh so the question here is what what

660
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,919
should silicon vendors be doing to

661
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,679
address that technical debt

662
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,360
of inherited vulnerabilities in their

663
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,960
vendor ip but also

664
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,400
how could they defend against the

665
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,919
intentional ones from supply chain

666
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,320
attacks

667
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,919
let's actually start with you or i don't

668
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,760
care i

669
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,960
no problem um so yeah i mean this is

670
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,080
obviously something that's

671
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,400
that's hot on the presses these days um

672
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,080
anyone who's been paying attention and

673
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,840
and has seen the the issues with the

674
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,200
software supply chain that have been

675
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,000
going on

676
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,080
um if you've seen that then you've got a

677
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,840
it hopefully is leading to you to the

678
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,480
question of

679
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,159
what about the hardware you know a lot

680
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,520
of the same

681
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,760
uh type of attacks that were leveraged

682
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,360
against the software there's really no

683
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,640
reason that they can't be leveraged

684
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,240
against the hardware as well

685
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,720
in terms of the design process and the

686
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,039
build and everything else

687
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,600
it's a very similar from from the you

688
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,720
know the code design

689
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,400
portion up until you actually start

690
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,880
manufacturing so yeah how are we looking

691
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,000
at that and

692
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,039
there's a lot of government work going

693
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,280
on in this area to figure out how we can

694
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,080
address that how can can we put together

695
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,120
bombs

696
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,799
you know we hear about software bombs in

697
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,720
the supply chain what about hardware

698
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,679
bombs can i get

699
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,559
information on everything that went into

700
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,760
this product

701
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,880
what are the constraints and

702
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,640
requirements from a security perspective

703
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,200
that

704
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,440
the larger manufacturers put on the

705
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,240
smaller

706
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,120
vendors that uh when we pull in their ip

707
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,400
or we

708
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,400
take in their device or whatever and we

709
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,240
put it incorporated into our own

710
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,760
what are the security requirements that

711
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,440
they're doing for their product

712
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,960
how do those line up with what we're

713
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,799
doing on our products

714
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,400
and who's responsible for filling the

715
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,919
gap who's idea

716
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,760
responsible for identifying the gaps and

717
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,840
then of course filling the gaps

718
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,600
and it can be very challenging on the

719
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,360
smaller vendors because

720
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,960
as was mentioned here before security

721
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,480
tools often aren't cheap

722
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,559
doing this type of analysis not only is

723
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,120
it expensive from the licensing

724
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,480
standpoint of the tools

725
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,480
but also the time the commitment the

726
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,919
overhead

727
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,400
security just plain and simply isn't

728
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,400
cheap if it was cheap security would be

729
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,080
everywhere we all know that

730
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,200
but it's not so they have difficulty in

731
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,720
the larger manufacturers

732
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,880
it you know falls on them to help a

733
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,720
little bit to to work together

734
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,360
in the industry to lift one another up

735
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,360
when we're lifting the security of

736
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,440
of a smaller vendor than that we're

737
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,039
using in our product and ultimately

738
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:27,840
we're

739
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,799
lifting our own security um so working

740
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,240
together with the vendors

741
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,000
coming up with comprehensive plans and

742
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,760
of course working on standards

743
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,520
where we have that information and we

744
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,840
can design things to certain standards

745
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,360
have certain security protocols and

746
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,559
stuff like that that we're

747
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,760
taking to make sure that the designs are

748
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,440
the integrity is as strong as we can

749
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,799
make it

750
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,960
that it gets successfully from one place

751
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,200
to another and when it gets put into

752
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,279
an intel chip an amd chip an arm chip

753
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,360
whatever that it is exactly what that

754
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,799
designer manufactured

755
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,559
because as you mentioned what about

756
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,159
these hardware bikes what about someone

757
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,840
inserting something in there a malicious

758
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,840
insider or something like that

759
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,400
the government's moving to a uh to a

760
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,640
zero trust architecture

761
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,320
maybe that's easy to do in the public

762
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,679
sector world where

763
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,600
everyone just kind of builds on security

764
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,080
but going in the private sector

765
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,600
how do you go to your employees and you

766
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,360
say i don't trust you

767
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,200
so you're going to give me everything

768
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,640
and then i'm going to re-verify it

769
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,240
because i don't trust you and i'm not

770
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,760
going to trust you until i'm done

771
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,640
verifying it

772
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,880
that just doesn't work well with morale

773
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,480
so how do we

774
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,279
in the private sector put together a

775
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:35,679
zero

776
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,600
trust type of architecture to be able to

777
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,880
support what

778
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,880
public sectors and other organizations

779
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,039
are doing that becomes i think for me

780
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,120
one of the next big challenges of how we

781
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,520
integrate those two things together and

782
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,279
how do we build that up because if we

783
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,000
don't

784
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,440
then you're absolutely right we're

785
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,159
opening ourselves up to injection

786
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,679
in products we're opening ourselves up

787
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,440
to malicious alteration and things like

788
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,720
that and that becomes

789
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,960
very scary because it's very difficult

790
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,799
to fix those type of things in the field

791
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,919
yeah i fully agree with what matt said

792
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:08,960
zero trust

793
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,840
i think i like what um ronald reagan's

794
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,880
trust.verify i think that's what you

795
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,720
need to do but exactly as mercy pointed

796
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,159
out this as a

797
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:19,919
big issue on morale and others and also

798
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,760
economic impact that it's not

799
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,279
feasible for most of the products i

800
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,360
would say it could work for high

801
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,400
security government

802
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,760
solution products but i think to

803
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,200
really prevent against these

804
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,320
nation state actors

805
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,120
that's really really pricey i don't know

806
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,159
if that's really the

807
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,520
biggest challenge uh or whether it's

808
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,480
already good to

809
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,960
you know secure against criminals and

810
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,480
script kitties and so on

811
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,200
which we already struggled to do um but

812
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,080
yeah

813
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,840
and coming back to what the window

814
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,240
should do i think most of the

815
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,200
vulnerabilities even the really nasty

816
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,159
and hardware

817
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,080
can be mitigated by one way or another

818
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,360
with software

819
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,039
uh and usually it comes at a heavy

820
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,080
performance and usability cost

821
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,679
but in the end you can mitigate pretty

822
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,200
much everything if you're willing to

823
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,080
give up 30

824
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,840
performance and you know i don't know a

825
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,360
lot of uh

826
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,320
software memory space but i think what

827
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,080
the vendors really need to do is

828
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,120
they need to invest much more effort

829
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,240
and manpower in handling

830
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,919
patches and developing proper patches

831
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,799
and they should at least write easy to

832
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,400
understand white papers that explain

833
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,200
both the

834
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,720
vulnerability and how the mitigation

835
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,039
works so that others understand the

836
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,360
limitations of the mitigations i think

837
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,039
they should provide well-engineered

838
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:43,760
performance

839
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,360
optimized patches not something that is

840
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,039
quickly out the door but something that

841
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,039
is really a good piece of software

842
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,480
for the next layout stack and they

843
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,679
should work with those people on the

844
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:52,880
next layoff stack

845
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,720
so that they can easily integrate in the

846
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,559
next software update then as well

847
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,080
and ideally the patches could have

848
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,919
different optimization goals low power

849
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,919
low energy low code size low latency

850
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,840
high throughput whatever so that you

851
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,919
know potentially with a compile switch

852
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:07,600
you might be able to

853
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,200
uh um integrate it then further up

854
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,200
and i think the benefit then is because

855
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,960
then it becomes really really expensive

856
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,720
to do a proper job in

857
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,039
patching the mess that you have created

858
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,080
pretty much

859
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,240
then it probably becomes easier to

860
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,200
justify

861
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,000
upfront security cost in-house to do

862
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,120
your homework to do a

863
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,480
better job in in designing the product

864
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,399
but it will never be the case that you

865
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,559
know security by design is an oxymoron

866
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,440
it's not possible because

867
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,360
the attacks come up new techniques and

868
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,880
it never be possible so you always have

869
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,919
a situation but

870
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,799
it still helps i think um to have these

871
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:43,440
costs

872
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,360
because then you can have more cost

873
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,520
justified to build a secure product in

874
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,760
the beginning

875
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,159
okay the last question i had is really

876
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,840
open-ended uh you know we've seen a lot

877
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,919
of uh micro architectural attacks you

878
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:56,559
know specter

879
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,399
meltdown and subsequently you know

880
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,720
dozens more like that every time there's

881
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,720
a shared resource on the chip there

882
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,399
tends to be a side channel there

883
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,240
uh it doesn't seem to be much way around

884
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,840
that other than just not running

885
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,600
third party code which just frankly

886
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,520
doesn't work in a browser-based world

887
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,279
uh so i guess where do you think where

888
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,640
is all going next where do you think the

889
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,000
next big areas for security

890
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,200
research you're going to be on both the

891
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,279
offensive and defensive side

892
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:23,279
let me start without axel here i think

893
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,559
for the defensive side it's probably

894
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,480
integrating existing solutions properly

895
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,240
from hardware and firmware over kermit

896
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,679
huddling all the way to containers and

897
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,120
so on

898
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,080
to to make secure products um i don't

899
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,520
know if you know how involved these kind

900
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,000
of things

901
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,480
i really like um and i think also

902
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,640
leveraging attack tools or methods for

903
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,760
defense purposes is a nice thing you can

904
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,159
use side channels for ip watermarking

905
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,360
for example uh these kind of things um

906
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,200
but like and i think automatic patch

907
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,200
management is really really important

908
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,120
and needs some some research on the

909
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,720
offensive sides um

910
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,440
might be my passion but i think uefi and

911
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,360
ring minus 3 and so on all down there i

912
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,000
think this is

913
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,159
really really interesting breeding

914
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:07,440
ground to

915
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,720
to work and fix vulnerabilities and in

916
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,159
general i think

917
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,240
reverse engineering any proprietary

918
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,840
hardware security features

919
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,080
such as fuse layouts or bitstream

920
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,000
encodings for fpgas

921
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,200
that's something too much of the

922
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,399
trust relies upon and i i don't want to

923
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,720
see somebody at some point having the

924
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,720
fpga bit stream encoding suddenly

925
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,399
reverse engineered and then you can you

926
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:33,520
know

927
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,159
break the weak encryption and suddenly

928
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:37,679
have all the designs and then a lot of

929
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:38,840
the trust model

930
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,120
collapses and similarly with fuse

931
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,720
layouts

932
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,000
this is for me too much uh

933
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,640
responsibility with um too little

934
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,080
transparency pretty much

935
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,240
i think reverse engineering any property

936
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,159
hardware security feature is

937
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,480
is um really really interesting

938
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,480
yeah i um i kind of feel the same way i

939
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,720
as you know as axel said he you know he

940
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,559
was talking about going down the uefi

941
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:07,120
level

942
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,600
we've seen attackers go from the

943
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,760
application to the os level to the

944
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,720
hypervisor level to the uefi level

945
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,399
what's next well the hardware

946
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,080
the hardware is the next thing in in

947
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,320
line on that and i do think that that's

948
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,039
where

949
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,559
the next primary focus of research and

950
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,600
security issues are going to be we

951
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,120
talked earlier about hardware

952
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,960
trojans we talked about hardware

953
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,640
insertion of malicious things into

954
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,840
hardware

955
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,600
i think that from my perspective that's

956
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,360
the thing i'm the most worried about

957
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,559
right now just in general um we know

958
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,320
that attackers are going lower and lower

959
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,240
that just seems like the natural place

960
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,360
we've seen the the

961
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,600
software supply chain issues that have

962
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,960
come about over the last couple of

963
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,840
months we only expect that to get bigger

964
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,520
and we've got to assume this is going to

965
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,720
it's going to move into the hardware

966
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,799
side as well so what are we doing

967
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,880
as an industry on the hardware side to

968
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,000
to look into that and

969
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,880
and find potential issues which is why

970
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,279
you ask a question rob

971
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,559
and then from the uh defensive side of

972
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:09,840
the house

973
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,760
for me i i still think it's it's going

974
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,519
to be modularization of security

975
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,279
capabilities it's going to be security

976
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,399
as a service

977
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,320
uh technologies we're looking at the

978
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,399
platform root of trust we're looking at

979
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,799
pulling trust into isolated execution

980
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,240
environments one of the biggest issues

981
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,279
right now

982
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,600
when an attacker attacks a system and

983
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,279
they gain execution on the operating

984
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,200
system they're attacking the same system

985
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,640
that has the security that's

986
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,120
implementing the security

987
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,799
we just can't do that you've got to be

988
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,720
able to isolate the security away from

989
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,559
the normal execution environment so that

990
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,279
when

991
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,039
an attacker gains execution in your

992
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,640
standard operating system

993
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,399
he does he or she does not have the

994
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:47,840
ability to

995
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,440
to then manipulate the security of the

996
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,840
system the security needs to be pristine

997
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,039
it needs to be running it needs to

998
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,799
always be checking for those things

999
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:55,919
and if it's running in the same

1000
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,039
environment that the hacker can

1001
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,000
potentially get into

1002
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,240
that's a problem so i think we're going

1003
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,840
to start seeing a lot of

1004
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,399
security being pulled out of the os

1005
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,080
pulled into these smaller

1006
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,240
uh platform root of trust elements ac

1007
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,440
root of trust elements

1008
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,440
things like that executing out of band

1009
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,200
but with introspection

1010
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,600
into the traditional running operating

1011
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,399
system

1012
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,240
and i think as you see that you also see

1013
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,919
an expansion of security as a service

1014
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,360
capabilities you're going to see all

1015
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,880
kind of new frameworks and things like

1016
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,760
that for

1017
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,760
for running security on systems with

1018
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,159
separated security elements that are

1019
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:31,919
doing that introspection and continually

1020
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,919
monitoring the security of the system

1021
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,000
but doing so from a separate execution

1022
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,159
environment i really think that from my

1023
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:39,919
perspective is where on the defensive

1024
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:40,640
side

1025
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,559
we really need to be looking and we i

1026
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,080
think we really are looking and starting

1027
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:44,960
to right now

1028
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,159
uh to build that up and make that happen

1029
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,399
nice very good uh so at this point i

1030
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:51,440
guess there's a couple of questions in

1031
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,080
the chat

1032
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,120
um just ask those here uh first one here

1033
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,159
is i missed the part

1034
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:57,679
where matt was talking about thousands

1035
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,519
of processors in a computer uh could you

1036
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,080
elaborate

1037
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,919
on that i think maybe it was the scale

1038
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,679
of the number of uh microcontrollers

1039
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:04,559
that uh probably

1040
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,760
oh i'm off guard yeah so uh this this

1041
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,279
actually caught me off guard

1042
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,640
um but my boss when i when i first came

1043
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,320
after being at intel for the first

1044
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,000
couple months he gave me a presentation

1045
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,559
and

1046
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,960
one of his slides in the presentation it

1047
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,000
was talking about the number of

1048
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,360
microcontrollers

1049
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,159
and small computing elements inside of a

1050
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,200
single

1051
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,000
uh processor and that is now you know

1052
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,279
what used to be

1053
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,559
you know 1 5 10 20

1054
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,440
is now turning into thousands so all the

1055
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,720
different functionalities and

1056
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,320
capabilities and things like that that

1057
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,519
you might look at all the different

1058
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,360
interconnects the bus

1059
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,000
level translators things like that a lot

1060
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,039
of those things now

1061
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,159
run on small microcontrollers

1062
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,440
on there that actually have their own

1063
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,039
code base and stuff like that that are

1064
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,240
running

1065
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,440
so as a result what looks like you know

1066
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,279
for instance an eight-core intel

1067
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:58,720
processor

1068
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,840
is actually an entire network of

1069
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,760
microcontrollers and processing elements

1070
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,360
all within a single chip

1071
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,279
with those eight cores just being the

1072
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,359
biggest processing thing on there

1073
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,760
so it really it was fascinating to me i

1074
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,760
think it uh probably fascinating to most

1075
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,320
people as well

1076
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,639
the next question was should the u.s

1077
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,560
reduce dependency of chip manufacturing

1078
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,199
and focus

1079
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:24,239
more on in inland manufacturing um

1080
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,440
and i think we covered this a little bit

1081
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,679
as well right um actually you you're

1082
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,040
commenting about how

1083
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,440
how there's a decoupling going on did

1084
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,599
you elaborate on that at

1085
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,879
sure i mean i think chips are strategic

1086
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,199
right so and the u.s still has a large

1087
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,719
ship manufacturer with intel

1088
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,440
having lots of faps still in the u.s

1089
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,560
plenty of apps and i think there's

1090
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,359
another

1091
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,000
40 plus billion dollars being spent now

1092
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,719
on

1093
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,520
traditional ship manufacturing uh

1094
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,199
capabilities in the u.s so yeah i mean

1095
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,239
they have it we you

1096
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,000
i'm from germany and we used to have

1097
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,920
chip manufacturing capabilities

1098
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,880
amd was there and uh siemens i think

1099
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,160
they're also talking about bringing

1100
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,280
something back

1101
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,480
to to germany um it

1102
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,280
certainly reduces dependability on

1103
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,040
other states so from a strategic

1104
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,839
perspective i think

1105
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,640
it is important to do that it's just a

1106
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,400
question of the economics if they can

1107
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,440
get it to work

1108
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,839
well that makes sense and whenever the

1109
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,079
government has to subsidize something

1110
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,800
it screws the market and then you know

1111
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,119
it's

1112
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,960
it's a bit like coal right coal mining

1113
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,880
was subsidized everywhere for a long

1114
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,359
time

1115
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,880
because it was a strategic resource um

1116
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,680
and now chips are the same right so how

1117
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,240
long

1118
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,480
should we subsidize or where where

1119
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,480
should the balance be taken and this is

1120
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,040
clearly a political decision so

1121
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,160
i can't really comment on that

1122
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,760
cool uh how are manufacturers handling

1123
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,599
the feature size limitations especially

1124
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,200
now that we're reaching the atomic level

1125
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,598
sizes

1126
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,920
um well as you can see i

1127
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,440
think that would would probably be

1128
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,960
directed to me and unfortunately i'm the

1129
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,480
wrong person to answer it

1130
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,680
um on behalf of intel uh i'm just

1131
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,200
i'm not the hardware designer i'm a

1132
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,280
security security person

1133
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,240
um but i do know yeah we are getting

1134
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,680
down we're getting down to

1135
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,720
uh you know intel processing we're you

1136
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,119
know

1137
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,960
10 nanometer in our latest chip seven

1138
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,960
nanometer we're working on as well

1139
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,520
um trying to get down like tsmc at the

1140
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,599
glass was reported at five nanometer or

1141
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,280
three nanometer even

1142
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,200
how much lower can we go it's it's a

1143
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,400
good question and

1144
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,359
the physics behind that how the the uh

1145
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:42,960
move to finfet and

1146
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,640
uh changing the way the transistors work

1147
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,320
obviously is uh

1148
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,160
helping us air to go smaller and smaller

1149
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,079
but how much smaller

1150
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,839
smaller can we go and we just don't know

1151
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,839
and so yeah from that perspective i

1152
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:54,480
think

1153
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,440
um it then becomes an issue of what

1154
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,400
about stacking

1155
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,520
what about 3d uh layering on the on the

1156
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,680
processors and things like that

1157
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,680
intel intel for instance has the

1158
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,119
furveros technology

1159
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,880
that we use on a few of our processors

1160
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,960
to be able to stack things into a full

1161
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,640
system on a chip

1162
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,839
technology and i think that's

1163
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,359
probably i'm just guessing here again

1164
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,440
this is just my opinion

1165
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,800
probably the next avenue that we're

1166
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,800
going to go down on that

1167
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,240
obviously we're you know you're still

1168
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,079
trying to shrink the the

1169
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:29,359
transistors down as small as you can but

1170
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:30,800
to whatever limit you get to you've got

1171
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,200
to start looking at other options so

1172
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,920
3d stack at least some some companies

1173
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,599
are even going wider there's a number of

1174
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:38,960
companies looking at wafer scale

1175
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,480
where they're they're putting you know

1176
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,640
eight hundred thousand cores on the same

1177
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,680
you know four inch sorry 18 inch platter

1178
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,480
or whatever

1179
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,359
um so just pushing physics in all

1180
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:50,560
different directions

1181
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,520
yep uh the next question here was about

1182
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:53,760
the

1183
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,680
right to repair how do you support right

1184
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,280
to repair this is

1185
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,040
relates to a first topic we talked about

1186
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,640
open hardware a little bit

1187
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,920
um i don't know if anyone wants to take

1188
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,560
a stab at that one

1189
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,960
uh so i mean i'm i'm certainly a fan of

1190
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,079
it um

1191
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,400
now there's obviously there's security

1192
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,359
implications

1193
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,359
to that and that becomes a big question

1194
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:16,880
is how do you handle handle the security

1195
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,240
questions

1196
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,960
there's also legal ramifications whether

1197
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,640
we like it or not we live in a world

1198
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,720
where there's legal ramifications and if

1199
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,560
you just open it up well who's liable

1200
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,440
at that point in time and i think you

1201
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,720
know for better for worse

1202
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,400
that ends up being a driving factor more

1203
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,079
than anything else

1204
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,520
the security we could work around i

1205
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,280
think we are we're

1206
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,119
as an industry we're looking at at the

1207
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,200
way to do this how can we

1208
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,680
take what used to be hard coded into

1209
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,280
fuses or something like that

1210
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,960
in the processors how can we put it into

1211
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,880
something that's rewritable so that you

1212
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,720
can transfer ownership you can

1213
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,200
unlock the part uh things like that that

1214
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,599
you can do this right to repair

1215
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,760
on that because you know one of the

1216
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,160
analogies i use with security is

1217
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,440
designing security is like

1218
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,599
packing a bag for someone when you don't

1219
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,119
know where they're going

1220
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,640
what they're doing or how long they'll

1221
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,480
be there

1222
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,880
you as the end customer you know where

1223
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,400
you're putting your product you know

1224
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,160
what you're using it for and you know

1225
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,160
how long you expect it to be there

1226
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,520
so why aren't you doing the security on

1227
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,960
the product

1228
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,800
why are we doing it for you type of

1229
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,960
thing so that does become a question the

1230
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,440
best way to address that is to have a

1231
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,040
right to repair type of

1232
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,079
mentality an open source security

1233
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,680
solution

1234
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,839
things like that where you're giving

1235
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,920
individuals the ability to customize the

1236
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,359
security for them so that's certainly

1237
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:40,800
something that's being researched

1238
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,920
and looked into and we'll just have to

1239
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,640
be patient

1240
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,079
unfortunately and see what happens with

1241
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,160
it

1242
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,400
uh and the last comment i'm seeing here

1243
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,599
uh

1244
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:52,640
following up on the right to repair

1245
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,839
arguments do you think that there's a

1246
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:55,760
way to encourage vendors to unlock

1247
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,079
end of life devices that will no longer

1248
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:58,960
receive updates

1249
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,720
uh unlocking boot loaders releasing keys

1250
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,480
etc would you be

1251
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,640
it would it be nice to see an optional

1252
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,079
update for end of

1253
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,560
end of for end users that want to

1254
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,920
repurpose the hardware and prevent them

1255
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,920
from ending up in a landfill

1256
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,920
uh axel you wanna you wanna take that

1257
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,119
one oh yeah i mean

1258
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,599
i i i'm fully lined with what math said

1259
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:18,640
i also like

1260
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,800
right repair open source i'm fully on

1261
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,480
board with that

1262
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,200
but i similarly i see um legal

1263
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,040
challenges um

1264
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,160
liability issues uh and economic impact

1265
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,920
if suddenly you open up

1266
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,920
something and severe vulnerability is

1267
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,440
found then

1268
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,560
inside the company somebody will be uh

1269
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,200
punished for that i guess so and and

1270
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,800
then it needs to be fixed and

1271
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,640
sometimes it has impact on stock prices

1272
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,319
and so on so forth so people will always

1273
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,599
try to cover

1274
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,800
their backs before they do that

1275
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,119
so i think it's um um it's nice to

1276
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,800
i like the idea that was posted in the

1277
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,480
chat here that once prior to the end of

1278
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,079
life and pretty much there's no more

1279
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,119
money to be made by it if then it's like

1280
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:03,599
um

1281
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,520
given to the greater good because

1282
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,280
usually these products are still

1283
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,800
valid for other use cases then

1284
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,599
yeah someone posted an example here the

1285
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,280
microchip battery monitor chips

1286
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,920
for automotive support second life so

1287
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,599
they can be used for

1288
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,920
used auto ev battery can be repurposed

1289
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,040
as a whole home battery

1290
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,119
uh it's interesting so it might not be

1291
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,720
appropriate for vehicles anymore but

1292
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,920
it's using a more stationary application

1293
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,280
does anyone else have any questions that

1294
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,839
they want to ask

1295
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,079
rob there's one question no i think

1296
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,920
that's the last one that's the about the

1297
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,200
microchip battery monitor

1298
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,960
uh i that was one i just read i don't

1299
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,680
think it was a question

1300
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,720
it was more of a comment okay great

1301
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,000
uh i think that's it for now

1302
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,240
uh yeah i think we'll skip this question

1303
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,960
because we're running out of time uh

1304
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,240
so thank you rob axel uh matt this was

1305
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,040
amazing

1306
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,560
i'm not sure if you guys saw but you

1307
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,480
also had your entire panel

1308
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,599
drawn uh as well uh so

1309
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,520
i will send it yeah i send it to you

1310
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,800
guys after the

1311
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,200
conference uh it's going to be amazing

1312
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,720
and looks pretty as well

1313
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,280
so friends uh from the audience also i

1314
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,400
hope you guys like it

1315
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,839
if i would like to reach out to this

1316
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:27,200
artist let us know we'll happy to

1317
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,079
connect you

1318
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:31,760
uh yeah can you please put it back on it

1319
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,920
because i really like matthew's analogy

1320
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,680
to packing your bag for somebody else

1321
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,359
going on vacation not knowing when and

1322
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:37,760
how

1323
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,800
because this is really this dixie uh i

1324
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,400
really like to see a back on that to

1325
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,640
remind you mean a backpack

1326
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,560
yeah okay okay

1327
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,040
all right uh aston when you draw the

1328
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,720
backpack right hardware on io

1329
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,660
there

1330
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:56,560
[Laughter]

1331
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,880
yeah all right i've never had i've never

1332
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,480
had anyone live drawing the

1333
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,560
talk before it was kind of cool yeah it

1334
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,920
feels great

1335
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,960
yeah we did this we did did this

1336
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,280
for both the keynotes and for the

1337
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,599
closing panel uh from you guys so i hope

1338
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:13,520
uh you guys liked it and

1339
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,520
i'll share with you guys a printed copy

1340
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,800
as well uh

1341
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,839
once i have your postal address thank

1342
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:20,800
you

1343
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:27,839
sure all right thank you so much

1344
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,880
you
