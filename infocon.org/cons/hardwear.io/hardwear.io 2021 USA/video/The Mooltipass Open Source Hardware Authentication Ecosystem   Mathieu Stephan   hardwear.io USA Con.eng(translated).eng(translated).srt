00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,400
uh thank you so much for joining us uh

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,840
friends matthew is an electronic

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,560
engineer

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,640
and he'll be presenting uh i like the

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,680
way he's uh

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,480
titled the name multi-pass open source

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,080
hardware authentication

13
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,199
uh framework providing uh

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,000
it's completely open source and uh

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,640
matthew

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,440
uh i wouldn't want to delay your time so

17
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,239
you could start

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,520
your presentation okay thank you for the

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,680
introduction uh it was a very short

20
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,120
introduction but i didn't want to delay

21
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,239
the time yeah

22
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,520
it's fine don't worry i'll make an

23
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,760
introduction as well as

24
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,680
i'm going to interrupt your screen

25
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,920
sharing so i can share mine

26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,680
yes so this you should be able to see my

27
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,320
screen now

28
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,359
great uh thanks everyone for joining so

29
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,559
uh this um so this talk is gonna be

30
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:05,760
about the multipass

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,080
uh so i'll actually have a slide where i

32
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,280
present myself

33
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,159
uh so i'm embedded systems engineer like

34
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,920
other speakers at hardware

35
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,200
i was also um i was also a writer for

36
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,640
hackaday.com

37
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,680
i have some blog where you can see a few

38
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,799
uh like projects i do during my spare

39
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,479
time and i'm the multi-pass project

40
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,479
founder

41
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,000
so what is the multipass ecosystem

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,840
the multipass ecosystem is

43
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,000
a complete ecosystem based around some

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,360
hard devices

45
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,240
and this ecosystem aims at allowing you

46
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,680
to store credentials

47
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,439
small nodes files it also allows you to

48
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,399
authenticate

49
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,520
on ssh servers

50
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,920
also allows you to authenticate using a

51
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,119
web button so

52
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,280
i'll so the different points i'm

53
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,200
actually presenting here i would refer

54
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,600
uh i will refer to them a bit later

55
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,280
during the presentation

56
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,640
so web button it shows it's a

57
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,840
password-less authentication technique

58
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,560
uh

59
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,680
it we also support time-based one-time

60
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,720
passwords

61
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,920
uh the devices allow multiple users

62
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,040
multiple users can use the devices that

63
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,239
we offer the devices can be used on

64
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,160
multiple platforms maybe

65
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,520
linux computers mac os windows

66
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,200
smartphones ios android um

67
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,319
we also provide some extensions to

68
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,840
allow native credentials recall uh in

69
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,080
your favorite websites and the complete

70
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,080
ecosystem is actually open source

71
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,280
uh me open source software and open open

72
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,280
source hardware so all

73
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,959
the design files for the hardware

74
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,400
devices for

75
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,319
the extensions for the software

76
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,440
everything is online

77
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,879
i'll give the link at the end of the

78
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,120
presentation

79
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,599
so i was as i was saying the complete

80
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,879
system

81
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,720
is open source we have contributors from

82
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,159
all over the globe so this is

83
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,200
a quick world map of the

84
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,040
interesting locations of our

85
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,040
contributors

86
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,360
so going back to the multipass ecosystem

87
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,560
so as i was

88
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,080
saying before the multiplayer ecosystem

89
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,879
is based about

90
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,239
uh is based around devices

91
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,319
uh so on the bottom i'm not sure if you

92
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,599
can see my pointer

93
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,680
i don't think so so i will give

94
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,640
locations

95
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,640
so on the bottom of this slide you see

96
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,239
one of our devices

97
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,360
this device may be connected to your

98
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,680
computer smartphone using usb or

99
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,400
bluetooth

100
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,599
so we present different communication

101
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,799
channels

102
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,920
some of them are hid which is an acronym

103
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,560
for human

104
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,120
interface device device that means that

105
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,239
when you connect your

106
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,080
your device to your computer it doesn't

107
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,799
require any driver

108
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,239
it doesn't require any special

109
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,840
permissions i know for example that some

110
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,599
companies actually have some very strong

111
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,120
restrictions about the kind of hardware

112
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,640
you can connect to your to the

113
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,120
to the computers so this is basically

114
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,480
recognized as a keyboard

115
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,080
so we have different communication

116
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,840
channels that basically

117
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,159
facilitates um the way for you to

118
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,720
authenticate onto websites so using

119
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,160
login passwords

120
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,160
uh we provide some uh tools to actually

121
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,240
log into ssh servers using ssh agents

122
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,720
we as i was previously referring to we

123
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,440
have uh

124
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,840
passwordless webathon supports

125
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,479
which is basically a public private key

126
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,320
authentication system i will refer to it

127
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,759
later

128
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,919
and we have a few software frameworks

129
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,520
that if you don't want to

130
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,160
if you if you want to actually script

131
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,120
the way you

132
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,280
interact with the device uh this would

133
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,240
be a good

134
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,000
starting point so going from

135
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,320
nice icons into actually words so this

136
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,759
is the these are the different

137
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,600
uh elements uh that uh we provide maybe

138
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,400
software

139
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,440
or hardware uh so i will

140
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,520
start discussing about the hardware side

141
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,440
of things so the

142
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,560
hardware devices so the multipass

143
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,520
project actually has been going on uh

144
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,199
for the last seven

145
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,479
eight years something like that it

146
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,759
originally started as

147
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:25,280
hackaday.com sponsored community

148
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,840
project so there was a call for

149
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,520
contributors and

150
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,120
seems the idea of offline password-based

151
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,000
password keeper was quite interesting to

152
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,639
some people

153
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,759
and from there it spawned into a lot

154
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,680
more as you will be able to see later

155
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,840
so from seven years ago we actually

156
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,240
created three different devices

157
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,120
uh so you can see the evolution from big

158
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,759
one which

159
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,600
was a bit more aimed at desktops into

160
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,280
something that is a bit more portable

161
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,000
especially

162
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,800
uh one that provides bluetooth which is

163
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,479
completely standalone you don't need

164
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:01,759
the device to be connected to your

165
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,680
computer to uh

166
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,759
for example display logins and passwords

167
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,560
so this the complete security model of

168
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,160
the multi-pass devices

169
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,680
is the aim to be tampered evident so the

170
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,360
devices are made in aluminum and we

171
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,280
designed them in such a way that any

172
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,400
attempt at

173
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,319
uh getting into the insides would lead

174
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,000
into visible marks

175
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,840
uh so here you can actually see a slide

176
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,759
of me trying to

177
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,280
see what kind of uh how resistance or

178
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,400
how temper evident

179
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,840
actually our case would be

180
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,960
i'm going to then concentrate into uh

181
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,280
talk a bit more about our latest device

182
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,680
uh so this device so this is the

183
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,520
multipass mini ble

184
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,520
it is a device that we have been working

185
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,599
on for the last uh

186
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,039
four years five years something like

187
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,440
that and basically it was

188
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,759
given that it is a contributor-based

189
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,560
project

190
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,759
we had a lot of time if i may say so to

191
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,800
actually work on it

192
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,520
and actually to develop something that

193
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,120
we really wanted to

194
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,319
uh to provide to anyone while being open

195
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:10,800
source

196
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,680
uh so for this device we actually

197
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,000
inserted two microcontrollers into them

198
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,800
uh so on the multipassbp you have one

199
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,319
microcontroller that you can

200
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,479
the secure one basically which is only

201
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,000
dedicated at storing

202
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,720
doing all the security or the sensitive

203
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,440
operations

204
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,960
it is the one who is going to decrypt

205
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,199
your credentials the one that is going

206
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,880
to display information on the screen the

207
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,160
one that is going to display all the

208
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,199
information

209
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,880
and you have a non-secure

210
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,280
microcontroller which is just

211
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,520
a term to say it is the microcontroller

212
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,120
that is going to deal with the outside

213
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,599
world

214
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,240
it is the one that is going to interface

215
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,680
with your computer

216
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,520
using bluetooth or usb uh it is the one

217
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,840
that is the most exposed but it is not

218
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,720
the one that

219
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,000
we on which the complete security of the

220
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,400
device relies on

221
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,639
expanding a bit more to that so there is

222
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,639
one microcontroller that is dedicated to

223
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,520
the

224
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,840
secure operation the decryption of the

225
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,919
credentials

226
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,319
displaying information on the on the led

227
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,360
display

228
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,960
and there is the other one that is

229
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,599
dedicated to the outside communications

230
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,759
and the communications between uh the

231
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,440
two microcontrollers is really

232
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,000
old-school

233
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,280
is like a serial link with a fixed frame

234
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,720
uh with just okay a given message type

235
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,479
okay please give me the credential for

236
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,680
that particular website

237
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,719
one of the numerous examples uh so as i

238
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,240
was saying the goal is that

239
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,599
all the protocol stacks uh maybe usb

240
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,399
or bluetooth if um i'm pretty sure that

241
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,000
if you follow the recent news like

242
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,760
there is always a new bug or some

243
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,920
interesting valuability that is found

244
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,200
uh into the the the bluetooth stacks so

245
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,560
here basically all

246
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,760
the protocol stacks and all the complex

247
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,760
libraries are directly offloaded into

248
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,240
the non-secure microcontroller so this

249
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,959
this allows us to make sure that if it

250
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,320
is compromised

251
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,160
then it is not going to compromise all

252
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,680
your credentials it's really something

253
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,680
that is set apart and like

254
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,480
and minimizing the interactions with the

255
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,160
most secure microcontroller

256
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,320
it makes things complex but makes them

257
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,519
interesting as well

258
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,279
so actually what what it actually looks

259
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,200
like so you have

260
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,640
uh the the user uh that wants to

261
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,880
announce its credential database that is

262
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,680
going to insert

263
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,519
its pin onto the second controller

264
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,959
using the scroll wheel this pin code so

265
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,959
we have a way of authenticating the

266
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,000
smart card

267
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,120
that we can go back to it later

268
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,120
so it's going to insert its pin code and

269
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,800
to the second microcontroller

270
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,600
this pin code is going to be sent to a

271
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,279
smart card that contains the

272
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,720
encryption key as 156 this encryption

273
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,680
key is going to be

274
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,200
sent once the pin is validated this is

275
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,320
going to be sent to the secure

276
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,480
microcontroller that can then

277
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,360
decrypt the credentials of said user and

278
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,800
after

279
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,800
using usb or bluetooth these

280
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,640
auxiliary microcontroller will be able

281
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,880
to query the secure microcontroller for

282
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,320
the credentials the

283
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,680
user will be prompted for approval or be

284
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,560
notified

285
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,200
depending on the user preference

286
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,399
microcontrollers

287
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,920
so there are of the shelf they are from

288
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,040
atmel or now microchip this

289
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,399
internally store the unique encryption

290
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,720
and signing keys per device so that

291
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,000
means for each

292
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,800
device for each microcontroller we have

293
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,240
a unique

294
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,120
encryption key that allows to send

295
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,640
custom

296
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,600
update files so if for example one

297
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,040
encryption key is compromised on one

298
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,279
device it doesn't compromise the rest of

299
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,600
the the park or the rest of the other

300
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,800
devices

301
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,079
and the device themselves can be updated

302
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,519
using uniquely sign phone updates

303
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,480
so one may wonder actually how uh how we

304
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,200
actually flash

305
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,000
these microcontrollers with the unique

306
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,600
encryption keys

307
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,600
we actually do it ourselves we designed

308
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,760
our own custom-made programming jig

309
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,399
so for a few days we actually take the

310
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,320
microcontrollers one by one put them on

311
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:22,800
the

312
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,880
on the programming slots and we have

313
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,040
everything programmed

314
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,079
quite fun and some fun days um

315
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,279
so now i'm going to uh to speak a bit

316
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,399
more about the

317
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,200
uh the the firmware features that we

318
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,240
provide

319
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,640
um

320
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,360
[Music]

321
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,480
so ies encryptions so the saying the

322
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,360
good saying goes that you don't roll out

323
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,000
your own

324
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,880
cryptographic routines we didn't of

325
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,440
course

326
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,959
so we are using bear ssl in counter mode

327
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,560
the uh grand contact with the creator of

328
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,279
the library

329
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,480
uh who is extremely nice uh who helped

330
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,680
us make sure that

331
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,839
we were not making any mistakes in the

332
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,440
implementation of the

333
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,200
different cryptographic routines that he

334
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,800
would provide

335
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,399
we made sure that the way we used nasi

336
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,079
vector sets that

337
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,239
we didn't make any mistakes always good

338
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,959
encrypted storage so these routines are

339
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,480
used to uh

340
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,240
to encrypt the different credentials you

341
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,160
have on your device so we have

342
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,480
actually a dedicated flash memory uh

343
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,360
that is

344
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,560
uh aimed at storing the credential data

345
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,079
so we have two types of data we have

346
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,600
credentials logins passwords

347
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,360
usual ones that you use login to your

348
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,600
website and we have web button data

349
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,959
which is basically like the

350
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,040
password-less authentication feature

351
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,040
that actually i referred to before

352
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,560
and the other type of data is actually

353
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,320
encrypted blob so what i mean by printed

354
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,240
blocks is like small five small notes so

355
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,000
the device itself can actually store

356
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,680
like small

357
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,440
for example recovery keys of your uh

358
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,000
bitcoin wallet or small nodes some

359
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,680
secrets that you want to solve we're not

360
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,399
aiming at

361
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,880
uh we're not aiming to store gigabytes

362
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,560
of data we just want to store like the

363
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,920
most critical data that you're

364
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,200
interested in

365
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,480
uh internally it's a sorted list sorted

366
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,360
linked linked list data structure so

367
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,480
actually the small animation you're

368
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,079
seeing on the right is actually

369
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,720
this is comes from our emulator so you

370
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,519
can actually

371
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,440
test you can actually try the complete

372
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,440
multi-pass ecosystem without even having

373
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,200
a hardware device like we

374
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,000
we have device emulators for linux and

375
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,040
windows

376
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,920
mac os not yet but soon and as i was

377
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,639
saying before

378
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,720
the the multi-pass device can actually

379
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,320
allow more than 100 users to

380
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,360
to store credentials on

381
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,399
smart cards so we basically is a smart

382
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,440
card for matmal

383
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,720
uh which is spin locked we the new

384
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,240
devices actually

385
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,000
we selected the pin mapping in such a

386
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,160
way that we can start transitioning into

387
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,079
other forms of secure memories

388
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,560
because we don't want to be uh dependent

389
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,000
on one kind so like

390
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,480
in the future you may expect uh support

391
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,120
for more

392
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,000
uh for more uh secure memories

393
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,040
so basically the users enters its pin on

394
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,720
the display on the display as you can

395
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,279
see

396
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,000
in the small animation and then the if

397
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,399
the pin is validated then the aes key is

398
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,120
recovered from the smart card

399
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,279
random number generator uh it's always

400
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,560
fun to try to find

401
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,920
ways of getting random data

402
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,600
for this device we're actually using we

403
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,959
found a few papers

404
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,959
online that we're using the

405
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,480
least significant bits of accelerometer

406
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,360
data

407
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,920
so the accelerometer on the device uh is

408
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,839
outputting 16 bits

409
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,959
output words and when you're sampling

410
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,440
when basically you're sampling 2g when

411
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,360
your sanking range is 2g

412
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,360
you can be sure that the last four or

413
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,639
five least significant

414
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,480
bits are going to be pure noise so just

415
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,880
to make sure uh we are using the last

416
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,440
twos

417
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,800
uh last two least significant bits

418
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,519
this the the quality of our randomness

419
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,720
was extensively

420
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,120
tested using die harder tests and on

421
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,079
devices and

422
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,720
on our device itself we are uh have a

423
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,320
few routines to make sure

424
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,040
that the data we are getting is actually

425
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,680
is actually random

426
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,920
um communication with the outside world

427
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,279
so the the device

428
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,600
communicates with your computer or

429
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,959
smartphone

430
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,160
using bluetooth or usb and

431
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,639
the protocol on these links is actually

432
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,480
hid human interface device

433
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,440
so when you connect the the device to

434
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,320
your computer is

435
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,720
detected as an external keyboard and

436
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,759
also presenting

437
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,000
another proprietary which is which

438
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,680
basically means that it's random

439
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,720
is sending some custom data

440
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,440
so we have the property channel for

441
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,120
facilitating the management of the

442
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,680
device

443
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,399
and like the interesting for example

444
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,920
credential recall feature that i

445
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,399
mentioned

446
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,880
you go to a website and it authentic it

447
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,560
authenticates for you

448
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,000
this is done through the popularity

449
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,240
channel but we also have a channel that

450
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:14,800
is

451
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,920
dedicated to simulating key presses

452
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,160
so what i mean by simulating key presses

453
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,759
is that

454
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,800
the device itself can simulate

455
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,440
keypresses in order to make your

456
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,360
computer believe that you're

457
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,519
it's you typing on your keyboard

458
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,560
pressing abc the different keys

459
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,399
what was what is particularly

460
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,399
particularly interesting on this feature

461
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,959
is that uh i'm pretty sure some of you

462
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,079
may know

463
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,560
your keyboard actually doesn't send the

464
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,320
uh character to your computer

465
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,199
the your keyboard is gonna send the kind

466
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,000
of the physical

467
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,279
location of the key you're pressing

468
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,839
and then the translation between the

469
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,279
physical location of

470
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,079
this key to the character that is

471
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,519
recognized by your computer

472
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,240
is up to your computer so for example on

473
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,760
your computer for example i have a

474
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,319
french

475
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,959
layout that is configured uh some may

476
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,400
have slovenian like we have different

477
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,359
countries so

478
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,760
this the multipath needs to do the

479
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,039
translation between

480
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,520
the character that needs to be typed and

481
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,199
the sequence of keys

482
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,919
that needs to be sent to the computer so

483
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,799
that means

484
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,199
a lot of lookup tables between

485
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:25,919
characters

486
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,520
and key codes so these were generated

487
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,760
used by passing the unicode common local

488
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,160
data repository so there is a

489
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,520
great website which is cldr.org

490
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,440
that basically tells you okay if you

491
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,960
want to type that character this is the

492
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,039
sequence of keys you need to mention

493
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,120
uh we briefly mentioned the interesting

494
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,760
facts of different accents

495
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,960
like in french we have a lot a r like

496
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,080
the circumflex

497
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,520
accents all the different key

498
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,760
combinations that you need to handle in

499
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,520
order to properly type unicode

500
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,960
which was quite interesting to implement

501
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,880
but the upside of this is once you have

502
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,320
implemented all the scripts and once

503
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,240
you've added all the lookup tables into

504
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,200
the device

505
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,480
that basically allows you to uh type

506
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,799
any password any password uh

507
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,240
to on any kind of device uh

508
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,919
by the way don't like i'm seeing some

509
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,440
questions on the chat do not hesitate to

510
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,039
ask me uh someone asked

511
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,280
uh if when it will have available to

512
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,559
purchase it's

513
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,240
uh it's actually available to purchase

514
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,880
on tindy

515
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,080
what about an authentication so the

516
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,760
project as i said the project itself is

517
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,480
open source

518
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,960
uh like everything is online we don't

519
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,240
have any secrets

520
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,520
except the encryption keys obviously so

521
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,520
for example one of the amazing

522
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,799
contributions that were done

523
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,400
was by a single contributor that

524
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,000
actually uh

525
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,039
by himself implemented passwordless

526
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,640
authentication so web button which is

527
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,160
also called fido 2

528
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,400
the successor fido universal second

529
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,480
factor is basically an uprev of that of

530
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:00,880
that

531
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,080
of that thing so this uh contributor

532
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,120
by himself actually added updated the

533
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,440
firmware i've added the features on the

534
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,720
lcd microcontroller and my

535
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,000
microcontroller and

536
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,200
because of this um now allows us to

537
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,559
uh to benefit from from password-less

538
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,240
authentication so

539
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,880
at the bottom of this of the script

540
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,559
sorry at the bottom of the screen

541
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,799
you can basically see how that works so

542
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,960
basically when you want to login into a

543
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,600
website

544
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,039
like when you want to register to a

545
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,840
website that website is going to

546
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,640
send you a public key you're going to

547
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,400
generate a private key then basically

548
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:40,640
it's

549
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,240
like this is going to be an exchange of

550
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,720
public keys and from this

551
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,919
you will be able to uh seamlessly log

552
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,320
into the website by just signing

553
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,600
challenges it's as simple as that

554
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,160
supports by different websites is

555
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,840
ongoing

556
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,559
it takes a little time we are in

557
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:01,200
constant

558
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,200
we are in contact with major websites

559
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,720
for different details that we are

560
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,400
noticing so like if you want to spread

561
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,520
the web

562
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,520
the web authent world it's highly

563
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,679
welcome uh because we are seeing some

564
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,200
white side that basically

565
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,440
or only want to but that say that

566
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,280
supports fido and fido 2

567
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,120
but concretely they still want to go on

568
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,120
video so like the

569
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,480
bottom line is that it's still working

570
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,559
progress but we

571
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,280
at least on our side we are we are good

572
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,200
i think

573
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,159
graphics library it was designed from

574
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,440
the ground up

575
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,799
so as i said this is our third device

576
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,159
we came a long way from the first one uh

577
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,480
on the third one we wanted to do it well

578
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,400
we wanted the experience to be really

579
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,360
nice we wanted

580
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,840
to have a nice interface uh the

581
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,200
animation you see is actually what you

582
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,640
would see on the device except that the

583
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,520
screen is blue

584
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,559
it's not white um and

585
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,880
on each device more or less there is one

586
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,600
thousand

587
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,080
one one thousand bitmaps so like we

588
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,200
support different

589
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,200
uh animations all that all that stuff

590
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,039
like we wanted like

591
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,360
to have we wanted a nice interface on

592
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,240
the device

593
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,159
so we have run length encoding

594
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,679
compression so we don't use all the

595
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,400
dedicated flash that is

596
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,840
all the flash that is dedicated to

597
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,480
storing bitmaps we support

598
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,080
multiple fonts the fonts are

599
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,159
pre-rendered so i think on the device

600
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,159
right now we have five different fonts

601
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,000
depending if you have prompts of if you

602
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,159
have prompts if your notifications

603
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,679
if you have like for example subtitles

604
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,520
on the screen you're seeing now so like

605
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,360
just we really spent a lot of effort

606
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,200
trying to make the user experience nice

607
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,280
uh on our first generation devices we

608
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,520
had like one or two fonts one for like

609
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,520
prompts and like one two display

610
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,960
credentials that was pretty much it

611
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,679
as i was saying we have a dedicated

612
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:52,880
dedicated

613
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,000
data storage flash

614
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,280
that stores lots of data

615
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,480
so as you saw before we are showing uh

616
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,679
restoring bitmaps we are storing fonts

617
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,559
uh not only that we also have for

618
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,280
example

619
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,840
uh oh we have an interesting problem

620
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,679
never mind

621
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,799
so we have uh bitmaps that is that are

622
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:17,679
dedicated

623
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,880
to the language that is selected by the

624
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,760
user

625
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,880
so user may choose

626
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,360
on the device itself uh the language

627
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,720
that it wants its

628
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,919
device to be so we we don't

629
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,159
like uh you don't need to update your

630
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,400
device to support to be in french like

631
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,400
everything can be selected on the on the

632
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,720
device itself by the way if you want to

633
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,679
contribute to

634
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,480
uh to adding more languages highly

635
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,440
welcome

636
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,360
uh in short it's like we have a text

637
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,679
file of 150 strings more or less

638
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,240
that you just need to translate this

639
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,400
we as i said we implemented a window

640
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,679
only file system

641
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,000
uh that also supports the totally stores

642
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,600
thermal updates

643
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,280
the complete flash uh is crc checked and

644
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,760
cbc mac checked

645
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,480
pretty sure a lot of you know that

646
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,720
checking the integrity of a bundle is

647
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,559
uh always challenging the

648
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,799
honest mistaking like one of the last

649
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,400
hardware talks was

650
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,520
how the nintendo one of the nintendo

651
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,720
game console uh was uh

652
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,600
so how we could add more games by uh

653
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,559
just

654
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,200
using one of the techniques of the badly

655
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,840
chosen ctr

656
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,679
uh integrity checks

657
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,240
so here we are cbc marking the complete

658
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,640
flash

659
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,039
there you go okay other noteworthy

660
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,400
feature that most

661
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,000
most of them already mentioned

662
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,840
not only did we want to make sure that

663
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,360
the user experience

664
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,679
on the device on the device was nice

665
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,000
we also wanted to allow the user to

666
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,480
select the trade-off between

667
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,679
security and uh user friendliness like

668
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,919
it's always the we always have the same

669
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,240
discussion it's okay you want the device

670
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,679
to be intrusive you want to be prompted

671
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:12,640
for every

672
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,640
device every operation you're gonna do

673
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,480
on the device what do you want to do

674
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,080
or do you want to let the device do what

675
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,600
it wants to do so like

676
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,679
on this device on the on the device

677
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,039
itself you can actually select the

678
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:23,919
behavior

679
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,480
uh of the device you can actually select

680
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,159
between being prompted for every single

681
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,840
notification you can

682
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,039
select okay to you you can

683
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,600
tell the device okay please show me your

684
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,440
authentication hashes like we have a

685
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:37,919
complete

686
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,000
set of features that even the most

687
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,279
security concerns

688
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,960
consensus people can actually use the

689
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,840
device but also for example my

690
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,039
grandmother so we really want to

691
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,559
to cover the complete spectrum and to

692
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,240
allow you to select the

693
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,880
the behavior of devices there on the

694
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,400
device itself we have

695
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,559
a custom we have a nickel metal hydride

696
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,640
battery so old-school batteries but we

697
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,240
actually have a lot more

698
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,799
discharge charge cycles than the

699
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,720
lithium-ion counterparts so we design

700
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,360
our own

701
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,600
charging algorithms our own state of

702
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,799
charge algorithm

703
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,840
so that's more or less it for the harder

704
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,240
device

705
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,279
i'm gonna going to do i still have five

706
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,480
minutes left i think

707
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,320
i'm gonna mention the software side of

708
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,240
things on the software we have a

709
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,520
companion uh user interface uh multicute

710
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,640
which was originally

711
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,279
designed by one of the contributors then

712
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,480
we actually

713
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,240
we have a few freelancers working on

714
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,559
them on the on the user interface that

715
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,240
allows you to completely customize the

716
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,559
behavior of the device

717
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,840
also allows you to uh browse the

718
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,279
different credentials stored on the

719
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:45,840
device

720
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,640
unless this is so important me looking

721
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,000
at the different credentials

722
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,159
uh stored on device changing logins

723
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,840
seeing when it was a success less

724
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,120
modified

725
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,559
specified the category of the

726
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,240
credentials and

727
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,760
a whole bunch of different settings

728
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,039
as i was saying also the the device can

729
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,000
store

730
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,840
nodes can store can also store small

731
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,320
files like

732
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,960
like many recovery keys i mentioned

733
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,279
before

734
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,640
also allows you to so

735
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,720
not only multiple users can actually use

736
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,880
one device but actually

737
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,080
one user can use multiple devices so

738
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,200
that

739
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,760
creates the the challenge of

740
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,760
synchronizing the database between

741
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,000
different devices so we have a few tools

742
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,919
to actually facilitate that

743
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,240
you can use one device at home one

744
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,919
device at work

745
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,720
um and you if for example if you have a

746
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,320
dropbox or some share you can

747
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,039
have the you can have multicut monitor

748
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:47,919
that file

749
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,880
in order to make sure uh that the your

750
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,320
device is up to date

751
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,480
one quick mention one one quick mention

752
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,520
i want to

753
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,880
to to do is that um these

754
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,080
uh export files uh

755
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,600
together with a smart card reader and

756
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,440
your smart card would allow you

757
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,440
to recover your credentials in case of

758
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,720
in case of

759
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,960
if you break your device so like i want

760
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,039
to say there is no vendor locking

761
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,760
so once you have the multi-pass like

762
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,520
you're not locked into the multi-pass if

763
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,360
one day your device breaks or you're

764
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,880
just tired of it

765
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,919
you can take the export backup which is

766
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,520
encrypted using the ace key of your

767
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,399
smart card

768
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,240
use a smart card reader to recover your

769
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,240
is key and decrypt your complete

770
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,720
database so just like this there is no

771
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,080
vendor locking on that one i want to

772
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,640
make uh

773
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,760
to make it clear uh we have a few other

774
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,559
uh other tools we have uh as i mentioned

775
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,000
browser extension

776
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,200
uh chrome firefox opera edge uh safari

777
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,640
kind of uh so apple keeps changing

778
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,559
the stance on the web extension support

779
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,240
it has made things quite interesting

780
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,799
over the last uh few years so in short

781
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,159
you have the extension installed on

782
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,440
chrome firefox you go to

783
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,440
into a website it will automatically log

784
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,200
you in you will be either notified or

785
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,880
prompted on the device and

786
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,159
you will seamlessly seamlessly

787
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,200
log into the website

788
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,080
we also have a command line tool that is

789
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,120
shipped by default

790
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,760
in your multiput installation here

791
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,440
basically you can see me

792
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,200
querying the device for the test

793
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,120
service and directly in the command line

794
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,720
you can get the password done on the

795
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,640
device

796
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,640
you have an ssh agent um which

797
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,679
is not uh which recovers the private

798
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,120
keys from your device in order to

799
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,520
authenticate you into assisted servers

800
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,080
uh but you may have seen that recently

801
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:42,559
opus

802
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,679
open ssh has started supporting fido 2

803
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,679
or web button

804
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,399
authentication so actually right now if

805
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:50,880
you

806
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,559
uh there's a few comments we have a few

807
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,159
tutorials like you can set up your

808
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:54,640
server

809
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,679
to use a web button or fido 2

810
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,159
hardware devices to log in so i actually

811
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,279
recommend that but

812
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,480
if you have all generation servers that

813
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,039
requires rsc rsa keys and all that we

814
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,720
also have an ssh agent

815
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,520
that allows you to log you in sims

816
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,120
seamlessly

817
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,159
we have a python framework uh one

818
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,120
of uh well actually have two uh first

819
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,799
one is for the multi-pass mini first

820
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,480
generation device that is a bit

821
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,000
more complete than the one we have of

822
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
the minible

823
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,640
if you want to script operations on your

824
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,279
device

825
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,919
uh basically we provide a few files that

826
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:32,880
allows you to

827
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,679
interface with your device using python

828
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:36,640
here you see

829
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,679
me recording the the

830
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,600
some details about the the multi-part i

831
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,840
have

832
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,600
that's pretty much it on the software

833
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,720
side of things contributors are highly

834
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,000
welcome one thing that is

835
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,159
strongly lacking from what we have right

836
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,919
now is better integration with

837
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,760
smartphones so i sure you may know that

838
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,360
android or ios

839
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,720
has some autofills services

840
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,120
that basically whenever you want to log

841
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,080
in

842
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,200
on your smartphone to any service like

843
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:09,919
you

844
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,880
may have hooks into some android or ios

845
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,919
services

846
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,880
to look for credentials so actually in

847
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,600
theory

848
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,120
uh by just implementing a simple app on

849
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,279
the smartphone and the right service on

850
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,480
the device itself

851
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,559
we could have native integration uh with

852
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,080
smartphones so this is some something

853
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,200
that we really think

854
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,120
like could help a lot of people because

855
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,559
right now you can

856
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,320
the only way to interact with your

857
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,080
smartphones is using native credential

858
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,159
week also on the device you select which

859
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,240
credential you want to send you want to

860
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,840
send to your

861
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,120
smartphone and that's pretty much it

862
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,600
uh if you want to contact us we move

863
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,799

thank you so much matthew uh i see that

873
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,720
there's somebody who already posted

874
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,720
about the product being available in

875
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,039
july so thank you so much uh for

876
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,039
creating such a wonderful tool

877
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,000
anybody has any questions on the product

878
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,720
uh

879
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,440
tool or if you would like to contribute

880
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,159
uh

881
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:29,200
to multipass uh it would be nice

882
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,960
now we also will also mention that uh

883
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,360
component shortages

884
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,360
so the device is actually available you

885
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,640
can be we actually had a few

886
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,840
contributors building them

887
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,640
devices themselves uh we sell it but the

888
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,000
component shortage

889
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,080
makes it like tough so it's actually

890
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,919
available on our website it says it's

891
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,279
available in july but

892
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,360
if you look on google you will be able

893
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,360
to find it

894
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,080
all right martin says you answered all

895
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,640
his questions uh in the talk already

896
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,760
so that's good maybe uh matthew uh

897
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,600
i do not know if this is something that

898
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,519
you have thought about with the team

899
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,159
but do you want to share about you know

900
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,279
what are the

901
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,240
future features that would be available

902
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:12,960
in the

903
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,840
future editions

904
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,200
um so actually i'm actually opening

905
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,159
right now the

906
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,120
the issue so we make we are making

907
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,200
extensive use of the issue list

908
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,360
on our github repository so if you go to

909
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,640
github slash multipass

910
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,919
mini ble go to issues we actually

911
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,440
categorize each issue

912
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,519
as feature requests books and stuff like

913
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,919
that for me release like this would be

914
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,440
integration with the smartphones because

915
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,240
it would make

916
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,799
things way easier we have a few feature

917
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:43,840
requests on

918
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,679
additional delays like there is

919
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,039
depending on the computer

920
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,960
setup of each person for example we have

921
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,159
someone saying that

922
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,640
like we have a feature but basically you

923
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,240
insert your card you log in

924
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,320
and it will offer you to send your

925
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,480
credentials for your computer so like

926
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,559
let's say that you have a windows device

927
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,720
locked by locked by default

928
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,720
and set your card it will it will prompt

929
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,880
you to send the credentials for you

930
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,519
and on some interesting setups like you

931
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,799
need an additional delay so

932
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,559
there is a lot of small features that

933
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,000
actually really easy to get into the

934
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,519
multi-pass ecosystem

935
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,919
that actually have a strong impact on

936
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:18,799
people that are actually

937
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,840
using the device uh people that have

938
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,600
like organization managed devices that

939
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,440
require that have interesting setups

940
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,279
that require some small fine tuning of

941
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,559
the device itself

942
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,480
uh it's a small feature small stuff but

943
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,559
actually that has a lot of impact

944
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:37,120
uh but okay going back to your questions

945
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,240
like for me would be

946
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,399
integration with smart uh with better

947
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:41,840
integration with smartphones this is the

948
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,799
one that

949
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,600
pops up the most

950
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,000
okay that's nice to you

951
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,320
any other questions from the audience

952
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,320
okay are there any plans for what comes

953
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,840
after the mini ble

954
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,159
also i think i remember all the devices

955
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,000
having limited space for new firmware

956
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,120
features

957
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,159
how is the mini ble doing on space we

958
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:08,960
are still good

959
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,599
fifty percent on uh on the main

960
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:12,719
microcontroller

961
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,199
main microscope main microcontroller

962
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,800
flash space we have 50

963
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,040
so on this one we see a half margin

964
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,760
honestly if you have a lot of time to

965
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,800
implement

966
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,679
uh a lot of time to contribute you could

967
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,040
implement

968
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,719
your bitcoin wallet on it but

969
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,040
like like always it's always the time

970
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,960
that the time of the contributors that

971
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,520
is precious

972
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:48,079
okay uh i don't see any more questions

973
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,560
matthew so yeah matthew thank you so

974
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,520
much for sharing

on hardware.io friends we will open the

979
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,760
breakout room now

980
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,079
uh to interact with matthew if you like

981
