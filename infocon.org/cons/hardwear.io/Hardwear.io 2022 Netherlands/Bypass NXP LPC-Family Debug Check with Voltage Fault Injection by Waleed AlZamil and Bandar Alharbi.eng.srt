1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,580
hello everyone thank you for coming uh

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,259
Welcome to talak My name is

3
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:30,359
[Music]

4
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:31,439
see

5
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,300
after that we'll give you any

6
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,540
information

7
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,480
these examples

8
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,440
lastly we will talk about attack and

9
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,399
so we have used the NBC 1353 it is part

10
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,280
of the NBC family we have the

11
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,280
Olympics

12
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:03,539
can see this instructions

13
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,220
uh some of the previous work that I've

14
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,000
done in their disease

15
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,939
so our main goal is to try to study the

16
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,360
LBC about working mechanism then we will

17
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,619
try to Target

18
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,680
the LBC series they have something

19
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,240
called Accord protection CRV CRP is the

20
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,939
conclusion name in the nxp some other

21
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:52,220
things

22
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,060
such as excuses

23
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:00,000
uh they have available actions so I'll

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,460
be one two and three all of them will

25
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,920
disable the JPEG and each of them will

26
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,740
have a dedicated value so the main

27
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,419
difference between them is related to

28
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,739
the ISP minus destruction the ISP is a

29
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:17,819
Serial uh protocol to access the memory

30
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,200
action

31
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,420
NBC to do some operations such as

32
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,860
so reviews are easily just

33
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,280
just by writing the crb value here

34
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,420
a specific address

35
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,720
and it will let you get the opportunity

36
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,959
and for the LBC 13 series is

37
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,879
the address is the 0x

38
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,599
and in this table we can see remember

39
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,859
the CRV is set

40
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,519
and here we have the nbc13 lab

41
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,519
exists

42
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,399
the second one is

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,060
yes and the third one is the right side

44
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,800
respond to the system before register

45
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,800
which is actually recognizable

46
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,360
it gets used to

47
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,319
do a disabled

48
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,420
and here we have the Boost process

49
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,760
we have two area where the CRP will be

50
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,180
checked the first one is the green area

51
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,280
which will be targeted this is just

52
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,980
simply reading the filter of 0x square C

53
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,819
and paste it is

54
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:55,680
in case of any matching it will disable

55
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,920
the JTAG in other cases another case it

56
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,280
will just

57
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,879
area where the ispu commands should

58
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:09,679
happen and there is

59
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:19,019
again to do the ISP

60
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,500
that's

61
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,419
nice

62
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:27,859
okay after we've done that because

63
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,060
it's basically nothing

64
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,199
so we did reverse this part of this

65
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,100
process

66
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,979
as you kind of did as you see at the

67
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:52,320
beginning it will load I needed value

68
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,380
and prepare the register then it will

69
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,860
load the function of 0x to a c e to r or

70
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,160
register

71
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,500
and this in that content

72
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,740
that we have the three main scenarios

73
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,840
let's start with the COPD

74
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:25,699
and there it will lower the crp2

75
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:27,900
throughout the resistance as you can see

76
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,259
here and after that it will store the

77
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:34,020
auto register resistance register to

78
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,219
disable the jpeg

79
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,560
today

80
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:01,280
and here it's been again

81
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,440
then

82
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,600
after register will distort the system

83
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,479
doesn't register okay type

84
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:13,139
and so again let's help you evaluates

85
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,680
used here

86
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,100
and other cases including crp2 which

87
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,780
will follow the WR

88
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,739
and this is

89
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:36,240
the distance equal to the crp2 it will

90
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,880
disabled Zeta in other cases it's

91
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,639
enabled

92
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,419
uh so we can notice here it's like a

93
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:48,318
magic value

94
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,500
which is

95
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,199
okay in this slide you try to abstract

96
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,319
produce process

97
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,680
it's usually

98
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,819
uh

99
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,340
foreign

100
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:19,199
so we have an attack

101
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,000
while regarding the application memory

102
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,720
somehow the integration value or

103
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,560
registered value or bypassion

104
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,860
and as you can see in the excusework

105
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,479
most NPC have I will know exactly the

106
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:40,979
CRV configuration

107
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:42,479
uh

108
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,360
you can see it's a 32-bit register where

109
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,620
the only key values is used

110
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,138
so we have much chances

111
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:57,318
is

112
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,880
hello again in this slide in upcoming

113
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,800
our brief of what is Fault injection

114
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,259
techniques and some examples so both

115
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,360
injection is basically a hardware

116
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,520
corruption during the execution on a

117
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,979
normal device this Hardware corruption

118
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:19,080
would cause

119
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,900
defined behavior and

120
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,960
sometimes it's a h flip

121
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,780
even instruction or even changing in the

122
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,539
structure the interesting interesting

123
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:32,820
thing is sometimes even though if you

124
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,120
execute the same exact exact glitch

125
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,700
again the causes May differ especially

126
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,919
in the case of a lot of stretching and

127
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:44,520
clock glitching and it becomes more

128
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,140
accurate to the Advanced Techniques

129
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,640
speaking of techniques we have clock

130
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,459
glitching as you know every CPU contains

131
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:54,480
the clock

132
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,300
clock is known to be steady so messing

133
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,980
with the crop signal could lead to a

134
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,040
glitch and it can considered to be an

135
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,620
easy low cost and doesn't require High

136
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,080
skills if the device is using external

137
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,519
also about this glitching is a technique

138
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,459
voltage glitching is simply by tampering

139
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:16,260
the supply voltage

140
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,660
for example pulling down the right

141
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,459
amount of voltage with the right amount

142
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,519
of time could lead to a glitch and our

143
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,140
talk is based on this technique

144
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,399
another technique is electromagnetic

145
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,700
bleaching em basically it's a strong em

146
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,600
alls to cause a ball usually the am

147
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,940
pulse is generated by a coil of wire

148
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,459
which will generate a strong current and

149
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:43,800
cause the fault this technique is

150
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,660
usually considered to be a higher cost

151
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,360
than voltage glitching also good

152
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,940
understanding is needed to be able to

153
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,300
get a successful glitch

154
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,940
another technique and consider to be an

155
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,100
advanced technique which is laser

156
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,120
glitching

157
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,820
laser glitching happen by applying

158
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,800
strong pulse

159
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,220
laser pulse to a decapsulated IC this

160
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,380
kind of dark require High expertise and

161
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:14,220
expenses however has a high accuracy

162
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,180
results

163
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,640
and also we have other techniques such

164
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,620
as per device and rejection and

165
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,760
temperature lens Etc

166
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:26,160
is it difficult well it depends several

167
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,680
years ago or this could release the city

168
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,680
of challenges and there were a specific

169
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,839
challenge called Fiesta which is based

170
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,000
on a pulse injection one way to solve

171
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,580
this challenge is only using a jumper

172
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,399
wire you can show the external clock

173
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,800
terminals on the jumper wire to mess

174
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,899
with the cloud signal and cause a glitch

175
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:48,740
to solve this challenge

176
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,660
and also it could be more complex with

177
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,480
the encapsulation and the double or even

178
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,820
the throttle based appearance

179
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:02,880
examples we have the famous Air Tech

180
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,620
attack attack smashing advantage to

181
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,880
voltage against the attack

182
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,740
s last year in the talk here in Hardware

183
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:16,500
also we have another example the

184
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,260
bypassing Android MDM using electron

185
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,140
magnetic Earth injection and the tool

186
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,699
was a gas lighter

187
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,640
and also here is the famous disco

188
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,820
knowledge several people mentioned below

189
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,980
they were able to extract the pin number

190
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,620
of the wallets by applying voltage or

191
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,820
electrical graphic glitch

192
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,519
now with the code read let's move on to

193
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,260
our attack

194
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:50,040
Recon 2017 taught by Chris grinski he

195
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,320
was able to bypass the ISP which were

196
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,519
the security feature on nxplpc by

197
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:59,940
applying for voltage fault injection to

198
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,040
access the flash memory this stock

199
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,579
inspired us to go further and look for a

200
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:08,040
variability that will leverage re-enable

201
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,680
movie The debug interface and have full

202
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,160
control of the microcontroller

203
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,620
and I can hear the NPC saying I'm ready

204
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,459
to get charged again

205
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,920
as you can see here this is our actual

206
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,880
setup

207
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,480
the LPC 1343 on the left the power and

208
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,640
the glitch comes from the cheapest pro

209
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,700
which is the device on the right and on

210
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,320
the top we have the default probe

211
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,540
connected to the LPC to check whether

212
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:40,019
the debug and spaces happen or not we

213
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,320
also use the PCB bytes where the glitch

214
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,120
will come through and it's called the

215
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,899
poison needle uh BCP fighters from

216
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:52,380
cinepic company and help us solve the

217
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,560
rest also we removed the decoupling

218
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,139
capacity on the v-core to make our image

219
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:00,120
more convenient as shown in the

220
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,839
schematic in the rights

221
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:06,420
here's the setup diagram setup the PC

222
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,740
was connected to the both

223
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:12,120
the checklist for as a powerful other

224
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,860
Source Hardware from New Age

225
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,540
technological side Channel power

226
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,500
analysis and let's

227
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,839
so from the full form analysis

228
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:30,380
we have a team basic Solutions

229
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,800
and as you can see here

230
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,279
two dollars and

231
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,839
this is the CRP when it's set

232
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,760
you can see in the middle there's a

233
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,600
little bit shift and uh it is

234
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,959
the CRV one will execute the different

235
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,940
scenarios

236
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,720
and here we overlap a few traces so that

237
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,399
it should be more obvious

238
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,860
um

239
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,760
so now we have the right range to apply

240
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,880
the image the setup is ready about the

241
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,899
code to

242
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:24,899
start creating our trigger was based on

243
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:27,480
a recent spin so we are visiting the

244
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,480
device wait until the range glitch and

245
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,360
so on however with no luck

246
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,940
then we decided to change the setup and

247
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,160
paste the trigger on the power on cycle

248
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,620
so we power on the device Waits until

249
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,860
the range bridge and fall off and so on

250
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,800
after a while we successfully were

251
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,860
able to unlock the debugging space why

252
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,600
was it successful when we changed the

253
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,920
setup

254
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,020
[Music]

255
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,120
because it's shown in the 300 candle

256
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,820
that after each reset it will check the

257
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,399
debugging space therefore our initial

258
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,920
setup was based on this diagram however

259
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,380
when we change the setup based on the

260
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,079
power one off cycle the glitch succeeded

261
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,199
and able to unlock the debug interface

262
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,880
and now we can recovery

263
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,880
so we here have uh

264
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,720
CRP

265
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:46,740
you can see after each Village we

266
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,420
shaking the window

267
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,300
if the controller is enabled or not

268
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,459
eventually we

269
00:15:56,459 --> 00:16:01,518
exceeded to re-enable because it is

270
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,120
try to access your NBC electricity

271
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:14,540
and we try to read the content of 0x2 FC

272
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:19,100
which contains the crp3 value

273
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,399
and this is a trace screenshots from

274
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,480
glitching crp1

275
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,899
crp2 Village

276
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:36,120
this is a proof that we are able to

277
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,480
manage all CRP values and able to unlock

278
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,560
the debug interface

279
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:46,519
let's start a little bit about history

280
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:51,300
before 2006 NBC Microsoft

281
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,240
Phillips time they developed the LBC q14

282
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,540
series

283
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:03,540
so we searched documents for ellipticals

284
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,319
crosses

285
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,419
the Boost process

286
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:14,819
as you can see it's almost the same the

287
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:17,659
XP is used

288
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,520
from the ecology detection it seems the

289
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,280
magic value used is the same as the CR

290
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:33,059
the LBC family so based on

291
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:36,299
user manuals we look to all the LBC

292
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:40,140
controller and always list sharing the

293
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,320
same mechanisms

294
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,020
so we assume you might have be having

295
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,379
the same

296
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:52,140
and in the following is we changed the

297
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,480
Boost process and let's see Direction

298
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,900
mechanism so this is used for something

299
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:02,280
called ecrb which is detection

300
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,960
in the LBC 546 series which has

301
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,240
different approach to enable the JP card

302
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,520
by sitting into

303
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,520
investigated

304
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:25,260
and the last one is the NBC 55 series

305
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,679
which is

306
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,400
different uh

307
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,559
so to conclude we reverse entry with a

308
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,480
blue film and talk about consumption

309
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,360
traces and

310
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,039
comparing we figure out the range that

311
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,620
we should apply the glitch we apply the

312
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,020
glitch based on a reset Trigger or to

313
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,840
the knowledge change the setup to paste

314
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,539
our trigger on a power on cycle then we

315
00:18:57,539 --> 00:18:59,760
were able to successfully re-enable the

316
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,460
debug interface and helpful control of

317
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,860
the microcontroller another thing to

318
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,900
mention is the CRP locking mechanism

319
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,299
existence Phillips time

320
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:12,419
we also contacted nxp to discuss they

321
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:14,760
were very professional and past think

322
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,500
that's for highlighting the news feeding

323
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,600
step under this process diagram

324
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,299
and I hope you learned something also

325
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:24,799
and thank you for listening

326
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:32,059
all right thanks for leads and bondar

327
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:35,460
uh we have some time for questions do we

328
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,100
have some questions from the audience

329
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,240
yes we do yeah

330
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,640
might have missed it but I don't think

331
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,380
you said how you actually got the jump

332
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,960
for the Google was it just unprotected

333
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,580
and you could just read it out of memory

334
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,280
or was anything special actually it's

335
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,600
just uh connected everybody

336
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,039
and just leave that address

337
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,879
do we have any other questions

338
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,660
okay I've got one uh you mentioned in

339
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,280
the end that you consulted in a speed to

340
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,620
disclose this problem uh they fixed the

341
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,539
documentation of this let's see what

342
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:27,200
else did they do

343
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,320
hey I'm not sure they increase the

344
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,960
documentation already because we

345
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,559
discussed it two months ago and to be

346
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:38,720
able to

347
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,760
litigate this kind of attack Solutions

348
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,299
foreign to be able to

349
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:51,059
start this Mission did they inform you

350
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:53,820
that they plan to do some mitigations to

351
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:58,039
introduce the mitigations to this

352
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,220
um

353
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,380
thank you do we have any other questions

354
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,840
from the audience super I hope that's

355
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,080
one

356
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,940
hi guys thanks for your presentation

357
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,419
it's fantastic just a simple question so

358
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:28,020
you changed the trigger reset trigger to

359
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,100
have all

360
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,640
uh was it just time that you used as the

361
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,980
basis for actually when you did the

362
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,840
trigger the reason I asked this question

363
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,039
is

364
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:41,340
I have exploited the ear tag which much

365
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,539
more

366
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:45,000
um and what I found was

367
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,400
I actually used the oscilloscope to

368
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,640
trigger on just before the sort of dip

369
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,460
and it made it way more accurate so I'm

370
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,440
wondering if you sort of was it just

371
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,720
purely on power on any time or was any

372
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,100
other sort of

373
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,100
foreign

374
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,640
all right

375
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,480
last question

376
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,020
so let's give another round of close to

377
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,679
the guys
