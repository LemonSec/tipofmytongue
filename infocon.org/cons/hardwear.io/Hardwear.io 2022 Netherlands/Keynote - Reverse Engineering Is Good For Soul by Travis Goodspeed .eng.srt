1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,819
uh he's a big fan of whiskey so if you

2
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:07,200
guys have got something I'm gonna give

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,720
him uh or impress him getting drunk with

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,000
this I'm aware of that and yes this

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,700
secondary second part uh which is on

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,000
screen yes he's a big car fan as well uh

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,240
yeah

8
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,020
foreign

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,979
it helps to turn things on we learned

10
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,619
something about Electronics already

11
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,860
um okay so good morning everybody

12
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,020
um this show of hands

13
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,020
um who here enjoys the security

14
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,360
okay and who here enjoys reverse

15
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,860
engineering

16
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,720
all right now oh well keep your hand up

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,200
keep your hand up now lower your hand if

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,060
you kind of only do security as an

19
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,320
excuse to do reverse engineering

20
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,979
um this lecture today is about reverse

21
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:40,259
engineering and how much fun it is and

22
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,079
security is really not a part of the

23
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,180
section

24
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,460
I really I mean I I will do security

25
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,439
when I'm paid for it I will do security

26
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,720
when it's interesting

27
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,579
um but the real reason why I care about

28
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,020
this stuff is because I really like

29
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,060
taking stuff apart and when you take

30
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,680
stuff apart you get to see how it works

31
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,000
from the inside

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,439
and

33
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,880
um that's the sort of stuff that I would

34
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,000
do for free and that I do do for free

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,220
um if you find yourself writing C plus

36
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,660
plus after

37
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,060
calm down maybe that's a good profession

38
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,860
for you

39
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,060
um

40
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,920
so I'd like to begin by telling all of

41
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,319
you at this conference when you meet a

42
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:22,500
stranger to ask this question like what

43
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,780
are you tinkering with uh because if you

44
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,239
ask what do you do some people will

45
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,180
um name their employer or um begin

46
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,620
explaining their startup or something

47
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,720
when all you really want to know is like

48
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,819
a really cool trick for

49
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,319
um I don't know like recognizing

50
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,879
pointers when you reverse engineering

51
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,160
code for example in the 32-bit operating

52
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,040
system is the most significant bit of

53
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,720
the pointer is one it belongs to the

54
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,420
kernel if it's a zero it belongs to user

55
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,640
app in

56
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,379
um some two firmware if the least

57
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:55,260
significant bit of the pointer is a zero

58
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,300
it is probably data and a really

59
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,800
significant bit of the pointer is a one

60
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,340
it is probably code because in arm the

61
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,660
least significant bit of the program

62
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,840
counter indicates the execution mode

63
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,700
and there are there are lots of little

64
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,500
tricks like that you can share in

65
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,300
conversation as soon as you

66
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,920
confirm that you have a shared dialect

67
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,720
with the other person

68
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,220
um I I can't explain these pointer

69
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,260
tricks at my neighborhood bar no one

70
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,000
will understand them and I'll be wasting

71
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,099
my time which is why I come to things

72
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:28,440
like this because here I can have a deep

73
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,500
conversation about wherever my interests

74
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,000
overlap

75
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,260
um

76
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,280
just so for Mayan uh lately I've been

77
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,680
tinkering with this car and a few others

78
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,019
this is a Studebaker

79
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:46,080
um if you watch TV shows from the 1980s

80
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,819
there's always a punch line about a

81
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:50,340
Studebaker and the guy will say oh man

82
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,720
I'd love for you to give me a ride home

83
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,120
from the bar but I really can't have my

84
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,940
neighbors see me arrive at a Studebaker

85
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,500
um but I love these things because

86
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,900
they're old and they're cheap they're

87
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,239
easy to buy and they're easy to work on

88
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,580
and they're beautiful look at this

89
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,200
though

90
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,680
um I could pay 10 20 times as much just

91
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,120
to get something that looked like every

92
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,340
other car on the road

93
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,599
um

94
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,779
I've also been playing around with

95
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:21,680
um my buddy Justin Osborne on

96
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,560
simgreat.com which is an API server it's

97
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,840
not a startup it's just an API that you

98
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,699
can call we don't authenticate we don't

99
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:32,040
even know how many users we have

100
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,100
um basically you give me the first 18

101
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,040
bytes of the thumb 2 function and I give

102
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,380
you its name if it exists in any

103
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,380
publicly available rmsdk from the past

104
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,780
15 years

105
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,759
this is produced by having a collection

106
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,600
of all of these sdks embedded compilers

107
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,199
um

108
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,660
I don't mean to scare any young children

109
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,220
in the room but we used to have to pay

110
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,360
for Pilots

111
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,460
and in the embedded systems world we

112
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,360
still do

113
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,419
so uh if you don't know how to write

114
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:05,100
your own linking script and you were to

115
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,500
instead use a commercial compiler

116
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,120
you can

117
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,220
purchase one but they're available by

118
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,600
shareware so you download it from the

119
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,000
website you run it for 30 days or with a

120
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,280
restriction on the linking size

121
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,020
his linking size restriction is cool

122
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,880
because it means that the free version

123
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,979
of the compiler includes every library

124
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:25,139
from the full version of the hardware so

125
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,120
we were able to build a fingerprinting

126
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,979
database of all of the libraries from

127
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:30,360
all of the commercial C compilers

128
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,520
without having to license

129
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,520
uh if anyone from iar isn't licensed as

130
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,840
in the room please don't see the

131
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,699
out of me for this

132
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:39,539
um

133
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,900
the end result of this API we also like

134
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,419
client libraries for Ida Pro guidra

135
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:48,419
binary ninja so when you're working on a

136
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:49,860
project you don't know what your

137
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,020
function names are

138
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,000
upload the beginning of every function

139
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,720
to us and then we give you back

140
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,639
we do not log the queries but we have

141
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,520
every ability to so like don't do this

142
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,100
for any secret agent

143
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,180
um

144
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,979
we've been joking about doing a

145
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:11,539
professional version on DVD

146
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,940
I've also been working on a book of

147
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,020
microcontroller access so

148
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,660
uh if you want to reverse engineer a

149
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,880
device and that device is locked and

150
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,199
will not allow you to read the firmware

151
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,360
out and

152
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,720
it has a particular chip on it

153
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,340
um you basically look in the index of

154
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,380
this book you come to that page and then

155
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,600
it tells you how to exploit that word

156
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,060
the appendices cover more than 100

157
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,300
different published

158
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,360
um academic and blog post articles and

159
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,639
then every full chapter is an excellent

160
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,580
reverse engineering from scratch

161
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,900
one recent one that I've published early

162
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:56,220
is for these cards this is the the dish

163
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,819
network card by nagrivision

164
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,100
um David Mortensen was really hoping

165
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,919
would attend this conference

166
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,460
he wrote a secret paper in 1998 on how

167
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,139
to exploit these

168
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:12,600
while working for NDS and then during

169
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,880
the NDS Niagara lawsuit is secret

170
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,860
internal report was revealed through

171
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,360
Discovery so now you can download and

172
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,180
read it and it is a beautiful report it

173
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,280
shows how they began by sticking needles

174
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,639
into the chip in order to stun the

175
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:29,759
instruction fetch latch so that the CPU

176
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,380
kept thinking it was fetching the same

177
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,240
instruction and that turns the program

178
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,639
counter into a linear counter and then

179
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,620
the um the program counter just keeps

180
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,479
coming upward to the next fight and the

181
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:41,580
CPU keeps getting the same bite but the

182
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,800
real bite goes over the data bus so as

183
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,720
you're taking through this you have a

184
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,400
needle on one of the data bits and then

185
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,380
you get like all the least significant

186
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,680
bid for all of memory in order and then

187
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,300
you move the needle one over and then

188
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,400
you get all of

189
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,319
um bit one and bit two into three into

190
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,120
four and the five and did six into seven

191
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,800
and then you line them up and then you

192
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,139
have the complete firmer image

193
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:05,880
and the best part is that all of this

194
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,280
access comes as code fetches not as data

195
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,620
fetches so it never triggers the memory

196
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,300
firewall that's intended to prevent you

197
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,180
from reading out the uh program

198
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,280
now of course this is really labor

199
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,080
intensive you need a lab you need all of

200
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,360
this other stuff so the second half of

201
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,360
this report shows how there's a buffer

202
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,680
overflow

203
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,160
the incoming buffer a smart card packet

204
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,319
has a one byte knife so we have to 255

205
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,419
bytes

206
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:35,099
the incoming buffer is at the tail end

207
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:38,159
of RAM and RAM wraps around

208
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,399
so after the end of ram you have 32

209
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,260
bikes that are just nothing nothing is

210
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,760
mapped there if you write then nothing

211
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,740
happens if you read back it reaches zero

212
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,779
but after that we have another copy of

213
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:51,839
ram so by writing a long packet even

214
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,360
though like nothing shows up in the

215
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,519
memory map in the data sheet there's

216
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,519
actually Ram there and you can then

217
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,459
override It smash the return pointer on

218
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:06,300
the call stack and then have

219
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,580
return pointer you then have native code

220
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,420
execution in SRAM so I took this report

221
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,720
and I took a modern smart card reader

222
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,700
and USB smart card readers are very

223
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,500
different from the serial Port box

224
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,519
because

225
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,360
USB likes to have layers of abstraction

226
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,700
it you cannot receive an illegally long

227
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,740
packet on USB reader you cannot receive

228
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,300
a packet with bad checks on there are

229
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,060
all of these rules so I wrote fresh

230
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,100
Shell Code that is now compatible with

231
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,220
the modern Smart Car reader along with a

232
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,320
golang client so you can grab this go

233
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,880
Application build it on your Linux

234
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,680
Windows machine and in any USB smart

235
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,540
card reader you can dump a copy of all

236
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,339
of the firmware for this device or run

237
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:49,320
arbitrary shelf coaches providing it as

238
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,680
a string

239
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,440
about a year ago I got really bummed out

240
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,200
that I used to do invasive Hardware

241
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,779
attacks on microchips that I used to

242
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:03,240
boil them in acids photograph them and

243
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,060
so my buddy John McMaster here he nerds

244
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,560
typed me into building a full home

245
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,620
chemistry lab I can now do decapping I

246
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,959
can do delayering I can do etching of

247
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,740
implant ROMs which allows me to just

248
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,480
the difference between piece silicone

249
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,360
and silicon

250
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,660
and then I got uh

251
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,660
recursively nurse type into writing this

252
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,839
tool it's called Mastermind

253
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,480
this is an application in qt6 and C plus

254
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,839
that allows you to Mark rows and Columns

255
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:38,580
of

256
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,300
the ROM and then each little square

257
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,000
that's a red that's red or blue these

258
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,040
are the bits the blue ones are zeros the

259
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,680
red ones are ones and then you can

260
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,480
export this asciard whereas the raw

261
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,579
members there's been prior work in this

262
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:55,440
area like Adam Laurie who's around here

263
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,200
somewhere he wrote a tool called Rampart

264
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,240
which was the earliest public example it

265
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,240
was uh Chris kerinsky has a tool that

266
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,940
does it but this is modern and it is

267
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,980
fast and it lets you do things like

268
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,380
infinite zoom and design rule checks so

269
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,720
if you screw up in annotating this it

270
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,640
will tell you where you screwed up and

271
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,740
allow you to correct just that piece

272
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,540
it also runs on the command lines you

273
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,860
can do regression tests on your

274
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,600
annotations so if you're working on a

275
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,060
very big project you can

276
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,800
you know scripted in order to make sure

277
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,860
that you catch any mistakes

278
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,480
so that's what I'm working on but a

279
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,700
keynote is not supposed to be about your

280
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,200
technical projects it's supposed to be

281
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,300
about like life and society and all the

282
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,640
high pollution so I would like to invite

283
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,360
you

284
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,940
to meet my buddy Gordon

285
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,660
um last week was Gordon's birthday uh if

286
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,980
you could just say happy birthday to

287
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,720
Gordon or the camera

288
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,720
oh

289
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:56,160
um I met Gordon during the lockdowns in

290
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,779
2020

291
00:11:57,779 --> 00:11:59,880
um he joined my pup quiz team

292
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,160
and I don't mean a zoom pub quiz I live

293
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,160
in uh in East Tennessee and things are a

294
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,959
little different there

295
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:07,620
um

296
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,959
every Tuesday night we'd all hang out

297
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:12,420
we'd answer some questions he'd join our

298
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,820
table and Gordon is the happiest man

299
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,459
that I know

300
00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:18,540
we've checked it's not because of the

301
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,640
brain injury or anything like that

302
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,320
uh and it's not that he's naturally

303
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,060
happy the guy used to be a grumpy

304
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,420


305
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,440
um no one who knows him now believes

306
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,480
that but it is true

307
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,240
um we call him weatherman because every

308
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,320
time you

309
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,920
uh he'll he'll talk about the weather

310
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,100
and even if it's he will talk about

311
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,779
the nicest part about it he'll be like

312
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:44,519
yeah you know it

313
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,220
it rained for 40 days and 40 nights and

314
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,139
all the civilization was flooded and we

315
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:51,660
had to get on that boat and uh the

316
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,459
animal ship was everywhere but at the

317
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:58,399
end of it man like what a sunset laughs

318
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,839
um and

319
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:02,820
you know I've already mentioned that I

320
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,980
like Drive old cars and stuff

321
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,220
um this is my 1960s Studebaker champ

322
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,380
and this is Gordo with helping me out

323
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,240
with the bicycle pump we had to set up a

324
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,360
chain gang to pump up the rear tire when

325
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,639
it was too flat for us to get it to um

326
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:19,079
and we didn't have an electric one

327
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:19,830
around

328
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:23,119
[Music]

329
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,399
a few people know this but Gordon used

330
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,160
to be a nuclear engineer

331
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,200
um he did an entire career of this he

332
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,720
sent two children uh through college

333
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,180
this

334
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,239
um

335
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,639
he he trained himself for it you know

336
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:42,600
um

337
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,760
and every day as a nuclear engineer he

338
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,440
would go to an office building and he

339
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,720
would sit there and he'd um

340
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,339
yeah he wasn't lucky enough to sit by

341
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:52,440
the window you got a pretty high ranking

342
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,380
for that and he'd just sit there and he

343
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,420
was poured out of his mind he got sick

344
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,279
of staring at these spreadsheets you got

345
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,220
sick of having all of these meetings

346
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,260
the only thing he really enjoyed in this

347
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,760
field

348
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,680
um every now and then he'd get it to go

349
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,660
out to a construction site and see where

350
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,220
they were building stuff

351
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,620
um again for those of you who are too

352
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,300
young the United States of America used

353
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,100
to build nuclear reactors

354
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,360
um

355
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,800
so

356
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,260
after his kids were in college and after

357
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,180
they were able to support themselves and

358
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,980
stuff he said to hell with it and he

359
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,920
quit to do landscaping and now every day

360
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,959
he goes out into the sunshine

361
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,260
and

362
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:36,540
he works on a yard and by the end of the

363
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,980
day that yard looks better than when it

364
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,440
started and he comes to the bar with his

365
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,240
smile on his face and he hangs out with

366
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,380
a nice dog

367
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,440
and and he's happy

368
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,920
and the shame of it all is that if he

369
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,540
were a reverse engineer instead of a

370
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,160
nuclear engineer I think that he could

371
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,600
have continued his profession while

372
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,220
still being that happy

373
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,699
because as a nuclear engineer

374
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:00,800
um

375
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,699
well it's kind of like reverse

376
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:04,440
engineering in that if you do nuclear

377
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,240
Engineering in your garage you also get

378
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,899
to go to The Hague

379
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,639
oh

380
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,440
I mean the accommodations might not be

381
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,500
as comfortable but

382
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,040
um he can't he can't practice his craft

383
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,459
independently and he can't work on a

384
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:29,100
small problem because there are no small

385
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,380
problems in nuclear engineering there

386
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,540
are small pieces of big problems but

387
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,560
making sure that you know pipe number 97

388
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,300
uh has an appropriate thermal expansion

389
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,620
ratio

390
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,500
it becomes unfulfilling after a while

391
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,540
and he's not able to have this anxiety

392
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,760
that we can have in reverse engineering

393
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,459
he's not able to switch over to a new

394
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:52,920
project when the old one gets boring or

395
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,880
when the old one is finished

396
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,940
um back when I was a grum I made the

397
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,320
dumbass decision to move to New York

398
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,339
City once

399
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:05,160
twice talking about the second time I

400
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,300
should have learned my lesson the first

401
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,740
time

402
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,779
when I first started there it was a ton

403
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:12,540
of fun I got to do reverse engineering I

404
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,399
was I got to

405
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,899
um

406
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:18,060
to take apart an entire product line and

407
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,339
learn absolutely everything about it I

408
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:22,920
got to show up on a factory floor

409
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,160
and take apart everything on that

410
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,839
factory floor so that I could recreate

411
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,000
that factory elsewhere

412
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,680
um I learned some things that have still

413
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,740
scarred me I know dialects of fourth in

414
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,060
which integers are verbs

415
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,360
um

416
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,060
I got to reverse engineer the um

417
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,600
password authentication mechanism for uh

418
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,920
soldering up

419
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,660
and the password was oven

420
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,699
um I was told it was lowercase or maybe

421
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:55,380
the first letter was capitalized it

422
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,199
turns out the actual password

423
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:00,060
C and n

424
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,100
had to be

425
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,040
uppercase but the E could be uppercase

426
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,540
or lowercase

427
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,699
because the hashing algorithm which was

428
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:12,600
ripped off of planetsourcecode.com

429
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,880
had this thing where it would like hash

430
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,280
the stuff and then mask off the most

431
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,020
significant bit so that it wouldn't be

432
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,819
beyond the ASCII range

433
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:23,459
and then if it were in the bottom 32

434
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:27,839
bytes it would add 32 to the value and

435
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,400
32 is also the distance between

436
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,500
uppercase and lowercase numbers and

437
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,720
that's y collided

438
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,900
and you know

439
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,640
yeah it was a little wasteful to use an

440
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,640
item Pro licenses to figure out

441
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,400
why this works but it was a ton of fun

442
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,860
um and another great thing about that

443
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,400
was that I got to meet this fellow Jeff

444
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,440
Chapel

445
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,340
um

446
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,280
Jeff is an old school Windows reverse

447
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,039
engineer and at the time I knew nothing

448
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,840
about Windows but I had to learn it

449
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,980
quickly

450
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,919
quickly random Windows facts

451
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:07,380
um I had this this

452
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,340
um executable called the FW update.exe

453
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,660
and it required administrative

454
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,400
privileges

455
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,140
and I spent

456
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,299
I spent so much time trying to reverse

457
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:20,280
engineer why like which flag in my

458
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,140
linking script is making this thing

459
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,720
require administrative privileges then

460
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,600
the exact same code in a different

461
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,940
Island Target ran fine is an

462
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,500
unprivileged user

463
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,500
and the reason why is that in Windows

464
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,840
anything that includes update in the

465
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,760
executable name has to run as

466
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,960
administrator

467
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,880
foreign

468
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,919
there was no single bit inside of it I

469
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,299
also learned that

470
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:45,900
um

471
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,520
you know coming from a Unix background

472
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,400
this is absolutely insane

473
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,020
um in Windows you have different types

474
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,360
of executables or graphical and console

475
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,679
applications so

476
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,179
there's no way to have a command line

477
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:00,860
tool whereby providing a flag it might

478
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,600
you know run as a headless GUI or buy

479
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,880
another flag but then I don't think you

480
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,380
have to do separate executables for that

481
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,580
because there's a legit difference

482
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,179
um and Jeff was really really old school

483
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:15,900
um

484
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,720
he still has no cell phone uh if I want

485
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,360
to reach him I call his apartment and if

486
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,760
he does not answer his apartment I can

487
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,960
try uh the office of his main Consulting

488
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,960
client or I can if

489
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,960
if the it's dinner time I call his

490
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,539
neighborhood bar and uh when they pick

491
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:38,880
up I just say hey uh could you pass this

492
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,559
to the Dapper Australian fellow by the

493
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,539
bar with a fancy hat they'll say oh Jeff

494
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:44,940
sure here you go Jeff

495
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,620
and they actually hand him the cordless

496
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,419
phone to the bar like we were in the

497
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:50,100
1980s or something

498
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,620
he does his reverse engineering in text

499
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,840
files

500
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,640
he'll take his disassembler he'll

501
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,760
disassemble the file into a text file

502
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,380
and then he uses find and replace to

503
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,679
update the symbol names and he adds his

504
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,179
own comments to the side of it and when

505
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:07,440
you get the results of his reverse

506
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,360
engineering it is a perfectly commented

507
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,500
disassembly

508
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,840
or if he has more time he'll rewrite it

509
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,260
in Z and the C won't compile to be bite

510
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,120
perfect because he's not that particular

511
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,059
but it's pretty close

512
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:22,559
um

513
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,419
if you know of Jeff you probably know of

514
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:26,900
him through his website jeffchapel.com

515
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:31,320
at which he documents his uh

516
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,960
his reverse engineering

517
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,820
um while I was working with him I

518
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,000
trolled him into uh I kept teasing him

519
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,160
about different Windows things like um

520
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,840
in yeah this was in the Windows 7 era

521
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,640
units

522
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,220
and in Windows 7. if I have my command

523
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,400
line here and I want it to be taller

524
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,500
well I just drag it and it becomes

525
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,620
taller and I get more rows

526
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,960
and in Unix if I want it to be wider I

527
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,980
just drag it wider

528
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,660
you want it to be wider you need to

529
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,700
right click on the background go into

530
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,919
properties go into the third Pane and

531
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:12,240
then type in the number of columns you

532
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,940
want then click apply them okay

533
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,860
so I trolled him into patching con

534
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,559
hosts.dll so that I could drag the

535
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:22,320
command line wider on Windows 7.

536
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,539
and then I kept bragging about it every

537
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:27,360
time I ran into a Microsoft employee

538
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,539
and Windows 10 now supports dragging the

539
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,940
command line wider

540
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,320
so don't let anyone tell you that

541
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,220
trolling isn't useful

542
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,120
um

543
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,100
another piece of History

544
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,620
um for the kids in the audience there

545
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,059
used to be this thing called AOL instant

546
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:48,419
messenger and it used to matter socially

547
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:49,559
um

548
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:52,140
and when you come up with a new chat

549
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,780
Network you have this problem that no

550
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,340
one will use it because all of their

551
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,200
friends are on the old model

552
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,260
so Microsoft came out with MSN Messenger

553
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,700
which was the one on the left

554
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,159
and they had this great idea why not

555
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:06,900
just have the client connect to AOL

556
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,360
servers as well as Microsoft servers so

557
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,580
you can track people in either Network

558
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,299
so when you connect to MSN Messenger it

559
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:16,919
does not just connect to the Microsoft

560
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,780
server it also connects to the AOL

561
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,820
server

562
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,000
and AOL who is a little pissed because

563
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,880
this was a threat to their business line

564
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,620
uh never mind that they never made any

565
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,240
money off of this passenger it's the

566
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,240
principle of accounts so

567
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,159
there are a couple of ways that you can

568
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:36,600
do this

569
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,820
um one way is you can be very particular

570
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,860
about how your protocol is implemented

571
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,440
and you can recognize uh what's called a

572
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,500
parser differential in langsack which is

573
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,799
which basically means that if two

574
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:51,360
interpreters are written for the same

575
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,500
language

576
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,840
unless you put a lot of care into it

577
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,760
there will be differences between them

578
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,220
and if you and you can explain that

579
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,080
difference in order to remain compatible

580
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,360
with one while being incompatible with

581
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,140
another

582
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,120
or perhaps even making a message that

583
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,679
means one thing one parser and a

584
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,840
different thing to another person

585
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,360
um and this is useful for real world

586
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,059
experts for example

587
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:17,460
utf-8 allows you to have foreign

588
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,919
languages in strings without having to

589
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,720
configure every website and every

590
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,340
database server uniquely for that

591
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:26,400
language it is a big deal that we live

592
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,100
in an era in which I can have the

593
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,100
Turkish eye without the dot in

594
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,460
same file as the Hungarian o with the

595
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,200
two acute accents

596
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,179
and there was a time when that couldn't

597
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:41,400
happen

598
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,220
but as we standardized on that there are

599
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,059
still differences between

600
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:48,659
implementations of utf-8 for example you

601
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:50,760
can express the

602
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,260
you can express a single letter as

603
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,539
what's called an orphaned hair which is

604
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:56,100
where you have

605
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:56,940
um

606
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:00,120
you have it decoded to you to choose

607
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,880
16-bit UTF values that then form a

608
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,039
single character and most interpreters

609
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,919
do not allow this but some of them do

610
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:08,940
um

611
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,700
in any case

612
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,980
langsek did not exist in the 90s and no

613
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,900
one knew that partial differentials were

614
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,520
a good way to do this so what's another

615
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,520
way to do this well AOL had gotten this

616
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,559
bug report they were vulnerable to a

617
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,559
stock buffer overflow in aol's domestic

618
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:27,900
if you were the server the protocol name

619
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,940
is Oscar you were the Oscar server

620
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,559
which that would overflow the call stock

621
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,059
in the client

622
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:39,720
and this is a 32-bit Windows application

623
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,539
without any mitigations at all because

624
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:44,880
this was 1997.

625
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,980
so AOL

626
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,260
getting this bug report they realized

627
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,539
you know we couldn't fix this bug

628
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:52,980
or

629
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,539
we could send a memory corruption

630
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:56,880
exploit down to our own clients because

631
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,620
they will be vulnerable while the MSN

632
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,360
Messenger clients will not be and that

633
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,980
way we can do a survey in order to know

634
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,780
how many of our users are really running

635
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,159
a well instant messenger and how many

636
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:07,200
are running our competitors

637
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,600
Jeff was the one who reverse engineered

638
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,480
this and explained it to the world

639
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,520
um he also reverse engineered Windows

640
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,260
3.1

641
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,600
um the beta version of Windows 3.1 was

642
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,620
not compatible with uh VR dos

643
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,480
and that in itself is not a problem like

644
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,740
many pieces of software are not

645
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,000
complicated

646
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,919
with Jeff reverse engineered it and he

647
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:30,539
showed that the reason why it was not

648
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:32,580
compatible was that it was intentionally

649
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,400
incompatible they had written a check in

650
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,620
order to identify which Doss they were

651
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,640
running on

652
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,779
and

653
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:41,400
specifically broken compatibility with

654
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,500
Dr dos in order to push people back to

655
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,960
Microsoft Office

656
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,159
um

657
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,500
while I worked with him in New York

658
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,539
uh I had a blast I learned so many

659
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:53,460
different things

660
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,640
um and at that time I was pretty happy

661
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,559
he was not happy

662
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,799
because in his mind he was an author and

663
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:04,080
he was a reverse engineer and what he

664
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,360
wanted to do was to

665
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,120
make his life's work understanding the

666
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,799
infernal's windows

667
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,080
that's what he cared about

668
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,320
and prior to taking that job he had been

669
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,120
publishing rather regularly

670
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,159
like every month you would publish up

671
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,320
some notes different notes each month

672
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,000
different topics whatever he was working

673
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,940
on for the five years in which he worked

674
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,740
with that company he there were three

675
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,120
months in which she published anything

676
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,799
at all

677
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,840
and this really bummed him out

678
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,580
so for the final two years that I was

679
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,039
working with them every single day he

680
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:40,380
would announce his very last day of the

681
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,159
company

682
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:43,860
every single day he'd say you know

683
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,140
um and that this is in like 2014 so you

684
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,480
know January 2016 is coming up and I'm

685
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,940
out of here guys five year anniversary

686
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,860
I'm gone

687
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:56,159
and then January 2016 comes up and uh he

688
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,200
turns in his two weeks notice and his

689
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,520
manager is like what the hell Jeff we

690
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,900
need you here he's like I've been

691
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,679
telling you for two years

692
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,220
um

693
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,559
his his biggest gripe was not his

694
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,200
publication his biggest gripe is that he

695
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,500
couldn't find enough time of peace and

696
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,360
quiet and wish to do his work

697
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,760
so I think reverse engineering requires

698
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,860
that people not bother you and if you're

699
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,539
not the sort of person who can crank up

700
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:24,360
music really loud on headphones and

701
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,900
ignore the movement around you

702
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,880
it has an impact even if you are that

703
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,919
sort of person you know whether you can

704
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,260
keep a 32-bit pointer in your head or

705
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,820
you've got to kind of do like 16 minutes

706
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,640
at a time that makes a difference how

707
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,440
often your cash gets flushed and you

708
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,080
have to contact switch how

709
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,400
how else do you have a loud phone call

710
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,039
and keeps growing on as you're unable to

711
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,080
crank your volume loud enough before it

712
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,240
that has an impact

713
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,620
um if you're ever stuck in a large

714
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,299
corporation and you need to find peace

715
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:56,220
and quiet one trick that you can do is

716
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,320
there's often a database of the seating

717
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,140
arrangement and you can query this

718
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,240
database so you can write like a little

719
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,520
shell script or a web service that will

720
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,980
tell you which floor of the building has

721
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,440
the most empty desks and that will be

722
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,320
the floor that people are reorganizing

723
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,779
away from and then you can go there and

724
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:18,059
for about a week all the desks be empty

725
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:19,380
you just pick one set up with your

726
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,820
laptop you have a piece of quiet I'm

727
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,039
tired for you so

728
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,200
um I think it's uh Jeff works for the

729
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,299
desktop not from a laptop I mean he

730
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:28,440
wasn't able to make things like that

731
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,299
work so

732
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:32,220
um after providing his two years notice

733
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,279
and then his two weeks notice he leaves

734
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,779
and

735
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:39,600
um this is his publication record for

736
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,340
2016.

737
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,980
um this is an 11 month streak

738
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,860
and it continues into 2017.

739
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:50,340
and he had an absolute blast

740
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:54,360
um he now does Consulting so he's able

741
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,700
to work roughly half time and sort of

742
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,260
balance his work between interesting

743
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:01,620
client projects and interesting

744
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,260
personal projects for his website if you

745
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,880
need a Windows consultant hire him

746
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,460
because he is very good and he will only

747
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:11,520
take your job if it's interesting

748
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,919
which I like

749
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,320
um and I I really liked that job while I

750
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,059
was working with Jeff

751
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:18,899
um

752
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:21,960
but then uh I finished my big reverse

753
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,700
engineering project successfully I

754
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,520
delivered it and uh I saved the day and

755
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,640
everything went went great on that front

756
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,020
um so I got punished with another

757
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,820
project

758
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,260
and

759
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:37,440
um I this was also the time that uh

760
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,100
there was a big push

761
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,880
and

762
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,399
um

763
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:46,620
yeah uh I'm sorry I should have given a

764
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,539
trigger warning before showing the slide

765
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:50,279
um if you're covering your eyes now

766
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:53,059
you'll want to keep them peppers

767
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:59,159
so like this kind of makes sense if

768
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:00,899
you've got like a sweatshop of java

769
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:03,240
programmers working together on the same

770
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,100
code base

771
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,740
um this is a lot less effective if you

772
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,659
if you if your software is organized in

773
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:11,580
different ways if your visas are further

774
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,500
apart from each other

775
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,100
um

776
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:18,020
there is no reason why the

777
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,460
engineer working on the battery lifetime

778
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,980
of an embedded system needs to hear

779
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:27,419
about the color of the font in the

780
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:29,460
windows view of the same product

781
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,980
these people can happily not be in the

782
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,059
same meeting

783
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:35,640
and I got stuck in one of these things

784
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,440
every morning you see on the right where

785
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,200
it says daily scrum 15 minutes where it

786
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,539
says 15 minutes it means 90 minutes

787
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:44,760
this was every morning of my life for

788
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,799
many months from 9 30 until 11 o'clock

789
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,480
and suffering through this for an hour

790
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,460
and a half each morning at 11 o'clock

791
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,440
how much gumption do you have do you

792
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,059
imagine any of us had to get a damn

793
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:58,559
thing done

794
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,600
enough to get anything done before lunch

795
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,059
absolutely not so you got a coffee break

796
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:04,620
after

797
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,399
um

798
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:09,120
I I I don't smoke but I I'd go out for a

799
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,679
smoke break too

800
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:12,899
um and then then it's lunch time and

801
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:15,419
then after lunch you need another coffee

802
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:17,520
um this one meeting basically killed the

803
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,100
productivity of maybe 15 senior

804
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,980
Engineers for every morning every day of

805
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,279
the week

806
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,179
um what we would do in the meeting

807
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:29,340
because uh in theory you're supposed to

808
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:32,760
do stand up so uh I was asked to stand

809
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,340
up uh get up I'm like okay so there's a

810
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,860
talent agent and uh this family goes

811
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:41,479
into the talent agent his mother father

812
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,559
um I'm not gonna finish that joke here

813
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:46,980
but uh what we did instead was we

814
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:51,120
updated uh kanban board in Europe and we

815
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,620
spent an hour and a half watching these

816
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,520
boxes move around

817
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,020
and um it

818
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:01,260
it was miserable so during that

819
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,220
um

820
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:06,059
I had this uh the middle school that I

821
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:07,320
went to

822
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,779
um we had separate literature and

823
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:11,640
composition classes my literature

824
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,980
teacher Mrs Pittman

825
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,200
um she taught us that if we were bored

826
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,880
in a classroom we could do whatever the

827
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,980
 we wanted as long as it was quiet

828
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,919
it didn't bother anyone else

829
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,500
uh her suggestion was that we read and

830
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,059
that worked out well but I didn't have

831
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:29,159
any novels with me

832
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:32,539
um what I did have was my wristwatch

833
00:32:32,539 --> 00:32:35,399
so I took it apart during the meeting

834
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:36,659
I'm going to put it back together and I

835
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:37,799
took it apart and put it back together

836
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:39,600
and I

837
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,960
I I

838
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,899
it was it was pretty miserable so I I

839
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:48,480
quit too just like Jeff did I put in my

840
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,120
two weeks notice I handed off all of my

841
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,080
files

842
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,940
um when you're hired to reverse engineer

843
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,200
something

844
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,559
um you very often see the very worst

845
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:00,419
documentation in a company and I was

846
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:02,039
very careful not to leave the same thing

847
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:04,679
like I got all my notes in order I got

848
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:08,100
all my files uh you know I had a hard

849
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,980
disk that I labeled Travis's do not

850
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,779
throw away

851
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:15,299
all of that out and I went to human

852
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:17,480
resources to do like my next interview

853
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,200
exit interviews are wild because

854
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,940
you basically like work half of that day

855
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,919
and then you get called up to the HR

856
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,899
floor and you go in you sit down and you

857
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:30,659
have this meeting and they're like why

858
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:32,399
are you leaving I'm like because it

859
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,580
sucks

860
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:36,320
um

861
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,000
after the back and forth though

862
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,559
um they ask you if you have any final

863
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,260
questions which is oddly like a job

864
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,660
interview itself right so

865
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,080
[Music]

866
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,039
um

867
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,019
I said yeah

868
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:50,279
um

869
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:53,159
I heard this story that some guy lost

870
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:54,899
his a few years ago and went

871
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:56,760
swimming in the koi pot on the sixth

872
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,559
floor

873
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,480
heard that he still works here is that

874
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,720
true

875
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,760
she was expecting me to ask about like

876
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,619
the health insurance or something like

877
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:11,940
that

878
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,580
see she takes a moment Still Still

879
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,918
composed you know I'm sure people have

880
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:18,540
said weirder stuff and she looks me

881
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,460
right in the eye and she says

882
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:24,440
are you thinking about that right now

883
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,359
so let's be honest I'm not gonna do it

884
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,500
both thinking about it

885
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,960
um and then after after your exit

886
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,520
interview right after you hand over like

887
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,639
your credit card and your badge

888
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,440
all of that stuff uh you just sort of

889
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,520
walk out of the building and then you

890
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,260
have zero responsibilities

891
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:46,139
I mean except for like uh rents and

892
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:48,480
taxes and that solution

893
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,300
um and I was expecting to regret this

894
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,560
decision or maybe have some second

895
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,719
thoughts and maybe worry about the

896
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,339
shitload of money that I was losing by

897
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:59,960
quitting before bonuses and I didn't

898
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,720
he said what I did was I went back to

899
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,280
that watch

900
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,780
and

901
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,440
um

902
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,839
if you look at this

903
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,960
um there are these uh zebra stripes

904
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,000
along the um

905
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,400
along the PCB one for the LCD and one

906
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,680
for the keypad and

907
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,780
um there's like a little zebra connector

908
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,339
that goes between

909
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:25,020
them if you make another circuit board

910
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,060
in the same size and shape

911
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:30,060
connectors you can reuse the Plastics

912
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,940
and mechanical manufacturing of the

913
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,540
right

914
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,300
and the irony is not lost on me that

915
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,920
um you know I quit a job making a

916
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,020
battery-powered embedded system with an

917
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,640
LCD because I didn't believe that it

918
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,200
would ship and then I immediately went

919
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,780
to the bar and designed a different one

920
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,099
um

921
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:53,220
so I I sat down and I measured all of

922
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,960
the different connectors

923
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,359
um there are some tricks to this like

924
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:58,500
um

925
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,540
if you try to use your micrometer to

926
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,980
measure the distance between any two

927
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,839
pins when they get the small you'll have

928
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,760
a lot of error so instead you just count

929
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,900
them and you measure the distance

930
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,820
between the furthest pins and in that

931
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,760
way you can get a more accurate

932
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,760
um there's also the problem that the

933
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,359
watch chip has an LCD controller that is

934
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:21,119
designed just for that LCD whereas your

935
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,440
substitute chip will need to be

936
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,760
something that you can order in small

937
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,180
quantities

938
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:28,200
um so you can use little sticky notes in

939
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,900
order to cover individual pins of the

940
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,740
LCD connector to sort of mock up which

941
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,740
cells would be drawn on the old watch as

942
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,119
you're designing the new watch before

943
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,700
your prototype arrives

944
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,859
um here on the left is my first

945
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:46,079
functional prototype on the right is the

946
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,000
manufacturer's original

947
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,900
um

948
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,760
or take a couple of things about this

949
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,440
like I don't have the curved edges yet

950
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,700
[Music]

951
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,220
my early firmware had atrocious battery

952
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:59,400
life but this works

953
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,859
um here are the same things in x-ray

954
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:03,119
um

955
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,300
the it is so cool to just be able to set

956
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:09,060
these in the X-ray and photograph it now

957
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,520
um I love being an adult

958
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,780
um

959
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,640
so this is the chip that I used it's the

960
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,440
chipped on 430

961
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,780
f6147

962
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:22,140
um same firmware also works in the 6137

963
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,960
in case like uh level supply lines get

964
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,220
screwed over and suddenly we have to

965
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,560
establish parts to be done

966
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,359
um the cool thing about this chip if you

967
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:31,500
look at the bottom you can see those

968
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,619
little lollipop inductor structures this

969
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,780
chip not only has an image 30

970
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:39,660
microcontroller and voltage regulators

971
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:44,040
and the LCD controller built in it also

972
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,560
has a built-in subjects radio so you can

973
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,420
receive and transmit in this chip

974
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:53,700
I solder it all together I get the thing

975
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,960
functioning

976
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,200
um the one on the left is connected to a

977
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,180
uart built out of an old good fat

978
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,339
running into a laptop

979
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:04,740
I can recognize this by the counter this

980
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,859
is a beer bar in Manhattan

981
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:08,700
um

982
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:13,200
and every day I would go to this coffee

983
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,940
house drop a girl on East 66th Street

984
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,220
and I'd sit down and I would just write

985
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,380
the firmware for this and about four

986
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,480
o'clock I was finished and I felt so

987
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,940
damn good

988
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,560
um I mean I still lived in a of

989
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,240
a city uh there were still rats

990
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,400
everywhere but aside from the rats I had

991
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,560
a pretty good back then

992
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,200
um I felt later prototypes with the uh

993
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,640
you know I'm still trying to figure out

994
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,500
the right way to do an antenna

995
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,940
um if you meet me later on you'll see

996
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,579
the one that I'm wearing I've got

997
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:43,740
um like a coiled antenna by the side and

998
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,119
uh the ground plane is in the wrong

999
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,700
position but I'm getting closer the

1000
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,740
trouble with this design is that the uh

1001
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,480
yeah a ton of flexes

1002
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,240
and anything that flexes that much while

1003
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,920
bending the copper back and forth will

1004
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,780
snap

1005
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,520
this particular antenna will only last

1006
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,380
for a month or two where before it falls

1007
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,940
apart

1008
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,579
um I added applications to it so this

1009
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:09,599
app is the hex editor showing the

1010
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,780
real-time clock control register at zero

1011
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,220
one six e

1012
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,260
you'll see that the one on the left the

1013
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,839
silver watch has a value of zero four

1014
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:21,240
zero zero and one on the right has a

1015
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,099
value of zero four zero two

1016
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:25,339
I took this out of office in Budapest

1017
00:39:25,339 --> 00:39:28,500
not having the equipment to connect the

1018
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,780
debugger to the watches what I brought

1019
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,520
two with me and one of them was keeping

1020
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,140
perfect time and one of them was running

1021
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,160
fast

1022
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,079
one that was running fast had the two

1023
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:39,000
bit set and from the data sheet in the

1024
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,560
background on the laptop I was able to

1025
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,780
figure out that this was an error flag

1026
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,400
that I was not handling and I was able

1027
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,260
to adjust the code composite

1028
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,980
um in case I've ever stuck in another

1029
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,420
hour and a half long scrum meeting

1030
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,579
there's also a disassembler built down

1031
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:56,280
so I can disassemble the firmware of the

1032
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,720
watch from the screen of the watch

1033
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,359
um there's a carry wave transmitter so

1034
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,060
again if I'm stuck in that same scrum

1035
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:09,119
meeting I can send an SOS call by 70

1036
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,260
centimeters

1037
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,839
uh local ham radio operators are

1038
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:14,880
listening they can show up mobility

1039
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,839
scooters and help me out

1040
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:20,339
um it's also got a frequency counter and

1041
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:22,500
this is really handy like

1042
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,900
um the power of doing a carry wave

1043
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,640
transmission it's like there's a demo

1044
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,160
where a joke or something but being able

1045
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,040
to count the frequency of a transmitter

1046
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,740
from my wrist without having any extra

1047
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:37,500
equipment is really handy it means that

1048
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,119
if I'm at an event I can just hang out

1049
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,800
next to the security guard wait for him

1050
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,480
to transmit and then know what the

1051
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,940
channel is where the security radius

1052
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,440
problems

1053
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,300
um you'll see that it's off by a little

1054
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,940
bit I'm doing this technique where um

1055
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,200
because like it's not a software-defined

1056
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,420
radio I can't do uh past Fourier

1057
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,820
transform and then just pick e instead

1058
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,500
what I have to do is I have to slide

1059
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,480
with the narrow filter through the

1060
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,060
different frequencies and then look to

1061
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,560
see which one has the highest perceived

1062
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,540
signature

1063
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,380
um

1064
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,660
I also built a page of receiver for

1065
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:13,560
popsack so you can send a page from your

1066
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,599
cell phone through an amateur radio

1067
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:19,200
tower to the watch and then see the

1068
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,180
Asian watch I added remote control for

1069
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,619
these cheap little relays that you can

1070
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:28,040
buy on online

1071
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,140
and then

1072
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:35,000
a firefighter in Nevada

1073
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,619
W7 AMG

1074
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:39,180
he sent me

1075
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:39,900
um

1076
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:43,020
pull request that adds the transmitter I

1077
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,579
use the most

1078
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:46,820
you'll see these

1079
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,920
jukeboxes all around the states in

1080
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,260
really trashy bars and again Waffle

1081
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,820
Houses

1082
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:56,220
um if you've not had a waffle house when

1083
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,140
you next visit America please go as an

1084
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,599
experience they're open 24 hours a day

1085
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:03,540
including during hurricanes

1086
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,480
um I'm not joking our uh in the same way

1087
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,240
that there's like the Richter scale and

1088
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,520
the f scale for national disasters

1089
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,980
there's the Waffle House Index

1090
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,140
if more than two waffle houses are close

1091
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,300
or close state

1092
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,680
like there's probably a military

1093
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,200
Invasion or a very serious national

1094
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,960
natural disaster these things can run

1095
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,060
without electricity

1096
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:30,380
have their own gas reserves

1097
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:33,900
and they have these jukeboxes but when

1098
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,820
you have a jukebox in whether it's in a

1099
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,160
bar or in a Waffle House people disagree

1100
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,400
about the music for example my buddy

1101
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,599
Torsten

1102
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:44,099
went to one of these in Needles

1103
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:46,740
California and he loaded that Bananarama

1104
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:49,380
Hair Commercial song I'm your Venus I'm

1105
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,760
your father thing

1106
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,960
um

1107
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:56,660
16 times followed by no I didn't know

1108
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:59,040
in the original German which he was

1109
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,260
singing along in syllable by syllable

1110
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,180
just to remind the entire bar which

1111
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,619
 played the hair commercial song

1112
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:05,640
all the time

1113
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,859
to work around this the bartender has a

1114
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:09,900
remote control that can turn the Jukebox

1115
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,540
off or skip a paid song and the watch

1116
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:16,520
now has that same ability

1117
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:18,900
um

1118
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,180
in any case

1119
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,619
um

1120
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:25,079
when things are not going well when you

1121
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:26,579
find that you've had five years without

1122
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:29,040
publication and you find that you're not

1123
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,160
enjoying your work you can fix that and

1124
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,780
you can fix that either inside of the

1125
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,359
company or outside of the company you

1126
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:38,099
by um

1127
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:40,020
lowering a ton of money on a home x-ray

1128
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,060
machine and some chemistry equipment or

1129
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:44,520
you can fix it by buying a 30

1130
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,800
development kit and sinkering around it

1131
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,740
into the coffee house weekend but do fix

1132
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,560
it and do not allow yourself to fall out

1133
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,720
of reverse engineering in the same way

1134
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,000
my buddy Gordon as happy as he is fell

1135
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,560
out of their instrument

1136
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,540
because reverse engineering is a

1137
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:01,680
shitload of fun

1138
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,160
and it feels good and

1139
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,319
you're in it for a reasonable

1140
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:09,500
so don't fall out

1141
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,640
and so

1142
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,319
yeah

1143
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:16,500
enjoy the sunset have some fun and share

1144
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,240
reverse engineering

1145
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,839
thank you

1146
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:26,819
thanks Travis

1147
00:44:26,819 --> 00:44:29,579
for really inspirational speech and uh

1148
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:31,800
no tell me that all those people who use

1149
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,980
iPads for programming are we it uh do we

1150
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:38,359
have any questions from the audience

1151
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:51,540
not an older guy myself

1152
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:54,060
are were you inspired Anyway by the

1153
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,099
psycho watches that already had like

1154
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:59,099
radio things in them uh no actually I

1155
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:01,880
was inspired by the ti Kronos watch

1156
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,520
which was a development kit yeah maybe

1157
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,760
like 2008 2009 the trouble with your

1158
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,960
parents watch was that it was

1159
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,780
horrifically uncomfortable to wear

1160
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:13,920
and

1161
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,780
um TI used to have a developers

1162
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,020
conference each year which was

1163
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:21,300
absolutely amazing it was like nine

1164
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,099
parallel tracks they were just telling

1165
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:25,680
you how to build ship and the only part

1166
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,240
about it that was corporate propaganda

1167
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:30,420
was that coincidentally uses Texas parks

1168
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:33,480
and at that conference I met some guys

1169
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,960
from meta watch which was start up the

1170
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,700
forked out of fossil

1171
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:41,280
and they were explaining to me that it

1172
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,800
doesn't matter how cool the Chronos

1173
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,200
watch is from the development angle

1174
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,980
that they expected it to fail because it

1175
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,440
was uncomfortable to wear

1176
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:56,040
and that if the

1177
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,740
if you're making a wearable it first has

1178
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:01,140
to be comfortable and then it has to

1179
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:02,400
look cool

1180
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,079
and if you don't get those two things

1181
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,060
right it will sit in a drawer and no one

1182
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:07,380
will wear it and it will not be a

1183
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,220
product

1184
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:13,020
and so looking at the Casio watch which

1185
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,700
is a successful watch she's comfortable

1186
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,520
to wear it's cool in at least some areas

1187
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,380
uh

1188
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,420
I realized that if I could fit that same

1189
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:23,579
chip into that package that I would be

1190
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:27,180
able to get the comfort and the style

1191
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:30,240
from Casio for free

1192
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,819
and then also have the electronics

1193
00:46:32,819 --> 00:46:34,020
advantage

1194
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:36,359
of being able to run my own code

1195
00:46:36,359 --> 00:46:39,300
and do the imme as well

1196
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,940
um the Iron Man The girl Tech IMA was a

1197
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:43,319
children's toy for those of you don't

1198
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:45,480
know which uses the same radio as this

1199
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:49,440
watch and um it is not very stylish and

1200
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,060
it is not very comfortable to carry but

1201
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,400
it is so cool and so connected

1202
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,920
and by the way that firefighter I

1203
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,900
recognize the goal sign is a really

1204
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:01,079
awesome dude he is yes

1205
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:04,700
thanks any other questions

1206
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,300
no questions so give it another round of

1207
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,920
applause please

1208
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:14,300
it's Travis good speed
