1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,899
so hello everybody I hope that you had a

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,059
good lunch and a good cup of coffee you

3
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:10,679
will need it not just for this stuff but

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,300
for the upcoming ones

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,700
anyway you're reverse Engineers here

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,660
right so you should be able to handle so

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,520
um brief introduction about myself so

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,439
during the day usually I'm working as

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,660
director of zetty cyber security lab in

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,279
Rome and in the night I'm usually

11
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,680
breaking or making Hardware stuff

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,260
depending on the mood and on the day uh

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,759
disclaimer the content of this

14
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,079
presentation is the result of an

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,660
independent research so please don't

16
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,059
blame my previous and the actual Empire

17
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,339
or the upcoming sites thank you

18
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:46,020
um so first of all as the title in the

19
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,820
first slide in the opening we are

20
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,140
talking about physical Access Control

21
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,539
Systems in particular biometric Ones

22
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:54,660
based so just to give you a a an initial

23
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,699
overview of the ones of the types of

24
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:59,820
biometric based physical access control

25
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,280
system we have actually in the market we

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,539
can differentiate depending on the

27
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:06,060
sensor that is used in them the most

28
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,860
common of course are fingerprint that

29
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,260
are widely deployed nowadays in multiple

30
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,420
realities from corporate environments to

31
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,420
different ones then we have some others

32
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,920
that are less common in corporate

33
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,619
environments and More in more advanced

34
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,180
environments like you know military ones

35
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,159
or specific you know industrial lower

36
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,680
plants or something like that like Ira

37
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,540
scanner or retinal scanners then we have

38
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,220
the official ones that usually are not

39
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,979
the most accepted widely from privacy

40
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,140
point of view the perception of the

41
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,520
violation of the Privacy point of view

42
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,320
and then we have voice scanners and of

43
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,600
course hand related scanners actually

44
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,460
here I put n geometry but there are two

45
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,960
types as you can see in the next Slide

46
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,240
the main two

47
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,640
um hand-based biometric access control

48
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,680
systems are using two different sensors

49
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,140
the hand vein technology one which is a

50
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,880
technique of biometric identification

51
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,979
through the analysis of the patterns of

52
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:58,439
blood vessels visible on the surface of

53
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,820
the skin by using you know different

54
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,579
type of lengths of light like you know

55
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,259
infrared and so on and so forth and

56
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,439
based on the the the the combination the

57
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,720
structure of these veins blood vessels

58
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,080
on on your hand we can create a very

59
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,780
well unique pattern or so to speak sort

60
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,720
of hash right the other one is the hand

61
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,120
geometry is the longest implemented

62
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,340
biometric type because actually this

63
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,920
kind of Technology was already used at

64
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,959
the end of 80s surprising I didn't know

65
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,000
that but I discovered later on actually

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,360
all these uh let's say research

67
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,239
hobby research was started because one

68
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,520
day I was visiting a factory plant of

69
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,620
where a friend of mine was working and I

70
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,560
noticed that uh during in in the factory

71
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,660
line the production line instead of

72
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,480
using the classic us fingerprint sense

73
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,519
uh well sensors and access control they

74
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,980
were using this strange device where you

75
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,099
put your hand and I was like why such

76
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:57,720
thing I thought at the beginning I

77
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,400
thought because of the need of higher

78
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,080
security actually it was the opposite

79
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,660
because we see later on that this kind

80
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,420
of sensors are not as precise as the

81
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,879
latest versions of fingerprint sensor

82
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,560
like capacitive days to fingerprint

83
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,480
sensors so they they give you a certain

84
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,840
grade of security but not as as secure

85
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,300
as other type of biometric systems

86
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,819
anyway how it works the hand geometry

87
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:23,519
just to give you an idea of you know of

88
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,680
how what is the technology behind that

89
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,420
well first of all the sensor is a sort

90
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,720
of camera which once you insert your

91
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,180
hand on this device on a plate guided

92
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,379
plate actually

93
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:37,800
which will make position your hand in a

94
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,220
very specific Position will acquire a

95
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,620
image of your of your hand from

96
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,659
different point of views so from the

97
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,819
from the top and from the sides to the

98
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:51,360
help of uh some angle mirrors so once

99
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,400
this image the Silhouettes of your hand

100
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,060
is acquired uh 31 000 points are

101
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,519
analyzed and 90 measurements are taken

102
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,459
the measurements can be example for

103
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,500
example the length of the fingers

104
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,780
distance between the knuckles of your

105
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,780
hand the height the thickness the width

106
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,159
of hand and each finger so the idea is

107
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,680
that after the acquisition and all these

108
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,440
measurements process uh what is the the

109
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,720
output of all these all these

110
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,580
enrollments if it's the first time you

111
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,919
enroll your hands with this device it's

112
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,759
a nine bias array which can which is

113
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,000
used in manuals and is called as also is

114
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,340
also known as Hampton Bay it so it's

115
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,560
sort of again it's a sort of hash we

116
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,720
will see later on that he's not

117
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,080
um is is not as precise as a real hash

118
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,360
because there is some sort of scoring so

119
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,820
every time you insert you after you

120
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,620
enroll the first time your hand and the

121
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,199
specific hand template is created every

122
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:55,259
time you need to enter again this well

123
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:58,500
you need to to scan again your hand uh

124
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,979
once acquired the the newly entered hand

125
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:04,500
and it will create a new template and

126
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,960
then try to compare the two templates so

127
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,960
there is a score from 0 to 100 the lower

128
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,960
is the score it means that the closest

129
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,900
is the the closest are the two acquired

130
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,160
hands

131
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,160
so in this case there is some certain uh

132
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,979
level of uh you know degree of Freedom

133
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:25,919
uh from each acquisition why because as

134
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,539
it was designed to be used in

135
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:30,240
environments like uh so to speak dirty

136
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,919
environments or polluted environments

137
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,900
like you know imagine like a factory

138
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,300
where workers in the product line they

139
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,820
use Factory line they use gloves so in

140
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,520
theory they can still use the gloves

141
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,580
while wearing the gloves while trying to

142
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,919
you know access that part of the of the

143
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:49,199
building so that's why there is that

144
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,360
certain degree of freedom and we can use

145
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,340
that to exploit from you know physical

146
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,900
security point of view these kind of

147
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,320
devices where are used mainly these uh

148
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,539
these kind of physical access control

149
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:02,820
system or block timing because time

150
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,340
clock or hand file or um yeah hand

151
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,960
punches

152
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,060
um usually Healthcare industrial site

153
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,220
chemical plants food manufacturing

154
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,560
airport

155
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,120
airports in the past I found an interest

156
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,820
some information about some airports

157
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,500
around the United States that were using

158
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,240
these in the past of course for obvious

159
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,660
reason luckily for for demo for us they

160
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,120
got replaced with higher security types

161
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,680
of you know biometric Access Control

162
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,600
Systems like the physical the

163
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,819
the fingerprints were you know retina or

164
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:35,819
eye related biometric system so just to

165
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:37,860
give you an idea I found online like for

166
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,080
example this tweet from this chemical

167
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,419
manufacturer that was even uh you know

168
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,100
promoting the fact that they installed

169
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,440
these kind of devices on their

170
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,720
facilities so that you know not not I

171
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,520
mean good or scene but you know that

172
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,280
that upset because then it pushed me

173
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,740
even further to eventually buy a couple

174
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,240
of them and start you know working on

175
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,280
that so the target is this device is

176
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,500
called hand key or hand punch in theory

177
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,020
the type the the type of device is

178
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,800
called hand punch and practically is uh

179
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,780
actually it's quite expensive compared

180
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,539
to other types of access systems you can

181
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:14,639
find around and

182
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,400
um but still I was motivated enough So

183
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,960
eventually on eBay actually you can

184
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,419
still find some of them on eBay so if

185
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:23,759
you want to play around yeah there are

186
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,460
still some around and eventually I ended

187
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,199
up buying a bunch of them on eBay the

188
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,180
sad part is that they were the dismissed

189
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,639
one from from you know real scenarios so

190
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,400
they didn't have uh the real the the

191
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,919
locks so they were just closed and you

192
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,620
know they didn't have manuals they

193
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,560
didn't have softwares so I went like in

194
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,840
a very black block Black Box approach on

195
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,639
on you know trying to first of all

196
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,259
setting them up so the first

197
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:51,240
vulnerability that was obvious once it

198
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,400
arrived was the fact that from physical

199
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,800
so it in the next slide you will see the

200
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,360
a different approach so physical

201
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,280
security approach started from the very

202
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,960
beginning like you know the lock itself

203
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,780
that is opening the entire device and we

204
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,780
used to later trying to upon my control

205
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,259
hands to see how the sensor is uh how

206
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:11,880
secure is the sensor and I'm going to

207
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,139
see from Network on computers

208
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:15,060
engineering and so forth so starting

209
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,099
from physical security point of view the

210
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:19,139
first thing obvious to any security guy

211
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:20,940
is the fact that they are using a

212
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,280
tubular bot or 80 percent the liberal

213
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,740
lock is a failure so from my point of

214
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,300
view if I would have to protect some

215
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,520
physical access of this type

216
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,458
knowing that probably after opening the

217
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:33,899
device I will have access to the

218
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,059
motherboard of the device and be able to

219
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,099
control the relay of the electronic lock

220
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:41,458
that is connected nearby classic you

221
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,779
know environment structure

222
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:44,700
infrastructure of a physical access

223
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,740
control system I would have used

224
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,080
something like a higher

225
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,660
highly secured type of lock like you

226
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,660
know those high level supplies once for

227
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,600
example but anyway uh tubular lock what

228
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,640
it means it just means that you know

229
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,260
security throughout security compared to

230
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,540
a classic pin tumbler law so here what

231
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,540
you need is just either a tubular lock

232
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,760
tension wrench and the needle push back

233
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,680
the pins and try to open the lock or

234
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,660
just a classic

235
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,560
um

236
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,920
a popular lock pick like in the image

237
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,940
there is like that up there or the third

238
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,100
option was Googling because I'm a lazy

239
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,100
guy and uh even this is a picker in this

240
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,320
case so I just checked around if there

241
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,959
was some sort of you know key I can you

242
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,779
know uh I I can like uh ask the

243
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:36,420
manufacturer to remake giving them some

244
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,100
code usually sometimes happens like that

245
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,320
eventually I ended up finding a

246
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,380
interesting thing all these devices not

247
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,180
just this model that was the hand key

248
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,000
too but all the lines of these kind of

249
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,279
devices from this manufacturer had in

250
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:53,640
common one single master key so you just

251
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,380
need to buy one and you can open all of

252
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,779
them everywhere anywhere so that was

253
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:01,140
already a failure that's why I mentioned

254
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,880
in the title pitfalls because this was

255
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,920
just the beginning of the of the journey

256
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,040
so once you open pop open the device on

257
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,959
the back of the device you see some

258
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,399
interesting information about the

259
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,080
penthouse which is always good then you

260
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,820
don't need even the manual so at that

261
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,100
point at this point I didn't have manual

262
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,399
lower software so I my journey continued

263
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,380
by the time so at this point what I

264
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,060
realized is that there was first thing

265
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,100
first usually when you do some red team

266
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,080
engagements or you have access or

267
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,480
physical security audits you always

268
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,060
check the physical access control system

269
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,940
for anti-tamper switches so this one is

270
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,860
another vendor another device is a

271
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,080
reader the point is that usually there

272
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,480
are anti-tamper switches and 90 percent

273
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,760
of the times I checked during some real

274
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,459
engagements they they're never used so

275
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:49,079
that's already a failure but the filler

276
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:50,760
is not from the vendor but it's from the

277
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,640
whoever implemented the the the this

278
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,140
physical access control system in that

279
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,480
specific video so just going back to

280
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,940
this device uh as you can see there is

281
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,279
no mention anywhere any anti-tamper

282
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:04,680
device so I went I tried to check deeper

283
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,660
on the motherboard and effectively there

284
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,160
was no Under Numbers which this is

285
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,560
already a failure for this kind of you

286
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,060
know devices that are used also as

287
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,279
physical Access Control Systems so

288
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,260
anytime you open with the Master Lock

289
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,660
one of these devices there will not be

290
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,180
an alarm triggered remotely to the

291
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,000
security guard's room so you can

292
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,459
eventually tamper you can do things

293
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:30,060
right in it so what's next well once you

294
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,100
open it you can notice different things

295
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,220
the first thing is the reset switch

296
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,399
the resets which allows you to do well

297
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,980
as it says a factory reset so what

298
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,680
happens when you press it is that you

299
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,079
delete all the data contained inside the

300
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,660
device itself so it forgets about all

301
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,300
the hands enrolled all the users even

302
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,640
the super admin user everything is lost

303
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,560
forever so in that case you just close

304
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,660
it up and it's sort of denial service so

305
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,420
one can login can access the door unless

306
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,519
the supervisor will come and you know

307
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:06,300
reset the I mean re-enroll himself as a

308
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,940
supervisor or super me loaded as you

309
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,920
want the second thing is that once you

310
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,200
make the you press the reset since you

311
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,120
deletes everything goes in factory mode

312
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,100
so with that factory mode then you can

313
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,140
enroll yourself as super admin just

314
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,140
decide your ID or pin code roll your

315
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,880
hands three times so scan your hands

316
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,260
three times and that's it then you can

317
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,240
enter by asserting the same thing for

318
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,519
the adjust enrolled your hands as well

319
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,980
as canned and that's it you're in there

320
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,019
is another way less suspicious and less

321
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,360
you know not it's not possible from you

322
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,240
know security guards or whoever holds

323
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,060
these physical access control system the

324
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,399
MacGyver style paper clip because as you

325
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,560
can see here uh it just need you know to

326
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,480
be able to read English actually if you

327
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,100
see here there is one pin in the

328
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,399
terminal called lock lock and D1 D1

329
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,920
stands for the data one bus or the vegan

330
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,079
because it's using also vegan you know

331
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,500
the usual all the from 1970s uh

332
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,300
vulnerable protocol of physical access

333
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,399
control system but in this case we care

334
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:08,100
about the first word block so what

335
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,500
happens is that just with a paper clip

336
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,360
and the master key of C that you can buy

337
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,700
for six dollars any of this device can

338
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,380
be popped open no alarm will be

339
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,519
triggered because there is no

340
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,980
anti-tamper

341
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,240
anti-tampers reach and then with the

342
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,980
classic you know Mega ever style paper

343
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,079
clip we can

344
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:28,320
uh we can trigger the relay that will

345
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,860
open the lock

346
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,560
so in this case yeah that's it perfect

347
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,200
thank you and um

348
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,019
yeah you just need to go down to ground

349
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:46,079
that pin and

350
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,579
the door will open

351
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:49,139
so that's

352
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:52,500
so all these set of things

353
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,500
is leading to you know you know

354
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,980
good times for red teamers out there

355
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,959
um so then the next approach passing

356
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,180
from you know reviewing different uh

357
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,740
different failures from physical point

358
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,480
of view from physical security point of

359
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,600
view I passed the next step sensor so in

360
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,360
this case I wanted to usually as I said

361
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,160
in at the very beginning in the intro

362
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,260
during the night I break things so

363
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,079
usually I like to break uh biometric

364
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:20,820
access control system fingerprints and

365
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,860
so on and sometimes you find some funny

366
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,959
things that's why I started in this case

367
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,639
with the Silicon hand attack I started

368
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,399
with a very dumb way of testing so I

369
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,320
thought let's see how stupid is the

370
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,600
sensor in this case or yeah

371
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,779
how how easy is possible to trigger you

372
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:39,779
know for a real positive so I started by

373
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,399
buying you know Halloween hands and

374
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:42,959
stuff like that but they failed

375
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,360
obviously luckily for the vendor and

376
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,120
then I tried to create scans of my 101

377
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,000
is basically one-on-one of my hands and

378
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,220
then try different thicknesses and

379
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,399
luckily uh all of them failed then I

380
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,380
wanted to step up a bit further and I

381
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,839
thought about 3D scanning so at the

382
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:02,399
beginning I started to investigate which

383
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,060
is the most cost effective way to get a

384
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:09,360
scan a 3D scan of a victim hand in a way

385
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,240
that is not just uh from research point

386
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,880
of view a lab controlled environment so

387
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,920
looking around there were some options

388
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,320
too expensive for my budget so then I

389
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,459
ended up with a five euro app from the

390
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:26,579
App Store so for iOS for Mobile iPhones

391
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:29,699
which is this trinio

392
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:32,459
GTR and io3d scanner app which

393
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:34,440
practically what it does you need just

394
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,260
need a lot of photos and videos of the

395
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,339
target hand

396
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:41,459
and then it is able to reconstruct in 3D

397
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:44,339
the acquired Target so in this case with

398
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:46,440
my control hand of course but this

399
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,540
already was you know I wanted to try

400
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,100
this tab before

401
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,260
the next slide would you see I did I did

402
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,500
another type of attempt but that needs

403
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,120
physical access to the Target hand which

404
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,980
is undoable in a rare case scenario so I

405
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,519
wanted first to try uh some middle way

406
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,380
so in this case this approach is still

407
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,260
feasible remotely as soon as you have a

408
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,180
lot of images and videos of the target

409
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,699
hand so in some cases it may be doable

410
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:14,100
you know in a real red team engagement

411
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,260
let's say a long run campaign of red

412
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,120
team engagement so the idea here was

413
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,279
that acquired a lot of photos and videos

414
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,839
with this app

415
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,480
um with the mobile phone then I fed this

416
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,760
mobile app with this with this photos

417
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,980
and videos and eventually

418
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:33,120
it created a 3D version of my control

419
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,300
hand and then what I did I fed inside a

420
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,000
cad designing tool in a way that I tried

421
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,800
to clean it up as move as much as I

422
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,720
could you know the imperfections and

423
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,360
then printed in with a 3D printer and

424
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,820
Pla and then I created a mold with

425
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,279
alginate in a way that uh from the

426
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:54,079
negative mold of my control hand scan 3d

427
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,959
hand I was able to pour inside a b

428
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:00,779
component silicone based compound which

429
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:03,420
allowed me to recreate my positive clone

430
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:07,380
of my cement clone of my hand action

431
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,919
well the results were not the best I

432
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:13,140
could have achieved but still again I

433
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,000
wanted to remark that I wanted to be as

434
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,640
lower budget as possible so the at the

435
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,819
at the end considering 50 attempts so I

436
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:23,339
tried 50 times to log in with these this

437
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,919
hand instead of my real one uh only two

438
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,679
times I succeeded so in this case if we

439
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:30,360
look from mythbuster point of view is

440
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,820
plausible

441
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:35,460
the reasons why uh is still acceptable

442
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,799
for me is that if I would probably

443
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:41,039
repeat with a higher quality acquisition

444
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,039
of of the hands like Medias like videos

445
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:46,380
and photos and probably use not these

446
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,860
five euro mobile app but some better you

447
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,200
know a position software probably I

448
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,940
would end it up with more successful

449
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,520
attempts so but still a lot as

450
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,820
mythbuster style plausible still one so

451
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,500
the next step was something that is

452
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,380
pretty unreliable in a real world I mean

453
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,679
to create this kind of mold higher

454
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,919
Precision mode one of my hand in Silicon

455
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:13,679
you need three minutes of the victim's

456
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,440
hand staying still so either you drag

457
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,620
him or you know so that so from from a

458
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,480
research point of view we can

459
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,919
demonstrate we will see later that we

460
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:24,539
can we can demonstrate that the sensor

461
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,700
can be bypassed from a red teamer point

462
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,140
of view if there is some red teamer here

463
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,539
will not say that this is undoable I

464
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:32,820
agree with you because it's the same

465
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,520
with the cloning fingerprints there are

466
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,919
some cases you can bypass from a lab

467
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,020
perspective point of view a fingerprint

468
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:43,860
sensor but from Opera from an

469
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,419
operational point of view is undoable

470
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:47,820
right so this is the same case so this

471
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,940
case is is pretty much successful well

472
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,059
it was successful uh like every time I

473
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:56,280
try to you know scan acquire the Clone

474
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,440
hand was working so I would say

475
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,260
uh 99

476
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:03,000
is successful because you know Murphy is

477
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,220
always there but you know every time I

478
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,960
tried I was always able to log in with

479
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,539
this so the idea is that

480
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:10,620
yeah

481
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,320
this is Jimmy we called it Jimmy in the

482
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,439
lab

483
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,600
and um yeah the the

484
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,280
you try to log in of course why I use

485
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,020
the Silicon base because you can you

486
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,419
know move the hands move the hand on the

487
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:25,860
on the plate

488
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:30,539
and we got a 79 percent score uh which

489
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:33,120
is as I said the lower this floor the

490
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,840
closest is the the newly acquired handle

491
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,240
with the initial one template so as you

492
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,580
can see here my hand is 35. yeah

493
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:46,559
is that the first time I acquired the

494
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,780
hand was like 79

495
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,660
so in theory the the sensor detects that

496
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,340
there are differences but they are

497
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,700
designed exactly to allow uh users of

498
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,220
these devices to have dirty hands like

499
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,780
imagine mechanics that they have you

500
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,940
know degrees blackberries on them or

501
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,860
scratches you know in case you get a

502
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,960
scratch when they you know instead of

503
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,760
being denied you just

504
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,860
have a sort of degree of you see in this

505
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,380
case was even 93 there the sport so we

506
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,320
barely passed because uh if you get more

507
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,260
than 9900 it would be denied so but

508
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,900
still from from that point of view it

509
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,720
works now now we reviewed from physical

510
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,419
security point of view from the sensor

511
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:29,880
security point of view then we pass

512
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,100
through the usual network security

513
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,960
because as you know physical access

514
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,120
control system usually in the past were

515
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,500
connected through RS 485 rs32 and

516
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,200
eventually they passed finally to TCP IP

517
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,660
based connection right so in this case

518
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,880
this device is similar is acting as

519
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,340
other physical Access Control Systems

520
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,620
once you connect to a network with the

521
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:56,100
HTTP it gets an IP and then eventually

522
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,900
what you do you scan with that map right

523
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,480
and eventually you will find this port

524
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,220
standard Port 301 open PCP which is

525
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,200
funny because it says the services you

526
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,660
know nmaps stores that as a necessary so

527
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,100
it was like oh

528
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:15,360
uh anyway so after a brief uh flooding

529
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,240
campaign to see how it was reacting the

530
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,179
device nothing fifth grade is zero it

531
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,220
was like you know he didn't care about

532
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,799
nothing there even though it was marked

533
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:27,900
as often because the DC handshake was

534
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,480
you know completed so after the TCP

535
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,760
handshake nothing was there I wasn't

536
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,580
able to get his reply any reply from the

537
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,980
device so I started to look around doing

538
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,080
some you know all scenes and Googling

539
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,659
around and eventually I thought for sure

540
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:44,580
there must be a software out there just

541
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,200
that they didn't receive it because I

542
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,299
bought used and this from a dismissed

543
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:50,940
building on eBay so looking around I

544
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,679
figured out there was this lovely tool

545
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:55,500
all hand punch admin and

546
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,980
um and already in the uh once you open

547
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,840
immediately you immediately see that the

548
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,700
port is already set preset and three

549
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,440
zero zero one so I thought okay it's

550
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,659
good direction so what I did I just

551
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:10,140
placed the IP of the device and press

552
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,539
test and the first you know it connected

553
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:15,659
the first thing I I thought is wait he

554
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:17,880
didn't ask me for passwords yet but they

555
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,080
thought okay it's just maybe just

556
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,880
because I press test is doing some sort

557
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,179
of magic you know wake up packets and

558
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:25,919
then just ping and the authorization

559
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,679
will be later on then I press like the

560
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:31,860
button pull all users and they already

561
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,600
had a couple of users they are set up

562
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,760
manually from the device itself always

563
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,340
with my hand but didn't matter much so

564
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,020
that they had different IDs and

565
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,220
different names just for single

566
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,280
information and eventually

567
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,440
uh it pulled without asking me any

568
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,500
password so I felt like what so maybe

569
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,020
maybe encrypted right and her

570
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,880
hardboarding inside the hand punch and I

571
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,059
thought wow that's bad so maybe half of

572
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:58,679
you would have already started the

573
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:01,140
gitral Ida Pro starting you know the

574
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,140
disassembling the executable let's see

575
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,940
assignment the easy reverse engineer I

576
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,919
started with the networking point of

577
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,960
view with a networking point of view and

578
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,880
try and errors a sniffing with Wireshark

579
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,520
I figured out the following so first of

580
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,600
all as soon as you press either

581
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,799
test

582
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:22,740
here or any other command here what it

583
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,799
does the device is uh from the the

584
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:28,380
software so the PC let's say it sends

585
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,679
this packet always the same to the

586
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,360
to the device so at that point I thought

587
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,679
interesting when I send only this device

588
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,260
this packet the device wakes up and

589
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,480
starts the you know to speak talk me

590
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,240
back so I I called it the wake up packet

591
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,460
right and it's always the same by trying

592
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,100
and retrying sending multiple times the

593
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,039
same uh type of buttons like the test

594
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,120
one in the in the in the in the in the

595
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,860
desktop application I was always getting

596
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,520
the same packet sent and the same reply

597
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,860
uh back so I infer that was some sort of

598
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,580
wake up magic packet and there that's it

599
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,740
the next packet though was even more

600
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,360
interesting because maybe I thought

601
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,100
maybe somewhere here there's some

602
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,380
recorded password still you know I

603
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,380
didn't have clear uh mind yet about that

604
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,120
but I continued you know with the next

605
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,679
package and the next practice showed me

606
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:23,700
another thing

607
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,340
and the uh the fact that once this

608
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,860
packet is always the same both packets

609
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,720
goes in in couple they are always sent

610
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,460
at a beginner at the beginning of every

611
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,400
uh every communication that is initiated

612
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,520
by the software version to the device so

613
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,280
the second packet reply was like Max

614
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,159
drive all in clear text and these HP for

615
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,440
blah blah and then I noticed that was

616
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,120
exactly what was written on the device

617
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,460
once you put it so it means that it's

618
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,620
some sort of affordable way we realize

619
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,820
that is

620
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:58,140
probably very sure uh very likely uh

621
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,940
plain text probable because we see

622
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,520
exactly so this is blue is what the hand

623
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,380
punch so what is the this device is

624
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:07,799
sending me back through TCP so the the

625
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,960
protocol is into your text we wouldn't

626
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,120
have manipulate somehow

627
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,580
and second thing doesn't look like there

628
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,740
is some sort of authentication screen

629
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,440
anywhere so I continued with you know

630
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,360
try and errors and actually I tried to

631
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,159
do some real actions like create new

632
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:24,840
user so in this case I created a new

633
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,840
user uh with a user ID or also pin code

634
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,340
because actually you need to insert that

635
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,320
you know ID pin code before scanning

636
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,720
your hand to get access to the you know

637
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,500
get past the hand punch so I created a

638
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,700
new ID uh user 686 and then I named that

639
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,679
user hacker

640
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,200
so then here I sniffed again so the

641
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,299
first packet is always the way the usual

642
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:50,279
one never changing makeup packet it

643
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:51,720
gives me the idea that there is no

644
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,179
password some somewhere

645
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:56,640
um the second one again query the

646
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,760
username model and you know the type the

647
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,640
version and then the third packet I

648
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,220
noticed that there was the 66 I inserted

649
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,600
from the software point of view so I

650
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,520
thought okay maybe that's the pack I've

651
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,760
create new user ID and then this one

652
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,740
again into your text but this time was

653
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,640
from the PC to the hand punch was

654
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,260
containing exactly the the string I

655
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,179
inserted from the software content so I

656
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:22,500
thought okay it's definitely plain Tech

657
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,179
it doesn't look like there is any

658
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:27,059
session handling uh part in the protocol

659
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:30,120
most likely I see many times ffs at the

660
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,700
ends looks like padding if you she

661
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,500
played with I don't know GSM mobile

662
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,900
networks the 2D padding is always there

663
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,820
so I thought that something like that

664
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,380
probably somewhere at the end there must

665
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,419
be a CRC for sure or some Integrity

666
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:44,760
check and then later on was confirmed

667
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,900
because by playing with the latest uh

668
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:51,900
couples of digits uh bites uh I was able

669
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,440
to figure out that was a CRC 16x modem

670
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,740
version of CRC and then eventually I

671
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,860
continue doing this kind of tests until

672
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:04,260
I started enrolling a new hand so the

673
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,120
idea is that what happens you create a

674
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,179
new user you name it with the string

675
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:11,820
the username you want you associate that

676
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,039
username with an ID which is your also

677
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:16,100
your input which you need to insert the

678
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:19,080
login after before your hand you before

679
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,240
placing your hand and then you start the

680
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,919
enrolling process the enrolling process

681
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:25,320
for activity is like you place your hand

682
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,320
three times back and forth inside the

683
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,419
device and with scan three times then

684
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:33,000
make uh you know medium value and then

685
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,740
create the template your hand template

686
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,240
here

687
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,360
the interesting part is that okay this

688
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,580
part of the conversation I was enabled

689
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,980
still now is kind of obscure because

690
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,740
sometimes they are just the same

691
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,980
requests going forward back and and

692
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,380
getting different replies but it was

693
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,880
irrelevant because I thought it was

694
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,580
something like practically in this in

695
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,640
this period of time I was literally

696
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,740
inserting and removing my hand so it's

697
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,220
something like you know on hold the

698
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:08,100
communication or heartbeat packets and

699
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,340
the point is here once I finish the the

700
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,080
acquisition of the three times of my

701
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,140
hand I got back this packet and this

702
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,140
packet then was sent so here is the fun

703
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,440
part so the the software the PC software

704
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,200
sent this acted and the hand punch after

705
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,000
finishing the position and created a

706
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,539
template sends back this data and until

707
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:33,299
here I was not sure what it was but then

708
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:35,279
I see immediately after you see another

709
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,580
request made by the software with the ID

710
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:43,260
of my user and the same data 64 70 33

711
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,240
years on support so and then if you

712
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,039
count all of them is one two three four

713
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,679
five nine which is exactly the nine

714
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,460
bytes uh mentioned at the beginning uh

715
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,620
of the hand templates that's how they

716
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,440
they they are describing the the

717
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,299
definition of this kind of

718
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:03,840
uh hand uh hand geometry recognition

719
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,140
based system so there is a nine byte

720
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,059
data for hand number so I connected dots

721
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:11,340
and eventually figured out that this was

722
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,679
the hand then and then I thought usually

723
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,779
in a physical access control system with

724
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:19,140
a ref ID based most of the time once the

725
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,580
fingerprint is acquired the first time

726
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,700
is not sent back they come up to the to

727
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,620
the server or the C of the sphere garage

728
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,080
usually stored in a secret part of the

729
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,539
of the reader itself because you know

730
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:33,240
because of security reasons in this case

731
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,820
this device is sending back the template

732
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,860
and that's very useful with instead of

733
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,140
trying to extract it directly in the

734
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,020
memory of this device I was able to just

735
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,600
extract my hand template and keep it and

736
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,760
then eventually uh due to different

737
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,220
facts like you know the lack of

738
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,919
authentication lack of session only weak

739
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:54,659
Integrity routine for you know the

740
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:57,179
Integrity of the packets total absence

741
00:29:57,179 --> 00:29:59,460
of you know any security feature out

742
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,640
there with that template in my my hands

743
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,159
so to speak I will I'm able now to push

744
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:06,380
remotely

745
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:09,960
uh my template so I can enroll remotely

746
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,140
without any any security feature

747
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,659
blocking me a new hand of any device I

748
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:18,480
want as soon as I know their IP and the

749
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,760
TCP Port if it's not the default one I

750
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,620
can create a new user remotely with my

751
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,899
hand so the idea is that at the end you

752
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:27,419
end up like literally as soon as you

753
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:29,700
identify one of these devices and you

754
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,799
know the AP you can just move by the

755
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:34,320
entrance of the vertical there is this

756
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,500
device used in the nearby the door

757
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,779
connect to the through the you know land

758
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:42,000
eventually or we see later even through

759
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,240
internet suddenly and just push your you

760
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,460
know your enroll your you as a new super

761
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,520
admin with your known template and then

762
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,820
you can just log in and that's it so in

763
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,399
order to achieve all of this I created a

764
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,820
simple tool that everybody is after the

765
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:01,860
GitHub which I call the hand owner tool

766
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,860
Suite this documents about my developing

767
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,360
capabilities I

768
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,179
I am but you know I'm not the best

769
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:11,880
developer that is like I usually

770
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,539
call myself

771
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,620
part-time

772
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,419
so in this case you could what you can

773
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:20,640
do like created a scanner which scans

774
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,320
practically you need to send some

775
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,419
specific packets like the wake up packet

776
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:26,820
so the idea is that with this we have

777
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,039
sort of end map plugin actually I was

778
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,159
planning to push make a pull request for

779
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,299
um

780
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:36,059
needs requests for uh adding this again

781
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:38,760
on the end map and the idea is you can

782
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,100
scan the network actually this is a lamp

783
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,279
this later you can also with the

784
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:46,799
internet Level side and the idea is that

785
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,020
it sends you back all the information of

786
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,940
possible vulnerable devices in the

787
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:54,419
internet and actually you can even get a

788
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:57,240
is root forcing the device servers

789
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,860
because probably at the very beginning

790
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,260
was when this device was created was

791
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,679
connected over you know not the CV so

792
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,860
rs485 for example so each device had its

793
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,200
own uh device address

794
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,299
actually by by default all device

795
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:15,120
addresses all these devices nowadays

796
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,299
have zero zero value as default device

797
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:21,659
adders but you know I I made a I made a

798
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:24,059
loop that eventually scans also for

799
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:27,840
other device addresses in case is not uh

800
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,419
it is not found the the phone so in this

801
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:34,260
case uh with the with the tool we can

802
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:37,740
um the easiest way to enroll a super

803
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,140
admin a malicious super admin is to

804
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:43,520
enroll just do as is supposed to do

805
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,760
usually uh the device so you go nearby

806
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,520
as soon as you have the AP you send this

807
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,940
command

808
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,559
and it will

809
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:58,919
start enrolling a new user 666 which

810
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:00,480
didn't exist at the beginning of this

811
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,380
video

812
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,480
and then you just need to enroll three

813
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,240
times so to scan free time your hand in

814
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,039
a way that the device itself will create

815
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:09,960
a new template

816
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:15,260
and then once the new user is enrolled

817
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,840
then does the magic communicates back

818
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,820
with you know with the hand corner

819
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,899
script

820
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:25,200
and then you can just log in and

821
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,500
and that's it you should be in okay this

822
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:32,159
way is uh it is a it is nice but is not

823
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,799
as uh as fast as uh the other one like

824
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,200
you know walk by with the phone with the

825
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,340
phone hidden ready doing the IP and uh

826
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,600
and that's why it's called known

827
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,399
template because by with these

828
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,159
weaknesses we found by analyzing the the

829
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:50,279
profitable we are able to get create our

830
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:52,799
own hand template remotely at home with

831
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,380
a similar device and an ECU is the same

832
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,360
everywhere with other devices

833
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,360
so it can be you know exported and

834
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,419
reported so to speak so in this case I

835
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:05,760
hardcoded template of my hand inside the

836
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,679
screen but eventually you can use the

837
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:08,760
minus t

838
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,699
to you know your own hand of course the

839
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,739
the prerequisite is that you need at

840
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:15,540
least one time access to one of these

841
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,000
devices to create your own handphone or

842
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,099
you can use my hand template and call me

843
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,940
in and I will open the door for you

844
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:25,800
so the idea here is just you know just

845
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,780
you just need the AP because the default

846
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,300
Port was 301 and what it does is just

847
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,460
push everything there

848
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,679
and you are it and that's it so at the

849
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,780
beginning of the video I was unable to

850
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:40,859
login as 666. but now 666 user exists

851
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:43,020
and voila so this is the fastest way so

852
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,239
in a few seconds as soon as you know the

853
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:48,839
IP of this device you're in

854
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:50,879
um

855
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,719
so other features that I wanted to is uh

856
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,940
dumping the user IDs because user IDs

857
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,740
are also PIN codes so sometimes may

858
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,780
leave some good information and that PIN

859
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,180
code may be you know reused somewhere

860
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,460
else so good to know and we can down

861
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,099
without you know without any any other

862
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:09,780
trigger because it's just you know over

863
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,220
the language you know the the only

864
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,180
product is it is you know the AP so

865
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,740
regarding this point well this is the

866
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,740
entire responsible disclosure timeline

867
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,480
um

868
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,339
after which the end of the last meeting

869
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:25,440
I had with the vendor they informed me

870
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,440
that they they set this entire product

871
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,079
line end of life around the time I

872
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:33,420
disclosed this vulnerability so it was a

873
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,220
raining plan to make it end of life they

874
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,200
just speeded up the process the thing is

875
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,060
that there will not be firmware updates

876
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,640
more public released

877
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,099
and then I was like okay that's that's

878
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:46,079
not my decision the point is that I was

879
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,420
afraid what happens if there are some of

880
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,700
them expose the line and they said who

881
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,500
does expose them online

882
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,260
and well then eventually I ended up

883
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,920
asking John from uh from shodon if we'd

884
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,380
Implement part of the of the network

885
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,839
particle I reverse the engineer in a way

886
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,880
that you know we can check online with

887
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,740
these probes on the network the internet

888
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,260
if there are and actually there are

889
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,820
something like that they are checked in

890
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,339
the morning there's this

891
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:16,140
1752 because since they set end of life

892
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,180
more and more customers they are

893
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,760
replacing them but not as fast as uh you

894
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,740
know you can imagine so the idea is that

895
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,800
if right now actually it's already

896
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,960
six seven months that there is this

897
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,880
feature hidden in show them available to

898
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,940
everyone but uh you know I never made it

899
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,640
public so if you go now on a showdown a

900
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,920
right hand punch you can see these

901
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,960
devices you can even see we managed to

902
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,420
get out also not just the fact that the

903
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,579
version or the model but also how many

904
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:46,619
users are enrolled and eventually even

905
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:49,140
the logs because some devices may not

906
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,540
are may not be always connected to a

907
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,220
software like the one I showed you

908
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,140
before the stop app so you can even see

909
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,300
the logs out there so you can even see

910
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,640
who exited and enter the device and of

911
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,060
course potentially you could push the

912
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:05,220
your hand template as as I showed in the

913
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:09,660
project so yeah the situation is is a

914
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,760
smaller that's

915
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,320
I cannot connect

916
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,420
so just to give you some ideas like I I

917
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,820
took one random IP out there found on

918
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,619
show them and they found something like

919
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:22,500
10 000 users enrolled and they were like

920
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:26,880
the username you you name and surname so

921
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,220
then I tried to con do some scene

922
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,720
because you can see the AP so you can

923
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,220
see the region you can see that actually

924
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,320
the company to which these static IP is

925
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,060
allocated I try to do some responsible

926
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,220
thinking contacting some of them but

927
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,800
they got scared and they didn't reply so

928
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,599
well but

929
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:46,680
I I try to be as more polite as possible

930
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,540
to explain the situation but they were

931
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:51,660
not not even I.T people so they got yes

932
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,839
what so just just in case just if you

933
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:56,579
ever seen someone around with this kind

934
00:37:56,579 --> 00:37:58,740
of devices I strongly recommend to

935
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,900
inform them that the potential you know

936
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,500
threats incoming if they're exposed

937
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,200
pretty much it from my side Pro tip

938
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,540
while I was writing the white paper uh

939
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,160
that you know will be published with the

940
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,619
slides as well I realized that there is

941
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:16,800
this handpunch.com uh what was I will

942
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,300
notify the vendor as well about this

943
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,940
they leaked all the manuals included a

944
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,720
sort of SDK about the the protocol so

945
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,640
later on I was able to confirm that the

946
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,619
wake up was really sort of wake up was

947
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:31,140
it it's all different so just you know

948
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,180
Pro tip when you start the research you

949
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,760
also check like you know web Bank Hunter

950
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,280
to usually just check things just move

951
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,640
your uh your life in researching things

952
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,339
and the unchangeable password well this

953
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:46,140
is funny so this is the manual that they

954
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,119
found you know right in the paper and

955
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:49,020
actually

956
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,960
to set up things there is no that there

957
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,359
is a password which is in the menu and

958
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:55,920
this is hardcoded and they are

959
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,900
mentioning that you can change it but

960
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,520
you cannot so it's always the same

961
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,420
password so even if you if even if you

962
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,160
don't have the lock to open the device

963
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,180
you can always access uh the the

964
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,579
supervisor mode with the with the always

965
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:13,500
the same password so it's something like

966
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,700
uh

967
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,700
it was funny I decided to live as a as a

968
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,460
reminder that you know always be

969
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,460
cautious on on when you review your

970
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,440
manual or no

971
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,380
that's pretty much it uh thank you any

972
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,800
questions

973
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:33,740
all right

974
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:38,400
thanks Luca uh do we have questions from

975
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,480
the audience yes we do

976
00:39:47,339 --> 00:39:49,800
did you did you ever try to like learn

977
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,599
the Silicon hand

978
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,240
as like a standard template

979
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,579
well that's a good question no no okay I

980
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:58,560
I didn't understand but I will when I

981
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,180
already print our own silicon templates

982
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,700
and no actually yeah actually that's a

983
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,099
good point the 3D printed version of the

984
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:07,140
Silicon hand I didn't try then we could

985
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,760
just put it on everyone and then walk up

986
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,060
to everyone

987
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:16,740
yeah actually yeah you know I was giving

988
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,180
for granted as someone I want to

989
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,520
replicate this attack has to enroll his

990
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,079
own hand but actually at this point it

991
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,760
makes perfectly sense because then I

992
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,640
just share the STL file of you're a

993
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:31,040
genius man I cannot see you well huh

994

scan of the interesting to me that's the

1000
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,540
camera in ATMs

1001
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,940

1002
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,619
some guys here that may play with

1003
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:10,020
photography about their position I mean

1004
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,000
how detailed would be but the idea makes

1005
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,280
sense so probably with a very with a

1006
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,500
good quality

1007
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,900
um sensor for you know the graphic

1008
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,160
sensor which is what you do when you

1009
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,020
absolutely yeah because the idea is the

1010
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:25,200
same so yeah okay it may work thank you

1011
