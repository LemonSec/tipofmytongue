1
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:08,180
so sorry for the first slide

2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,160
at the magical upper I guess

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,900
so

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,480
um first one was about myself and this

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,580
talk so I'm a co-founder and security

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,279
expert at ninja lab which is a small uh

7
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,160
French uh company based in France and we

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,680
mainly do cryptology and Titan Attacks

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,679
and a bit of ir Security in general and

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,980
the roots of this talk uh it's about a

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,079
work we published last year about a side

12
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,360
Channel attack that we successfully

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,040
performed on the Google Titan security

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,300
key

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,579
and so when we succeed the the attack

16
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:49,320
the attack was targeting the Titan key

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,399
secure elements and nhp uh 17005 and so

18
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,640
we booked a lot of different other

19
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,820
rfido tokens to check if other other

20
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,620
tokens were using the same CPU element

21
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,400
and on which and how many uh products or

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,939
attack was

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,540
was it working and

24
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,540
so we had a lot of fiber tokens that we

25
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,760
didn't share what we found inside so

26
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,759
that I that was the rules of Vista and

27
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,080
it's still a work in progress because

28
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,479
you have so many fighter tokens now on

29
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,240
the market so I couldn't buy I booked

30
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,119
some new ones like this last weeks when

31
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,220
I Was preparing this talk but it's like

32
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,299
kind of something infinite so

33
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:39,360
so my agenda is following so first I

34
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,979
will talk a bit about the hydroportical

35
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:44,640
and how it the hardware tokens uh work

36
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,939
inside this protocol

37
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:48,659
uh

38
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:51,299
send some some teardowns of the

39
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:52,560
authenticators of the final

40
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,460
authenticator that we we made some other

41
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,939
interesting info about other kind of

42
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:01,200
authenticators and some conclusion at

43
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,399
the end

44
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,280
so the the fibrophotical uh historically

45
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,239
it's an open entry Association now but

46
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:10,800
historically it has been developed by

47
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,920
Google nhp and ubico and the main goal

48
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,739
is to reduce Reliance on passwords to to

49
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:18,900
watch phishing attacks so that's the the

50
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,000
main goal we have to keep that in mind

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,580
even if we are all like Hardware uh

52
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,000
enthusiasts so the historical goal is to

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,280
to fight like remote scalable remote

54
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,980
attacks and now you have the

55
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,739
phytohalliance which is this uh open in

56
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:36,780
this association with a lot of members

57
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,120
which

58
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,760
manage the the protocol standard

59
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,220
and the concept is quite kind of simple

60
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,459
it's um we the use of a second or a

61
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,800
strong authentication Factor so it could

62
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,560
be a mobile app hardware token and so on

63
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,099
and the specifications evolved over time

64
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:59,459
so first you add the u2f universal

65
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:00,780
second Factor

66
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,099
um

67
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,700
specification which has been renamed

68
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,599
ctrp1 then the uof which works with u2f

69
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,680
and later you add the 502 version with

70
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,220
502 basically is a web address which is

71
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,760
now a w3c standard and the CTP is a

72
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,500
cdlp2 protocol so when I began to dig in

73
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,319
this in these standards it was a bit uh

74
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,540
a mess in my mind so

75
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,420
if it can add some people to not to lose

76
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,400
too much time I I lost on the web to

77
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,200
understand that yeah

78
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,519
free to enjoy

79
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:41,519
so um so now I want to talk mainly to

80
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,400
the what is called Fido u2f or ctip1

81
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,220
because it's it it's the the protocol

82
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,080
which talks to the tokens to the

83
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,860
authenticators

84
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,940
the server side kind of with kind of we

85
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,879
we don't really care as a Hardware's

86
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,280
equivalent to just so

87
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,739
so here is a protocol for communication

88
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:07,560
with with any authenticator and it works

89
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,879
in two phases kind of simple

90
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,640
registration phase and an authentication

91
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,900
phase

92
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,779
so in a in a in an authenticator you um

93
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:20,459
it allows you to store two kind of of

94
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,400
cryptographic key pairs the acetation

95
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,860
keeper you have one pair authenticator

96
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,979
and the credential keeper so you have

97
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:32,699
one pair uh web service so in your

98
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:34,080
authenticator you will have one

99
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,720
application keeper which which will

100
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,520
allow to to prove that you have a

101
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,900
genuine Auto together

102
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,300
and several credential Keepers one pair

103
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,759
uh prepare website design as you can see

104
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:45,720
on the

105
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,820
on the picture

106
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,560
so how was the registration so first

107
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,220
um yeah I forgot to to precise that you

108
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,800
have three parties involved the relying

109
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,840
party which is a basically the web

110
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,240
server

111
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,620
which is kind of in the middle of the

112
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,900
for instance the web browser and your

113
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,600
authenticator which is your your

114
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,919
hardware token or your mobile

115
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:12,600
application

116
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,380
foreign

117
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,620
so during the registration phase your

118
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,500
your clients you are on a on a on a on a

119
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,419
web page so the client contacts the

120
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,460
relaying party for initiating what they

121
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,919
call the registration ceremony

122
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,900
and social wearing party sends a

123
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,340
challenge to the consecutor the

124
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,020
authenticator generates a new um

125
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,840
electrical credential keeper for this

126
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,799
new web service

127
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,400
sends back the public key

128
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,580
a candle which is like kind of an ID of

129
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,259
the of the of the of these production

130
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:52,740
credential key it can also uh contain

131
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,620
the rapid uncrypted private key and

132
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,199
attestation certificate and a signature

133
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,520
a cryptographic uh signature uh which

134
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,699
uses the attestation private key

135
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,600
so on your uh you have uh the

136
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,440
registration ceremony uh mail so on

137
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,479
every time you authenticate it works

138
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:17,280
like that the client contact the Royal

139
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,979
empathy for the the authentication

140
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:23,280
ceremony the ruling party uh sends the

141
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,960
the candle and the challenge to the

142
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,039
clients

143
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:28,500
so the the client sends to the

144
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,060
authenticator the candle and the

145
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,340
challenge it's realize that and it sends

146
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,500
the user's presence control byte

147
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,020
you will see later why I I filter that

148
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,440
and so the Antarctica sang The Challenge

149
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,419
with the credential private key which

150
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,220
has been previously created for this web

151
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,360
service

152
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,220
and the authenticator send backs the

153
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,960
cryptographic signature to the rearing

154
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,240
party which can check the validity of

155
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,639
the signature with the corresponding

156
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:56,039
pubic key that's the running party got

157
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:59,100
before doing the registration phase

158
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,740
so it's a proper uh the protocol from a

159
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,860
cryptographic perspective

160
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,979
and you have also some option kind of

161
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:10,860
optional security layers first so the

162
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,680
attestation is attestation key

163
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,480
what does it mean in each Authenticator

164
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,699
[Music]

165
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:19,139
have a

166
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,960
one attention keeper so it allows to

167
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,699
towards manage the middle attacks during

168
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,580
the restoration phase and it allows also

169
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,500
to to prove the genuineness of the

170
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,300
authenticator to The Rolling party

171
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:35,039
like bad ones kind of they use

172
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,680
self-signed attention certificates so

173
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,360
you don't have any proper public

174
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,900
infrastructure uh chain so but anyway

175
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,060
and um and there is a privacy

176
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,819
requirement the idea is to have the same

177
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:49,620
attestation key pair in several

178
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,419
authenticators of the same model of the

179
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:52,680
same ground

180
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,440
the idea is to if if they would have

181
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,680
been

182
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,520
for each sample or each device then it

183
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,120
will be a way to to trace what as a user

184
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,680
you you do and uh so for instance on the

185
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,919
ubico website explains that they they

186
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,539
for one model of ubico key a token they

187
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,599
they don't put the same attention key in

188
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,879
all the devices or the same model but on

189
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,539
some batch of like 100 100K devices have

190
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:31,080
the same uh attention key and they do

191
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,580
that for several batches

192
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,219
so

193
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:36,479
and there is another optional security

194
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,320
layer which is a kunter so it allows to

195
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,140
basically count authentications so the

196
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,060
Contour is incremented on the

197
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,459
authenticator side and on the relaying

198
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,080
party on the server side

199
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,480
so it's a way to detect automaticator

200
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,440
clones

201
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,600
so if you create a clone of your token

202
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,220
and the web service that you are using

203
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,820
is implementing the the counter measure

204
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,019
protection

205
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:07,980
so you can will work and it will be

206
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,920
detected as soon as the genuine token is

207
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,740
uh connected back after the after the

208
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,000
governor's videos

209
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,779
so it doesn't stop the the Clone attack

210
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:22,279
but it allows to detect it

211
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,220
um so then

212
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,660
as I was explaining in the in the first

213
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,339
slide there have been a kind of an

214
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:31,980
improvement of the of the filo protocol

215
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,920
the 502 version which is basically the

216
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,880
web attempt part from from the between

217
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,100
the client and the server and CTP ctlp2

218
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,040
and what is the difference uh about

219
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,279
ctrd2 with ctrp1 it allows a password

220
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,620
blade passwordless Authentication

221
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,920
because in 501 you still add to enter

222
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,839
your login your password for your Google

223
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,540
account for instance and then plugging

224
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:05,760
your your token to to get to to fi

225
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,880
protection now with 502 you can you can

226
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,959
choose

227
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:12,839
to have like just a strong one-factor

228
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:14,700
authentication with your your final

229
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,820
authenticator or you can still have your

230
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,700
two-factor authentication with your

231
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,279
authenticator user presence when you

232
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,339
press a button uh on the on the token or

233
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:27,300
you can even have like some

234
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,940
authenticators with pin or biometry and

235
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,680
so on so you can do multi-factor

236
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,620
authentication for release

237
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,600
or services that you want a really high

238
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,060
uh uh level of security

239
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,980
and of course the u2f ctrp1

240
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:47,040
specification protocol is uh compatible

241
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,700
is still in 502 so you can still in 502

242
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,620
to the old way with the login the

243
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,279
password and the and the file token

244
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:59,420
so some words about the cryptography

245
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:02,940
signature algorithms used in Fido during

246
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,980
the first version of the protocol you

247
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,060
only uh you can you could only use ecbs

248
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:14,760
signature on the list PA to 56

249
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,760
um elliptive curve and in 502 they added

250
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,240
a lot of different uh a lot of few

251
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,100
different signature algorithms

252
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,920
so you have to agree on a common uh

253
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,140
supported signature algorithm during the

254
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,019
registration phase and so you have uh

255
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:34,260
ecds on the still on the needs curve on

256
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,300
the SEC p uh so the B on the Bitcoin

257
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,959
curve so you have the eddsa from uh

258
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,420
Daniel Bernstein and tanyarang for like

259
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,440
the real Cipher pens know them I guess

260
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,820
and you have also two kind of Errors

261
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,899
signatures allowed and also sm2 so it's

262
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:54,380
the Chinese equivalent for public

263
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,140
cryptography designer tools

264
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,440
uh some was about uh what is the final

265
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,420
Hardware authenticator because an

266
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,000
authenticator in Fido can be implemented

267
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,459
in several ways it can be it can be a

268
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:11,160
web browser application kind of a web

269
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,680
browser plugin so it's like there's a

270
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,720
cheap way to do that it can be an

271
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,820
application on your mobile phone it's

272
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,920
it's a bit better we will see that later

273
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,920
or it can be a proper hardware token

274
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,000
like a new USB token or smart card

275
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,880
so basically a Fido are authenticator

276
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,399
which is kind of the most secret form of

277
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,459
a notificator and it has several

278
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:37,620
potential communication interfaces USB

279
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,980
NFC Bluetooth or contact contract or

280
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,360
contacted smartphone

281
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,779
and the minimum requirements uh you need

282
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:47,339
so you need a device with the

283
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:49,260
communication intent fast of course

284
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,660
some cryptographic capabilities for the

285
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,620
the signing stuff and some non-volatile

286
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,480
memory to store some some data

287
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,220
so somewhat about the attack surface on

288
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,500
this Fido Hardware automaticators

289
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,440
so you can imagine a relay attack if the

290
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,779
authenticator is always always connected

291
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:11,519
to the client for instance if you have a

292
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,260
USB token and you let it always

293
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,399
connected in your computer

294
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,100
um because in societal protocol it's a

295
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,700
client which which chooses the the user

296
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,820
presence control byte it means that if I

297
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,279
can as an adversary I can hack your

298
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,079
computer this computer for instance and

299
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:35,040
the USB uh Fido authenticator is always

300
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,779
plugged

301
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:39,120
if I can execute some arbitrary code on

302
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,339
the computer I can communicate with the

303
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:42,480
Authenticator

304
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,880
and as I can fake the clients I can

305
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,880
craft messages saying I don't need any

306
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,420
user user presence you can use the don't

307
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,880
enforce user presence and sign so you

308
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,000
just ask to the notificator to sign the

309
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,680
challenge and you don't need anyone to

310
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,620
push on the button so it's a target

311
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,800
targeted attack but a real Attack is

312
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,660
still possible conceptually

313
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,940
and then you have the evil made attack

314
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,820
so where the goal will be to extract the

315
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,560
credential private key of the web

316
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,600
service that you want to access and

317
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,880
basically to clone the Authenticator

318
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,959
so in this case uh you repair to have a

319
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,760
physics physical access to the to the

320
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,560
Fido Hardware authenticator to be doing

321
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,300
some time during the time to perform

322
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,440
your attack

323
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,019
so it's that's why it's a evil-made

324
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:35,880
attack scenario

325
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,100
and and so you have several attack paths

326
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,959
you can try to attack the software

327
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:42,540
interface of the of the software attack

328
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,459
the communication interface

329
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:46,980
uh you can you can do some physical

330
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,019
crypto analysis so site Channel or fault

331
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:50,880
attacks on during the cryptographic

332
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,959
signature

333
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,760
and you can also try to extract the

334
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,380
VMware with

335
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,139
any technique that you you can manage

336
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:02,220
from from software people to to to his

337
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,680
kind of attacks like uh Olivia was uh

338
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,440
showing us this morning really but in a

339
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,420
really in a really limited time frame

340
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,820
because if you still do not get out to

341
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,600
someone

342
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,540
for few holes it's kind of complicated

343
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,839
to to go to the to the invasive attacks

344
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,820
lab and to perform kind of micro probing

345
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,240
also yeah that's something which uh

346
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,519
see that's so easy that's why like a

347
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,620
kind of a basic side Channel or fault

348
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,459
attack

349
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:31,920
can be more possible so you can have

350
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,500
your your your page your site and bench

351
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,899
in your hotel room you steal the token

352
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:38,519
to to someone

353
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,320
um of the conference and

354
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,800
no and some generic remarks about the

355
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,660
attack surface and and uh and

356
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:49,019
prototyping attacks on fire tokens the

357
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:51,060
attestation and the credential Pilot

358
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,639
keys they cannot be exported it's in the

359
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,980
in the specifications you have no way to

360
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,399
export the the crypto Keys even if you

361
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:02,760
are like you just want to um

362
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,220
um legitimately duplicate your token

363
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,360
because you want to make kind of a

364
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,279
backup you have you have no way in the

365
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:11,160
specification to do that so it means

366
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,920
that all your attack that you will do it

367
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,519
will be in a in a non-key setting and

368
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,459
Teamsters telling us yesterday that it's

369
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:23,399
kind of hard uh other context when you

370
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,440
do a physical Crypt analysis

371
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,880
so and uh but another remark which helps

372
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,519
kind of occurs is like with the

373
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:35,339
passwordless physio of the of the the

374
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:37,860
new 502 version of the protocol

375
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,899
it can make the attack more effective

376
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:43,440
because in the in the 501 version you

377
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,120
add you get the login and the password

378
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,240
of the of the of the user and then to

379
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,459
for instance clone is token now you just

380
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:52,800
need to clone in password let's find a

381
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,199
two I just need to clone the token of

382
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,139
someone and then I can plug to his uh

383
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:02,720
user accounts in a passwordless way so

384
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:09,419
um now some words about uh the firo

385
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:12,559
certification uh

386
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,520
is kind of a well-structured

387
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:21,559
specification and so you have also uh

388
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,720
kind of a several way to sufficiate

389
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,819
different parts of the of the phyto

390
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,640
ecosystem especially authenticators so

391
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,080
they they have defined several

392
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,559
certification levels and uh it's also a

393
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,720
bit a mess to find you have everything

394
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,940
on their website but it's not so easy to

395
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,179
to to to get everything so the different

396
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:44,160
levels are the following ones you have

397
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,799
the functional level it just needs that

398
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,539
you you just perform some cell

399
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:50,640
validation on your on your on your

400
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,960
product and then you made some internal

401
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,700
interoperability tests so they organize

402
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,039
kind of events during the year in

403
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,440
different positions in the world and uh

404
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,179
you know places in the world and you can

405
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:06,179
go to an uh inter interoperability event

406
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:08,460
with your new products and you check

407
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,340
with other

408
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,500
people who has also a new products that

409
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,320
everything works between themselves it's

410
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,280
funny

411
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,980
so with this functional certification

412
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,280
level you you you can just put the Fido

413
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,039
Mark and logo on your on your product

414
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:28,500
then you have the level one so it works

415
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,080
for any software or Hardware device and

416
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,539
it's just a way to say okay it's it's

417
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:37,320
what it's a kind of a serious actually I

418
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,120
didn't really understood the the

419
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,799
difference between functional and level

420
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,480
one

421
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,100
and then you have the level one plus

422
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,760
it's just uh say that you you can have

423
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,280
any software or Hardware but let's say

424
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,480
any software

425
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,539
um

426
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:56,820
which uses a bit of security like white

427
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,000
box cryptography so it's you can't an

428
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,059
addressary cons just check on check the

429
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:06,179
memory and and see the the crypto key in

430
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,880
in plain text in the memory that's so

431
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,340
you absolute Evil 2 so the device must

432
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,980
support what they call AOE so kind of a

433
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,200
restricted operating environment

434
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,260
and also the device must support

435
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,520
attestation

436
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,640
proper association with no self-signing

437
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,260
association key

438
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,559
uh and for instance some examples that

439
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,080
they give is like a tee based on on some

440
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:36,900
arm or Intel or this kind of te or a

441
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,480
software implementation based on Windows

442
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,299
10 virtualization based security or the

443
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:44,640
same for AMD

444
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,700
so now we can go until level three and

445
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,820
level three uh it it takes uh into

446
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,720
account

447
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,059
um remote software attack but also local

448
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,760
hardware attacks so for instance you

449
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,320
need to your products could be for

450
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,780
instance a mobile application using a

451
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,840
global platform certified ke or it could

452
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,059
be a hardware token for instance USB

453
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:08,760
token you is a common criteria certified

454
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,539
operating system at least at the level

455
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:15,960
113 and with some temporal evidence uh

456
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,480
fips certification

457
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,600
and you have the river triplets where

458
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,740
it's the same than level 3 but uh it it

459
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,039
is it takes into account also the high

460
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,620
level local hardware attacks and it has

461
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,120
to be built on a common criteria

462
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,980
certified secure elements with other

463
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,860
than five like the I guess security

464
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,740
level in communication certification

465
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,220
and um just a few words my my feelings

466
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,520
about this phyrosification process so

467
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,799
the pro is like there is a web page with

468
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,000
a search engine which is really

469
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,220
convenient to find all the products

470
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,280
which are certified but the guns are the

471
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,080
certification process is not very well

472
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,840
defined you don't really know except

473
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,179
from these examples that I kind of

474
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:06,059
copied past from from the from the from

475
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:08,400
the website you don't have proper

476
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,860
documentation on how the certification

477
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,740
process works also from a technical

478
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,260
perspective what the what the labs which

479
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,960
are accredited what they really do

480
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,600
and uh you have no pretty no precise

481
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,460
weight without fire product that's a big

482
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,520
a big mistake for me so on the on their

483
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,320
web page with all the certified products

484
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,299
you have the commercial names

485
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:32,340
that you have some companies they have

486
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,900
like two three different products with

487
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,760
kind of the same name so you don't know

488
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,140
what when you buy something you don't

489
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,240
know it's hard to find the

490
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,220
correspondence and you have also no

491
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,500
formal certificates like kind of a

492
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,659
proper PDF where it's written this

493
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:50,039
product with this ID has been certified

494
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:52,980
to this level so I think they could

495
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,159
improve that to like to copy a bit what

496
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,120
communication usually do

497
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,500
so now some uh some partial theorem

498
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,340
about some authenticators

499
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:11,220
so first ubico ubico is a funding member

500
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,380
of the phyto alliance and their

501
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,400
historical products

502
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,780
is this one so XU which is a kind of old

503
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:24,299
old company working on on ambivality

504
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:25,500
system security

505
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,260
used to publish some some years ago with

506
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,120
vistadon

507
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,039
and so you can see that there is two

508
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:35,400
chips one chip one nxp LPC general

509
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,840
purpose microcontroller for the

510
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,980
communication USB and NFC and another

511
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:44,480
cheaper secure elements and nhpr7

512
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,039
7005

513
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:49,320
secure Elements which is actually an

514
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,200
HTTP file uh micro secure

515
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,320
microcontroller so lxpp5 it was the

516
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,980
first family of uh any explicit elements

517
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:02,340
it was also called smart mx1 now nxp

518
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,740
sells the smart 10x3 generation of

519
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:08,640
economics and this this smart Telex one

520
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,580
family of six elements was certified was

521
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,460
coming to their certified

522
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:18,299
el5 plus with other than 5 until 2015.

523
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:20,340
as now it's kind of a discontinued

524
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,880
product the the not apply no more

525
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,440
participation of this product because

526
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,620
they have new one and uh for the known

527
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,539
attacks we will see that later with gold

528
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:32,159
Titan key

529
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,940
but this product this token this UV key

530
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:39,120
nail from ubico is now a normal result

531
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,340
by ubico because they have a lot of

532
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,860
brand new products so you have the five

533
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,980
the five uh 75 family and you have

534
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,740
several cell families you have your

535
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,740
ubiki 5 Series ubikus 5 phips of course

536
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,900
they are fifth certified

537
00:23:54,900 --> 00:24:00,140
E5 cspn cspn it's a French certification

538
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:03,480
managed by the ANSI the French cyber

539
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,380
security agency and cspn means

540
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:09,059
certification of first level so

541
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:11,520
basically to have a product cspn

542
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,340
certified you have to pay a accredited

543
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:17,640
lab and the lab has something like 25

544
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,460
days of pen test

545
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,220
and uh and that's all and they can do

546
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,919
kind of what they want and so that's a

547
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,500
way to to say We There is a lab who has

548
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,320
been paid doing like a big month and uh

549
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,260
it's a way to check like the not too

550
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,659
complicated attacks on recording and you

551
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:39,780
have also a bios Theory with uh with a

552
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,960
biometric

553
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,580
sensors to add a layer of of

554
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,380
Authentication

555
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,900
so they are all based on the Infinium

556
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,740
SLE 78 secure Elements which is kind of

557
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,900
the one of the best stars of the

558
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,020
infinian uh product line

559
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,940
this microcontroller this second

560
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,860
microcontroller is is kind of well known

561
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:05,039
for uh deep area other guys or

562
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,260
especially a larger other guys because

563
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,440
this secret microcontroller has two CPUs

564
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,860
which work uh in a mirrored way and the

565
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,480
idea was like

566
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,400
um if you if you inject a laser fault

567
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,880
for instance as the code is executed on

568
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,059
on the two CPUs if we kind of if we

569
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:25,919
micro second or every 10 microseconds

570
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,299
something like that the

571
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:28,799
so to check that they are still in the

572
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,500
same state so it was a

573
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,679
an expensive way to add a big layer of

574
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:36,240
security against fault attacks in

575
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,740
general and especially against larger

576
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,000
attacks

577
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,520
so it's a really good microcontroller

578
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,080
um which also has a USB uh interface USB

579
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,080
capabilities so with only one chip you

580
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,039
have the the communication feature and

581
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,980
the security cryptographic feature and

582
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,740
this chip is certified el6 with other

583
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,140
than five at the security level so the I

584
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,360
guess security level in common criteria

585
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,480
is still

586
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,240
uh mainly used by a lot of of smart

587
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,659
advundors in in in biometric passports

588
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:14,460
in credit cards and so on and so on so

589
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,440
yeah it's a good sequel element

590
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,700
uh the project is um also your ubt5 uh

591
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,419
series they are u2f and 502 compliance

592
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:26,220
and

593
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,320
um they have the the Fido certification

594
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,500
level uh only um level one I don't know

595
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,360
I don't know why because I think they

596
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,580
could apply for the the three or the

597
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,440
triple certification level

598
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,440
that uh and the casing is really hard to

599
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,980
remove so you can see on this picture so

600
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,140
I tried to open the devices and to put

601
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,240
them back in the in the case so you can

602
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,880
have the the name of the product that is

603
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,179
what it was not so smart uh because

604
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:57,240
um there is with the light and the and

605
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,480
the transparent plastic it's so that's

606
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,140
but anyway for instance this one it's a

607
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,559
pain to to open just just to get the the

608
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,500
just to read the the package mapping

609
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,440
because it's a strong plastic so I use

610
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,200
the auto air gun with a with a scalpel

611
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,140
and you it's kind of dungeables for your

612
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,440
finger

613
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,539
so yes that's really good products and

614
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:29,220
uh

615
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,580
um for me really well secure and uh yeah

616
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,740
I have just one

617
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,559
one thing but we will talk about that at

618
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:41,159
the conclusion then the other big player

619
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,640
about a hardware Fido tokens is now is

620
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,140
Google

621
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,179
um who created the Google Titan key

622
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:50,460
which was historically only released for

623
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,960
Google employees

624
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,659
and uh and later say Google decided to

625
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:57,240
uh to sell it on their Google Store for

626
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,820
everybody they even have a program or

627
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,659
like

628
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:03,960
um people with the specific jobs like if

629
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,880
you are a human rights journalist or

630
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,179
stuff like that uh and you you you you

631
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:11,760
travel a lot and sometimes you have to

632
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,760
use computers that you you don't own

633
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,760
also going to your Google account your

634
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,760
Gmail uh for sending the next uh first

635
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,419
article uh about some sensitive subjects

636
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:26,640
with the login and a password in a

637
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,380
computer of an Hotel it's not good so it

638
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,779
was a good good way to say look buy this

639
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:31,799
product

640
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:34,200
so you have three versions uh that's

641
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,299
basically the same product but with

642
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:39,059
different communication interfaces so on

643
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:41,640
the left you have the micro USB NFC and

644
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,299
Bluetooth in the middle the USB type air

645
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:48,480
and NFC and on the right is the USB

646
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,159
type-c version

647
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,039
the the casing can be easy or hard

648
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,919
depending on the version for instance so

649
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,140
the one on the left

650
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,900
uh it's free of easy to open with the

651
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,720
scalp pen and then you can open it do

652
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,360
what you want and and uh and we close it

653
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,740
easily and it's if you if you are like a

654
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:12,960
meticulous you will nobody will will

655
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,159
notice but the the two others it's hard

656
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:20,159
it's uh you need the audit again you

657
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,799
destroy a bit okay thing so if you want

658
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,080
to perform the evil made attack then you

659
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:29,279
will have to perhaps uh 3D print a ukg

660
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,159
to to open the device to make your

661
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,460
attack and to plug back the PCB in a new

662
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,440
uh in the UK thing that you created so

663
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,740
it's kind of complicated to do

664
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,179
and

665
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:45,299
um about the turn uh the when you open

666
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:47,760
it and you you can you can see on the on

667
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,620
the PCB that it the hardware is actually

668
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,220
made by Faison which is a Chinese

669
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,380
playlist company

670
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:57,000
and also for all the versions of the

671
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,860
Titan keys that are made on uh based on

672
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,779
the same architecture the chip for

673
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:04,279
communication is a an entity LPC

674
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:06,600
microcontroller and secure element is a

675
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:11,820
nhp uh 7005 the same than in the old uh

676
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,820
ubico

677
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,899
and strangely the Titan key is only

678
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:21,179
u2f35

679
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:24,120
not 502 at least it's what is written on

680
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,360
the Fido website and they just have the

681
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,340
certification level functional

682
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,860
with once again they could apply for a

683
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,080
high gas application Level perhaps it's

684
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,720
kind of something new the different

685
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,760
certification levels in in the final

686
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,539
specifications so

687
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:43,399
and

688
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:45,779
the the known attacks you have two

689
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:47,880
attacks you Microsoft research division

690
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,539
attack in 2019 about a real Attack which

691
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:53,159
was exploiting a bad Bluetooth

692
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:55,860
configuration the concerned products

693
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,480
have been recalled and and it has been

694
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,240
patched by Google and last year we

695
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,220
published our sectional attack on the on

696
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,919
the nhp secure elements so with we chose

697
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:07,500
like your evil met attack where you need

698
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,120
like kind of an access of 10 hours of

699
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,419
the token uh you had to perform a kind

700
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:15,000
of complicated sectional attack with a

701
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,460
bit of equipment and Elvis attack has

702
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,740
not been patched by Google anal XP

703
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,840
because it's like this kind of second

704
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,600
elements you can't update the the ROM

705
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,240
and the crypto libraries in Italy so

706
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,600
yeah

707
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:35,279
security tokens for end users but also

708
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,640
in white labeling and they propose a

709
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,799
generic final security keys with

710
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,600
specific customization for hating

711
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,700
packaging related services

712
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:48,240
so locating it's like for the the Google

713
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,640
tokens it can be easy or are depending

714
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,960
on the product

715
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,360
and you you can check that this one

716
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,559
really look like to the to the Titan key

717
00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:00,720
so this one

718
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,080
and uh so it's you have a lot of height

719
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,320
and products so the one we opened you

720
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,899
have all these different projects I will

721
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:12,120
go first you have all the details but

722
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,039
um what is interesting is some of them

723
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:15,659
you have only one sheet for

724
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:17,700
communication and as a requirement which

725
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:21,120
is a nation that that 32 Hub so it's a

726
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,299
it's a Chinese ice manufacturer and they

727
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:25,559
claim to have kind of a Chinese

728
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:28,080
government with a certification that you

729
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,120
have no info about that on the web at

730
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,620
least

731
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,480
I should perhaps learn a bit of Chinese

732
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,320
but and uh it's also a lot of them are

733
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,940
also FIP certified

734
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,640
so for instance this one is a product

735
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,440
which is really similar which is kind of

736
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,919
similar to the Titan key uh this one you

737
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:49,500
have uh still only one chip for for

738
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,200
those communication and security is the

739
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,299
same than this one the nation said uh

740
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:57,620
secure microcontroller

741
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:00,419
uh this product is also really similar

742
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:02,899
to another version of the Titan key

743
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:06,419
and uh on this one they use the national

744
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:08,760
Z second element as a chief for

745
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:12,240
communication and they use the nxp uh

746
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,000
7005 are sick elements so sometimes they

747
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,659
mix they have some fun at 51 I guess

748
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:21,600
and this one is uh is a version with a

749
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,360
biometric capabilities so you have a

750
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:28,080
chip for biometry it's a zero chip which

751
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,500
is used I guess for biometric shaking

752
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,779
and you have one sheet for communication

753
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:37,620
and and security the same uh national uh

754
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:40,399
microcontroller

755
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,519
um some of the products like this one I

756
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:46,679
I we didn't find we didn't figure out

757
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:49,200
what was the chip we took it for the

758
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,240
Nordic semiconductor with this

759
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:57,960
this model but it's French and also on

760
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,299
the on the on this product web page it

761
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:01,919
is claimed that supplement is a

762
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,960
commentary L6 Plus that's the I I don't

763
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,460
know that Nordic was applying for

764
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,500
Communicator certification so

765
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,800
and uh on this one also we just found a

766
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,500
package marking in finian and MPH blah

767
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,179
blah blah and uh we couldn't find

768
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:20,040
anything on the web a link to this

769
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,619
package marking so if some experts have

770
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:25,619
some insights we

771
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:29,099
are open so we also booked some uh

772
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:31,440
products from trustkey which is a sales

773
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,960
career company seems kind of a startup

774
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,659
in security all the products are based

775
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:38,760
on the same architecture they use for

776
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,980
communication micro and new Photon

777
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,379
microcontroller as a few elements they

778
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:46,859
use they use the ewbm secure

779
00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:49,379
microcontroller which which is actually

780
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,780
a UVM is a source career fabulous

781
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,060
startup and I really don't phone any

782
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,560
certification information about the

783
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,700
second elements and so all the all the

784
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,920
key things are really open will be easy

785
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,420
to open with the scalpel so that's the

786
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,880
con so here you have the list of the

787
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,940
different devices we opened

788
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,579
nothing really crazy and also we booked

789
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,440
some network products which is a French

790
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,079
startup company and the different

791
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:20,880
products they are all based on the same

792
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,220
architecture the chip for communication

793
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,859
and secure elements is a wise key secure

794
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:28,320
microcontroller which is a common filter

795
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,700
certified against evil actually wise key

796
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,680
it's the graph some of you used to know

797
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,900
in Atman you add a smart car division

798
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,920
making the the old Hotmail secure chips

799
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,320
and this division as which has been sold

800
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,060
to inside secure which is a French

801
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,940
company but later inside secure sold

802
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,680
this division making Synchro

803
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,140
microcontrollers two ways e so basically

804
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:55,680
is secure microcontrollers correspond to

805
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,079
the to the old ultimate secret micro

806
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,339
coach products

807
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:02,520
let's it's good and the cheap uh the the

808
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,520
the the the chip is uh also on USB

809
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,740
interface and USB stack so it's cool

810
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,680
it's kind of uh like the SLE infillion

811
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,160
SLE S70 height and also the casings are

812
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,900
kind of easy to open with the scalpel

813
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,660
and without damage so

814
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:22,320
so some words on on other interesting uh

815
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,320
authenticator that I found on the web uh

816
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,020
the BSI has published a common criteria

817
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,680
protection profile about uh

818
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,700
authenticator so it's quite interesting

819
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,339
to see that now in common criteria they

820
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:37,859
also take accounts the the Fido

821
00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:40,020
authenticator as a product

822
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:45,380
and uh they also um

823
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:51,000
they published Java card applet for uh

824
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,540
for a Fido translator so you can take

825
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:58,020
any any open job account and and loads

826
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,359
with JavaScript applet and they even

827
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:03,000
made a project with gnd which is a

828
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,960
German famous Rondo

829
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:19,800
Stephen and it's also certified at the

830
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,079
Friday level 3 plus and that's the only

831
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,000
product iPhone on the Friday website

832
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,880
which is certified at the level 3 or 3

833
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,960
plus

834
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,060
and it's not actually a product it's for

835
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,920
the project but you can't buy it you you

836
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,579
could buy this uh Java card from gnd and

837
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:39,240
load by yourself the the applet but uh

838
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,280
if you if you if you tell that to to

839
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,520
your company to do that it's

840
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,140
it's strange this product is just

841
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:46,980
support

842
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,020
um like a prototype

843
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,540
I think perhaps if we contact gnd but I

844
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,720
didn't I didn't find any any

845
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,780
business web page from gnd with this

846
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:01,640
this product that they could sell

847
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:05,820
so this company is historically really

848
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,400
known as the name of jml2 but now it has

849
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,980
been booked by Tales so I will say Jamal

850
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,440
too because I'm nostalgic so

851
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,240
historically it's a French Market wonder

852
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,579
and it was the worldwide biggest Market

853
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:21,060
Wonder in the uh in the field so there

854
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,160
was a celebrity I uh really highly

855
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,359
secure products they are really famous

856
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:27,119
for that and so they have three

857
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,820
different uh Fido tokens

858
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:33,720
two of them are smart cards uh and based

859
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:38,400
on the entire SLE 78 and one is a is a

860
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,339
USB token and the package marking is

861
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:43,859
this one and uh we couldn't find any

862
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:45,900
information about this package marking

863
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,880
and there will there was no no logo of

864
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,040
any any ice manufacturer

865
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,540
and all

866
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:55,260
um at least two of them are certified

867
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:59,280
commentary certified and and one is a

868
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,099
only fifth certified

869
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:05,520
and uh this one this smart card which is

870
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,920
interesting is like the chip the Java

871
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,720
card operating system and the Java card

872
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,480
applet Are all uh common culture

873
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,520
certified so for

874
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,800
um like for companies this product is

875
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,099
really cool because it's truly certified

876
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:21,660
I guess even

877
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,060
so it's a good choice I guess for like a

878
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:27,180
governmental organizations or

879
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,560
and a few

880
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,680
of the most famous

881
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,740
Hardware cryptocurrency wallet companies

882
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:37,619
Ledger Ledger as an official Fido

883
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:40,320
application that you can load on your

884
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,900
Ledger Nanos or Ledger Analytics

885
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:46,680
so you you require your device pin to

886
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,160
register or authenticate during the the

887
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,440
final

888
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,260
file procedure you can backup your

889
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,780
fighter credentials with a beep 39

890
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:00,180
that's away in in the Bitcoin world to

891
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,700
uh to to back up your seat for all your

892
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,320
cryptocurrency icons

893
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,320
and 502 will be supported what is

894
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,420
written on their developer web page

895
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,060
and uh in in The Ledger products the

896
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,900
secure elements

897
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:18,599
St secure elements at 31 or 33

898
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:20,880
and they are both certified commented

899
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,880
against people and for Satoshi Labs

900
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,619
which is a company making the Traders

901
00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:30,180
you have also an official Fido

902
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,140
application

903
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:36,119
and uh there are already both 502

904
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:39,240
compliance and you can also use the the

905
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,280
classical way of the of the Bitcoin

906
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,619
world to back up your your seed to also

907
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:46,079
backup your five operation Shores so the

908
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,280
only

909
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,460
um con about Tracer products is that

910
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:54,000
they are based on scm32 microcontrollers

911
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,800
which are really nice microcontrollers

912
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,380
but not so secure so against Hardware

913
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,200
local attacks it's not the the best uh

914
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,579
the best product

915
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:04,920
and or some words about other big

916
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,280
players Apple now supports the uh in

917
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,920
different ways the fire protocol and now

918
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,200
you can use your iPhone or your MacBooks

919
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,160
with a face ID or touch ID as a as a

920
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,960
final authenticator it's kind of

921
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,380
convenient and uh and they they

922
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,720
um iPhones and MacBooks they use the

923
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,540
secure Enclave co-processor in the in

924
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,480
the in the device or the the M device

925
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,900
now as a single element so and secure

926
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,300
Club is known to be some a strong

927
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,660
security

928
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,140
so it's cool and with Google Now with

929
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:46,140
Android 7 and and later you can use your

930
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,780
smartphone as a 502 translator and

931
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,640
basically it uses the Android history

932
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,920
attestation and device te as a secure

933
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,940
elements and so you can uh in in both

934
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,380
the products you can use your device

935
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:02,160
biometric uh to to authenticate so it's

936
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,480
cool and convenience

937
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,520
so now the conclusion so how to choose a

938
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,099
good uh Fido Authenticator

939
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:13,140
of course the hardware one we are

940
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,460
Hardware

941
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:17,280
to choose one with the with the casing

942
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,160
are to open it's an actual place is a

943
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,200
good way to add a security layer against

944
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,020
local hardware attacks

945
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,760
um to choose one with a secure image

946
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,859
which is common culture certified at the

947
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:31,200
I guess it's also a good way to be

948
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,359
protected again against uh Hardware

949
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,800
attacks at least at some point

950
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,140
and an architecture with two chips for

951
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:43,859
me is is perhaps better because it has a

952
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:46,619
security layer against uh attacks

953
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:49,140
targeting U.S USB interface so I'm

954
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,900
totally not an expert in USB in the USB

955
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:55,020
stack but for instance the infinity SLE

956
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:58,619
78 secure microcontroller which has an

957
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:02,060
USB and telfers I wonder

958
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,440
certification process I wonder how the

959
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,220
lab

960
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,740
validated that the USB stack which can

961
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:11,220
be kind of huge that there is no no bag

962
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,680
in this in this software stack so it's a

963
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,680
good question uh how we can assess this

964
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,980
level of security about usb USB stack

965
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,700
and a products with a pin or biometry

966
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,400
adds another authentication Factor but

967
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,339
it's it's it's uh it's it's security you

968
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:32,520
you it will be less convenient to to put

969
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,319
the biometry or to tap the pin every

970
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,119
time you want to get to a website to a

971
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:38,099
website then just plug in your your

972
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:40,859
token so you have more security that is

973
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:43,380
less convenience it is it's a it depends

974
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,000
it depends on the on the on the

975
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,099
application I guess

976
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:51,000
and some words about the shooter uh it

977
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,920
would be nice to see some Fido

978
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,440
authenticators certificate uh at the I

979
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,720
guess events like the Fido level 3 level

980
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,599
3 plus I guess like the ubco products

981
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:02,640
for instance these have to be certified

982
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,859
at this uh Fido level

983
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:07,859
and also why not some uh Fido Hardware

984
00:44:07,859 --> 00:44:10,740
consecutors which could be uh command

985
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:13,319
culture certified following the BSI

986
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:15,900
protection profile so now that common

987
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:19,500
criteria as a way to to

988
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,540
to certify phyto products it would be

989
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:24,300
nice okay commentary certifications are

990
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,460
expensive but

991
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,500
they open some market for governmental

992
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,140
agencies and so on and

993
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:32,000
um

994
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,520
I'm just wondering about other potential

995
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,960
attacks uh attack pass on on Friday

996
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,780
schedules like attacking the usb-8 of us

997
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:46,680
or USB stack first single chip filo

998
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,640
tokens

999
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,020
uh

1000
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,040
um

1001
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:53,760
so as I was just saying uh USB USB

1002
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,560
Stacks you have Interruption parsing

1003
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,660
blah blah blah so it's a huge attack so

1004
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:00,180
fast so what about fuzzing or software

1005
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:03,359
combined with fault injection attacks

1006
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,980
would be nice to see people trying to do

1007
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:08,060
that and also what about full page

1008
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:10,680
full-based crypto analytics on the ecdx

1009
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,920
signature now that in 502 we have also

1010
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,660
different kind of signatures arrest and

1011
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:16,980
so on

1012
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:20,520
why not to well it'd be nice for next

1013
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,980
year to apply this kind of attacks

1014
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:25,560
and that's all for me thank you for your

1015
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,380
attention and for staying for the last

1016
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:30,740
talk
