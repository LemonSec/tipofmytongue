1
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:07,680
okay hey everyone and uh welcome to this

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,200
uh discussion on how to make background

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,599
with Hardware background is better

4
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,000
um so I can be very fast talker or

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,900
something I've been struggling with my

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,699
entire lives if I go too fast raise a

7
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:19,859
hand ask me to repeat what happens I'll

8
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:21,619
be working on it don't really get better

9
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:24,300
uh we have a small panel today it's only

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,100
two people so we'll probably try to keep

11
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,720
it a bit interactive at the end

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,000
basically try to involve the audience a

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,380
little bit ask some questions to you

14
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,960
guys uh around Hardware products

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,520
especially if you participate in them

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,520
how you can help us the people around

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,219
them I should make them better so let's

18
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,140
start with some introductions what do

19
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,579
you want to start and tell us who you

20
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:45,960
are and what you do and where you're

21
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,899
from and what do you do for Google and

22
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,300
sure hi my name is Eduardo I'm from

23
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,600
Mexico I'm based in the Civic office

24
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,059
for Google and I've been working at

25
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:00,080
Google for since 2010

26
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,250
[Music]

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,760
um I work on the security response team

28
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,560
who does like when someone reports a

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,720
vulnerability to Google we try to make

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,500
sure it's they'll do it properly and uh

31
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,659
when someone some googler finds an issue

32
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,400
in tripod companies we also help them

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,720
like

34
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,500
um

35
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,119
sell the company and then publicly

36
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,820
disclose it later and things like that

37
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,659
um one of the things that Google changed

38
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,159
in the last like I don't know five years

39
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,420
or so is that we have more Hardware

40
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,659
devices so we've been trying to do

41
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,520
things more hard worry

42
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,920
but otherwise Google most services for

43
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,659
the last 12 years or so I've been there

44
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:45,619
were more like cloudy related

45
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:48,900
uh yeah

46
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,119
Victor do you want to go ahead

47
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,259
sure so hello everybody I'm Victor VR

48
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,920
I'm CTO cyber security as parents so um

49
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,780
as you may know carrot is the first

50
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,600
European drone manufacturer and second

51
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,060
manufacturer worldwide

52
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,419
so parrot kind of invented drones for

53
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,440
the consumers today years ago and now

54
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,280
with this we designed ones for personal

55
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,300
with uh for defense and security or for

56
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,760
companies that want to do mapping or

57
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,700
inspection or whatsoever with drones

58
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,940
and as far as our Market is going to

59
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,640
more sensitive activity

60
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,500
um we just don't design toys anymore

61
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,480
it's quite important for us to have this

62
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,239
best cyber security so of course we

63
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,080
first did internal audits or it's done

64
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,720
by some parties but we found it

65
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,879
interesting to to launch background is

66
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,200
to have

67
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,500
different interviews and and ways of

68
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,920
looking for vulnerabilities into systems

69
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,739
awesome thank you so we're going to

70
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,180
start this with

71
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,620
um I work for a company investment

72
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,940
during the software background because

73
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,920
for quite a long time and funnily enough

74
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,680
we also start doing devices right so we

75
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,720
are in a kind of a nation state of doing

76
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,519
Hardware by boundaries but we are

77
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,159
struggling a little bit but it's so

78
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,920
from from your point of view what's the

79
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,300
difference between being successful

80
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,700
running a software background to be a

81
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,560
successful running a hardware bad Bounty

82
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,099
because they all find a difference

83
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:34,319
who wants to start

84
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,720
actually yes it's quite different and

85
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,080
when

86
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,060
[Music]

87
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,720
it was the embeddy device this drawings

88
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,360
have a Serial controller as well as

89
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,000
mobile app used control with all our

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,700
services that may be used to share High

91
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,420
data and such things and what I see is

92
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,019
that there's very less people looking at

93
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:05,159
the big box so it's quite easy to find

94
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,440
one another two other people looking at

95
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,780
the work services or mobile app with

96
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,319
just a few experiences I see embedded

97
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,139
device so what's quite important first

98
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,839
is to have skilled people looking at the

99
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,760
embedded device

100
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:26,580
the main difference finding people

101
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,800
so any advice of actually finding

102
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,620
skilled researchers

103
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,320
that's why we are here because when

104
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,840
security people don't come to you you

105
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,120
have to find places where those kill

106
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,120
people go and however that I always

107
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,940
seems to be like the right place so it's

108
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,280
the second time we participate with the

109
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,620
hardware hacking contests and we are

110
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,600
really pleased to see many people

111
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,680
looking at the security of our devices

112
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,740
and I think it's quite interesting to be

113
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,820
there

114
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,100
okay thank you how about you Eduardo

115
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,680
what's your your thoughts my question

116
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,220
yeah so we

117
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,860
availability of Hardware is a bit more

118
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,180
complicated

119
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,520
um you need to have the device most of

120
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,960
the time to be able to either play with

121
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,300
the with the radius or with the hardware

122
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,400
or or whatever it is that you want to do

123
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,419
with it

124
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,400
um and you might break it in the process

125
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,900
and if you break it you have to buy a

126
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,060
new one and sometimes the cardboard is

127
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,220
fairly expensive so then you have to

128
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,919
have a more money which is a lot more

129
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:36,300
complicated

130
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,699
um you you also need equipment equipment

131
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:40,979
that you are more less likely to have

132
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:42,780
like if it's software is more likely to

133
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,979
have like open source software or

134
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:46,560
something to do software hacking if

135
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,380
you're doing GDP or or jidra or whatever

136
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,080
but uh for

137
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,539
for Hardware you you need like proper

138
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:57,060
like hardware tools like real life tools

139
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,740
which have to cost money because they

140
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,160
are not like Beats uh they're atoms so

141
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,479
uh the problem we have or that we

142
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,300
need to to solve somehow is also being

143
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,240
able to provide either the devices for

144
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,720
bug Hunters to play with or a way for

145
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,400
them to acquire them and then play with

146
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,020
them offline

147
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,699
um in cases that is not possible because

148
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:22,919
of shipping because it's complicated or

149
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:25,500
or like whatever reason then you also

150
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,479
need to find ways that they can

151
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:30,600
collaborate even if it's not true

152
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,360
the hardware hacking like maybe they can

153
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,100
have uh things that they can do for

154
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,380
Hardware hacking that is online so if

155
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,720
there is some like for example and a

156
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,120
device that everyone has in the pocket

157
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,240
is a phone and uh phone is some sort of

158
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,740
hardwood hacking in some cases and you

159
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,560
might be able to hack some of the

160
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,840
device by looking at the factor that is

161
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,580
open source or that or the binary

162
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,139
releases that you have

163
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:57,479
so that there is like some compromise

164
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:00,300
that you can find in video but generally

165
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,220
it's not it's definitely not

166
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,919
um not the same it's easier to do cloud

167
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:06,900
services and so on even though you don't

168
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,340
have code or anything you at least the

169
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,319
barrier of Entry is a lot lower

170
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,580
but

171
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,560
yeah we still have to find the balance

172
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,720
it and it's taken some time but of

173
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,020
course it just requires talking to

174
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,940
people experimenting it and seeing what

175
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,039
they what they struggle with what they

176
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,819
should see that and right it's trial and

177
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:28,860
error I guess

178
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,300
completely agree that it's important

179
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,759
that these security researchers gets

180
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:35,900
access to the devices and that's why we

181
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,180
organized ourselves with the uh very

182
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,960
quantity platform in this reaction that

183
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,960
proposed a few persons who were here to

184
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,840
look at these devices then we could send

185
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,300
through this but it's also really

186
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,880
important if you want to have this

187
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,520
pregnancy before the bunch of products

188
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,259
which might be even more interesting

189
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:01,560
than after because it's always

190
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,740
preferability to find issues before

191
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,699
launch of other products so it's quite

192
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:11,039
of an issue to find the right people and

193
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,319
the people you trust so that you can

194
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:15,539
share with them a device that is not

195
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:18,440
shared on the map

196
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,520
so you both pointing out something

197
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,960
that's very interesting which is the

198
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,560
scaling issue and also the cost part of

199
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,000
Entry right to actually get into the

200
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,639
hardware testing so as I said as an

201
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,740
amazing program for us you have any

202
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,479
advice of what we can do to kind of both

203
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,580
lower the the part of M3 for people that

204
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,500
should make it more accessible and also

205
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,179
make it scale better should we look at

206
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:41,099
emulators are there other things that we

207
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:43,440
could do to make to make that happen

208
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,600
yeah completely and you mentioned that

209
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,200
emulators so what we have uh at perhaps

210
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,200
is that for our our own developers we

211
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,320
have a simulator that emulates the world

212
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,320
firmware and VMware for the simulator on

213
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,360
the computer is built almost the same

214
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,240
way as the one running on the Drone so

215
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,860
there's very little difference

216
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,320
so for a strategy researcher you can

217
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,080
access it here in H5 what's happening is

218
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,360
it wrong but having that just emulating

219
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,680
the other computer

220
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,760
tree is everything and even for those

221
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,380
people that don't have access to the

222
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,640
device itself

223
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,399
it's useful so first the third tool was

224
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:26,040
that meant for security it was meant for

225
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,019
General development as well as

226
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:31,320
developers because we offer the

227
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,959
possibility to serve party to create

228
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,360
applications that run into the room just

229
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,740
like you have a mobile app for

230
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,519
smartphone

231
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,100
but then this tool was quite useful for

232
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,700
streaming

233
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:50,519
I mean similar to what was mentioned

234
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,080
before if there is any sort of

235
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,000
information that can be shared to the

236
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,700
researchers that is useful like uh from

237
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,320
of course you cannot share everything

238
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,080
but as much as you are you can get away

239
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,660
with I think that uh that helps if you

240
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,800
have an emulator that you can share

241
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,300
that's that's also you don't have an

242
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,500
emulator

243
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,360
uh whatever it is that you might have

244
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,580
that might be able to like uh

245
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,220
if you have a setup that allows you to

246
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,019
run uh

247
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:17,700
I don't know something in qmu or

248
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,680
something like that then even like

249
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,140
providing the command line Flags or the

250
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,300
right wheel settings or whatever

251
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,620
um that might be good enough but it

252
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,200
depends on the it definitely depends on

253
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,360
this on the device that you have and

254
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,220
like it might not make sense to emulate

255
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,380
like a wristband but it might make sense

256
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,620
to emulate the parts of it or components

257
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,140
or something depending on how it's

258
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,339
healed what is purpose

259
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,600
things like that okay that makes sense

260
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,680
so I've started screening this program

261
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,120
up and I'm starting to thinking about

262
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,640
for example things like intake so

263
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,860
basically bugs coming in you need to be

264
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,899
able to Reaper them I need analysts to

265
00:10:57,899 --> 00:10:59,579
basically be able to put them to Reaper

266
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:01,740
make sure it's actual bugs so I'm just

267
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,959
about impact we have and all that so any

268
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:05,579
thoughts on that so do I need to do

269
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:06,779
something different with intake

270
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:09,360
processes Hardware bugs

271
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,800
um I probably need some kind of a lab

272
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,540
setup today because it's actually a baby

273
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,839
to Reaper of the bugs and all that data

274
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,079
too to do everything I mean analyst team

275
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,420
um to do this for me so where should I

276
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,399
start you know it's a fairly big energy

277
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,740
because where do I start what skills do

278
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,060
I prioritize

279
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,459
what equipment do I started buying is on

280
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:31,920
and so forth

281
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,200
a very big question I know

282
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,899
well actually apparent is that such a

283
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:39,240
big company not like you Google I wish

284
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,899
we were going that clever but not yet

285
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:45,180
um and the Cyber team is quite close to

286
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,300
research and developments we beat

287
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,180
Electronics or embedded software or

288
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,779
whatsoever so if someone reports a

289
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:57,300
potential issue it's quite easy to

290
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,180
prepare someone cyber with someone doing

291
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,459
the returns and

292
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:07,339
scenarios and to see what's foreign

293
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,000
so uh we also were worried about this

294
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,220
when we did it first time the devices

295
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,440
vrp now is paying a lot of money for

296
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,120
certain devices but it's been in the

297
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,339
store for a while and when we first

298
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,579
added in scope I remember we required we

299
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:26,160
asked the nest team to send us uh like

300
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,019
to all of our offices these little like

301
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:29,519
lab setups for the thermostats because

302
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,019
that's what Nest was at the time like

303
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:32,519
this little thermostat

304
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,240
and it was fun we set it up it was like

305
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,820
a lot of uh I mean it was upon building

306
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,100
exercise but we never really got bugs in

307
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,380
the thermostat so uh

308
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,019
Mario of Entry was so high that we

309
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:47,760
another time we didn't solve it that it

310
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,620
wasn't that big of a deal

311
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,420
um I think if you are likely to get a

312
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,860
lot of reports then you definitely need

313
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,760
to uh to fix all of the potential

314
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,139
problems with intake and the subject

315
00:12:58,139 --> 00:12:59,519
matter expertise because the value of

316
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,980
Entry is also higher for your internal

317
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,019
reached team but

318
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:05,760
um unless

319
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,040
you get a lot of reports

320
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,380
um this is unlikely to be a concern so I

321
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,399
guess it depends on like how many

322
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:12,600
reports you end up getting and then

323
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,639
maybe you can start with what you you

324
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,040
can prepare a little bit and then

325
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,899
if you get more than you expected then

326
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:22,320
you scale it up from there but

327
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,480
based on the unfortunately fortunately

328
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,180
unfortunately uh it hasn't done it's not

329
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,980
as big of a problem for Hardware than it

330
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,480
is for software because for software

331
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,920
there are so many people that can start

332
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,100
testing that the signal to noise ratio

333
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,079
is a lot worse than it is for Hardware

334
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:39,540
because the folks that can get half of

335
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,399
the way to Hardware are already like so

336
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,620
smaller that are significantly more

337
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,380
likely to know what they are doing so I

338
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,000
don't know it's complicated it's it's

339
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,200
not answering your question but it's

340
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,420
mostly saying that it's maybe less of a

341
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,740
problem for Hardware because it's so

342
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,019
hard it's in the name so that's actually

343
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:56,399
an interesting pointer because that

344
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,959
actually proves that the bar of entries

345
00:13:57,959 --> 00:13:59,339
actually very high the fact that you're

346
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,560
getting a low amount of bug reports

347
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,060
right so let's say that we managed to

348
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,500
lower that part of international get

349
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,060
more people to participate and actually

350
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,040
get more reports which probably means

351
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,899
the quality will go down what do you

352
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:11,820
recommend or what should I keep in mind

353
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,700
to to deal with that inflow of

354
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,560
low-called reports that hopefully

355
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,000
happens since we managed to them they

356
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,620
were Department of Entry

357
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,019
that's right let's uh make it very let's

358
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:23,339
learn about your pencil and we will find

359
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:26,160
out but no I don't think it has been it

360
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,720
has we haven't had the problem at least

361
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,839
um so the general sense so far has been

362
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:34,380
that the reports are are reproducible by

363
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,240
humans so they don't need to be very

364
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,880
technical you just uh play a little bit

365
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,440
and then you reproduce it in which case

366
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,360
that is maybe the more complicated part

367
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,660
or they are like completely uh Technical

368
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,540
and uh and complicated and then

369
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,000
yeah then the volume is very low so you

370
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,220
can manage them you can like wild glow

371
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,260
the reports or at least we've been able

372
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,180
to even though we have a lot of

373
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,760
it hasn't been as a problem

374
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,399
Peter how about you Victor working for

375
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,620
slightly smaller company than Google uh

376
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,180
what would you do if you're starting to

377
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,940
see an inside of reports which stresses

378
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,339
that is good in a way but same time it's

379
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:12,839
also hard to kind of keeper quality and

380
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:15,600
not be overwhelmed or have your honestly

381
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,880
overwhelmed actually I've seen a lot of

382
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,579
reports the accurate on a lot of Trades

383
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:22,560
business a lot of

384
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,699
visibility or

385
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,600
but that's

386
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,000
an issue of the social science

387
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,980
especially public services and things

388
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,800
that people look at this very easily and

389
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,320
it's actually which is a big

390
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,120
disappointing that

391
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,120
that was that a lot of very volunteer

392
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,820
resources just use their tools and what

393
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,040
the services and say hey my true record

394
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,779
this

395
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:53,899
system

396
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:56,940
hey I want a donkey I reward for that

397
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,440
and

398
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,839
um so because of this you guys are not

399
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:03,019
an amount of reports

400
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:06,560
the concern is the ability of her parts

401
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,820
of course we should just have to

402
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,459
understand how it works and more energy

403
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:15,260
rate I think that's thanks to that the

404
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:18,360
noise ratio is really good aware and

405
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,620
it's easier for us to give is very busy

406
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,839
that's a virtual program

407
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:26,160
okay

408
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,560
so Switching gears a little bit let's

409
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,199
talk about Bounty and Bounty amounts

410
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,180
um they've been fairly well set for for

411
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,620
the software industry for quite a while

412
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,959
do you see the the hardware balances

413
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,699
being different and again we kind of

414
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:40,019
think about that about rent right you

415
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:42,000
have to spend more money to get maybe to

416
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,980
participate in the program

417
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,420
um should Bounty amounts be the same as

418
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,680
software should it be higher should be

419
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,300
lower

420
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,519
I think exploits are more expensive than

421
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:52,019
vulnerabilities and it's harder to find

422
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:54,240
vulnerabilities in Hardware than it is

423
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,839
for software because the it's it's just

424
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,820
not as trivial to identify but if it was

425
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,019
if there was something that was very

426
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,820
easy to find as easy to find as web

427
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,339
services for example then probably you

428
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:07,619
can get away paying a lower amount but

429
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,720
if they have to do like this jailbreak

430
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,919
and then once they have the jailbreak

431
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:12,119
and they start the firmware and then

432
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,339
they do this and all of that takes like

433
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,439
months and months of work and dedication

434
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:19,799
then it's then you you then in order for

435
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:23,819
that to be like properly like rewarded

436
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:25,559
you probably not want to pay a lot more

437
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:28,620
and buy a lot more I mean like uh not

438
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,720
not four or five digits but like a

439
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,760
little bit above and and that is like a

440
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,320
lot more expensive and it also kind of

441
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,820
is because the better of Entry is higher

442
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,679
so then if we were to lower the wire of

443
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:38,940
entry and it was easier to find like

444
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,440
buffer overflows in like the firmware

445
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,600
then maybe you don't have to pay that

446
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,559
much money

447
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:45,840
um so it's it's all about like whether

448
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,360
you're paying for uh someone to identify

449
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,799
a mistake that you make or you're paying

450
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,299
for someone to conduct months and months

451
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:53,460
of research to find the mistake that you

452
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:57,660
make and that that difference is

453
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,600
mostly what drives this uh these reward

454
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,640
demands and so on because it it kind of

455
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,960
feels weird that you spend all of this

456
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,760
time and then you get like I don't know

457
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,740
a couple like you spend like half a year

458
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,360
of your life

459
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,880
um like doing all this work and then at

460
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,340
the end like you still feel good about

461
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,539
the

462
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:16,580
the

463
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,960
acknowledgments and about the success of

464
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,419
and everything but then you give a you

465
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:23,220
get a reward that you

466
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,140
feel like oh I I probably should have

467
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,940
like done something else and then I

468
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,280
should probably have I don't know I

469
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,419
don't know anything anything else and

470
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:32,220
then that would have made it like more I

471
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,380
don't know economically feasible but

472
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,120
most people do it not for the money

473
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,860
anyway so uh there is like an extra

474
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,460
incentive that like if you want to work

475
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,440
on this you can just work on it uh the

476
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,700
fact that you can just hack other things

477
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,340
and then uh break it apart and then have

478
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,780
fun with it I think that's also part of

479
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,299
incentive but it's more respectful to

480
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:54,000
match the rewards with the effort

481
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,440
involved

482
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,539
um

483
00:18:56,539 --> 00:19:00,000
so yeah I guess if we can lower the bar

484
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,340
we can get away with paying less but

485
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,539
because the batteries are high right now

486
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:05,580
we probably have to much better work

487
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,160
with the effort

488
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,780
it's all about the bar

489
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,880
okay yeah that makes sense we clearly

490
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,919
Miss alternates

491
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,260
uh there are too many thoughts as it's

492
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,679
more smaller of companies or without

493
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:21,960
proposed bounties uh at the same level

494
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,440
as a convert or Tesla or whether but we

495
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,840
try to do our best to get enough

496
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,280
incentives

497
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,400
some people videos at our products but

498
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,620
as you mentioned

499
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:36,059
most of this tricky research and

500
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:38,400
researcher are already paid

501
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,220
their own company to

502
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,559
YouTube and

503
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:48,660
recently that comes after the other uh

504
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,200
so do you see less researchers spending

505
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,600
type of work products because you are a

506
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,940
small company with less resources

507
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,320
compared to people spending for example

508
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,360
Time on Google devices

509
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,480
or when I see few companies that propose

510
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,520
to 200 000 for foreign

511
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,299
which was uh Again part of Entry because

512
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:31,919
it's an interesting point to all this

513
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,360
and the fact that we have quite a few

514
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,340
people doing software or application

515
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:39,539
based bug bomb is how can we get some of

516
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:40,919
those people that are actually good at

517
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:43,559
dealing with reverse engineering a more

518
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:45,660
application based

519
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,059
um participate the more Hardware style

520
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:50,100
background is already anything I should

521
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,500
I can do that to basically enable those

522
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,600
people to participate in more Hardware

523
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,120
Style by Bonkers for example Honda

524
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,539
firmware or anything else

525
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:04,020
I think those folks are

526
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,200
focused on on that on the part that they

527
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,340
have right now and if they want to get

528
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,900
into Hardware they have to invest a lot

529
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,440
of time and effort into it and if if

530
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,480
what they have right now is good unless

531
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,799
they are like super cruising to

532
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:17,820
something new

533
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,520
uh it might not be it might not be as

534
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,980
effective we've tried to give trainings

535
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,140
to the counters on uh on our book

536
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,940
Hunters on our normal counters on

537
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,580
Hardware hacking and things like that

538
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,400
um partial success uh I I think if we

539
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,460
wanted to be huge success we probably

540
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,020
want to find folks that are already

541
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,360
leaping to Hardware security and then or

542
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,280
at least deep into hardware and then try

543
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,320
to get them into Hardware security to

544
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,460
some degree because then they are more

545
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,840
likely to already have the tools to have

546
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,980
paid the barrier of Entry to to to have

547
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,460
done more of that work that for someone

548
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,700
that is on the other area of security to

549
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,799
enter like it's easier to enter into

550
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,500
security than to enter into hardware and

551
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,120
there's a lot more folks

552
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,280
into that are more likely to move from

553
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,440
Hardware to Hardware security and from

554
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,900
web security let's say to our Security

555
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,820
even though like it's still fun it's

556
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,440
just like it feels like such a big

557
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,640
amount of work that I will be

558
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,740
more optimistic about

559
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,900
Hardware security folks

560
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,419
um especially based on like what we

561
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:26,159
've had so far but

562
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,659
then again

563
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:29,940
maybe there's like a another way to do

564
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,500
it or another way it is a device it that

565
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,820
makes it more successful

566
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:36,000
for now we haven't found it

567
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,500
yes we said that you were training

568
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,200
researchers in in basically fighting

569
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,480
about some Hardware so can you tell me a

570
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,360
bit more about that what you did and why

571
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,220
it sounds like it partially failed white

572
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,440
failed no I mean we found lots of bugs

573
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,080
it was cool and everything uh no but uh

574
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,480
we so we invited them to our office in

575
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,720
in California uh a bunch of googlers

576
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,940
were in the training as well so it was a

577
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,679
mix between Buck hunters and googlers we

578
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,600
had external trainers and some googlers

579
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,100
training

580
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,100
um we had uh devices handed out software

581
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,799
defined radios uh we had like lots of

582
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,260
info about how certain things work for

583
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,900
the device we were targeting

584
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,419
um we we gave them a explanation about

585
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:21,179
contractors worked uh it was fun and

586
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:23,039
when then we did the on-site hacking

587
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,780
event and then we found the issues and

588
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,820
everything but

589
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,860
their book Hunters didn't continue

590
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,200
sending audio records later they just

591
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,880
continue sending the same onesies and

592
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,860
they were sending us before so it was

593
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,900
fun for like that like as a one-time

594
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,659
event but it wasn't like something that

595
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:41,460
we that really convinced them to moving

596
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,940
to that uh that field

597
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,799
going forward

598
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,600
um and we that they haven't sent us

599
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,580
anything since then but during the event

600
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,600
it was awesome

601
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,580
let's do this one it was very a lot of

602
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,320
fun so I at the very least

603
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,840
we we successfully had a lot of fun and

604
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,520
we found issues

605
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,240
um

606
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,659
but the long-term effects

607
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:05,580
okay let's also something definitely

608
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:09,080
worth trying for us because

609
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:13,260
no magic solution and we try to provide

610
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,559
as many devices as needed

611
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,260
especially take time to explain to the

612
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,200
security researchers what we did how we

613
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,960
did that and how to reach point we

614
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:32,209
[Music]

615
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,940
is to be as transparent uh

616
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,539
0 and and share everything we can and

617
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:43,080
share cameras and and much more so

618
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,360
that's the secret here is actually is

619
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,520
more efficient

620
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,240
because it's for our benefits the

621
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,380
security researcher uh

622
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,840
okay so you saw better success basically

623
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,880
but I share well not overshare by

624
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,200
sharing as much as we could okay

625
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,620
so let's say that I am up and running I

626
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,480
have my program my I'm getting bugs

627
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,799
which is awesome people actually look at

628
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,299
my stuff and

629
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:17,340
it has that part of entry and

630
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,320
one of the side effects with Hardware is

631
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,240
the fact is harder generally patched

632
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,000
software like if I'm if I'm pushing out

633
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,480
the new I mean new code to prod like

634
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,659
once a day or twice a day that makes

635
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:32,640
things very easy to patch requests with

636
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,220
a former device it can take models to

637
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,919
actually push something out to device if

638
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,779
it's mask from I might not even be able

639
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:42,059
to patch it in the field so let's say I

640
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:44,700
get a I get a report and it's going to

641
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,919
take me a long time to to patch this how

642
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:49,440
do I handle this in a good way to both

643
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,659
keep the researcher happy uh so they

644
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:54,059
don't run off and get angry because it's

645
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:55,380
taking so long but at the same time

646
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,480
actually getting me myself enough time

647
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,880
to patch it and I should roll out in a

648
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,260
sensible manner where I have enough time

649
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,539
to do QA and all that

650
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:05,640
so first you can either everyone who is

651
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,559
the relationship to researcher before

652
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:09,360
you issue a batch

653
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,539
which is a good practice

654
00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:15,299
and apparently never had to do any

655
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:17,580
registration on the editing part or

656
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,159
something that will be critical to do at

657
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,299
this point

658
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:25,799
and unfortunately we have ways to push

659
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:27,779
firmware updates

660
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:30,419
that as a user can apply on the device

661
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:33,600
thanks to the mobile app you

662
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,600
use your phone so thanks to this it was

663
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,740
quite easy to handle but once you get a

664
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,200
different which was not related to the

665
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,539
back guarantee but we had an issue with

666
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:48,659
our Central elements that are debugging

667
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:52,020
and as a matter of fact when you have

668
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,919
experiments once it's there

669
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,340
generally high streamware or you

670
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,380
personally

671
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:03,120
personalized the data pushed into the

672
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,380
secret components so unfortunately that

673
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,200
was before lunch products but for those

674
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,320
cases which we start to trash all the

675
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,320
one who you order and get a certain

676
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,659
words

677
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:22,200
okay great Eduardo thought

678
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,520
um

679
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,740
several years ago we many years ago now

680
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,380
we we sent uh eight years ago because it

681
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,299
was the first time I wasn't sure we sent

682
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:32,580
us a gift to security researchers

683
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,299
um

684
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:36,240
as a Christmas gift a little USB

685
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,340
computer device like it had a little CPU

686
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,039
and uh it was like a I don't remember

687
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,679
what it was called but yeah it well some

688
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,059
people here might actually remember when

689
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:46,380
I described the story

690
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,000
and it was supposed to have some sort of

691
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,120
secure element where you

692
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,720
loads

693
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,400
um like whatever software you want and

694
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,260
then you can lock it so that you cannot

695
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,419
extract secrets and things from it after

696
00:27:57,419 --> 00:27:59,600
the fact and and then

697
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,159
the defaults it was not a Google product

698
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,320
it was a of the short component but we

699
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,000
thought it was a cool gift we sent it to

700
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,980
everyone and then we found out or the

701
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,840
the vendor found out that there was a

702
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,260
bug on it that allowed you to uh like

703
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,120
essentially take over the device so it

704
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,580
was like like it was it didn't provide

705
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,559
the security features that it was

706
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:21,600
promising to provide anymore

707
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,940
um what this company did is it

708
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,340
documented on their websites exactly how

709
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,679
to break it it provided an exploits and

710
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:30,779
it just became like this is a device

711
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:33,900
that that we have uh like sorry about

712
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,299
that but that's such his life

713
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:39,299
um his closure doesn't have to be a bad

714
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:41,460
thing the the company the company is in

715
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,640
control of disclosure it even provides

716
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,760
the company a way like in this case to

717
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,120
present themselves as the delivery of of

718
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,279
what news provide transparency and gain

719
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,320
trust with their customers and that's

720
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,720
what is it I mean I I it will have been

721
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,279
better of course if if the bug wasn't

722
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,559
there but it does the right way to

723
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:04,200
handle it uh not try to hide it if you

724
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,600
cannot fix it then you just like tell

725
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,700
them that you cannot fix it and the

726
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,620
public probably wants to know that the

727
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,179
device that they are putting their trust

728
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:14,460
on has some issues and if you cannot fix

729
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,620
it like in the case of CPUs or things

730
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,299
like that then like it's better that

731
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:21,360
they know that their is broken so

732
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,520
yeah I guess I'm not sure if that

733
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,740
answered your question but

734
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,539
it's not the bug it's the future

735
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:30,179
it's uh it's a it's a vulnerable feature

736
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:32,360
yes

737
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,840
um so actually we had a little

738
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,399
conversation during lunch as well and I

739
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:37,020
kind of want to go into that one a

740
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,940
little bit uh because I have to do some

741
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,500
of the answers you or some of the things

742
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,120
we're talking about

743
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,799
um we were talking about

744
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:46,320
uh bug reports from

745
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,880
I get about report but it's actually

746
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,039
Four since other devices have components

747
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:50,820
from from various different

748
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,039
manufacturers and I get reports actually

749
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,919
for a one of the sub components I'm I'm

750
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:56,880
using

751
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,500
um how should I handle that like how do

752
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,779
I interact with with vendors that Supply

753
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:02,159
things to me

754
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,380
um they have low quality and that ends

755
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,940
up making my products honorable

756
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:11,340
uh well they that is that is a problem

757
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,320
that we'll have uh even even in the

758
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,640
cloud this is supply chain as well right

759
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,220
like you like so like you there is no

760
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,500
difference between hardware and software

761
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,419
in this case we all use third-party

762
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:24,360
components when you find an issue in

763
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,919
open SSL like the one that is going to

764
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,260
drop in a couple days we all are going

765
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,700
to have to probably struggle a little

766
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,140
bit to find out whether it's actually

767
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,559
remote execution or not and look for Jay

768
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:35,760
what's a good example of that as well

769
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,080
where like a bunch of people who

770
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,580
actually were like panicking and

771
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:42,539
throwing their systems over so they it's

772
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:44,700
the same this part is the same as we as

773
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,279
we as we suffer in the sense that we all

774
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,840
have vulnerable components and if they

775
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,279
are Hardware that you cannot fix then

776
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:51,960
you are doomed if they are Hardware that

777
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,820
you can fix then you try to fix it if

778
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,679
you can but we are all in an

779
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,679
interconnected world it's very rare that

780
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:00,419
unless you build everything yourself

781
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:02,399
it's very rare that you're not going to

782
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,320
have some third-party dependencies like

783
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,179
whether it is a Linux kernel or it is

784
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:09,720
the uh or underlying like uh third-party

785
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,600
Hardware or it is like your own uh the

786
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,460
cardboard that you're shipping

787
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,620
um or like in the case of like a modem

788
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,000
or whatnot

789
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,179
you you always will have to have like a

790
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,460
solution and a strategy to dealing with

791
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,600
those problems and if you don't have the

792
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,760
Strategic problems that's a problem of

793
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,980
your products not a problem of Easter

794
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,260
party components and if you are dealing

795
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,059
with open source things or if you're

796
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:35,220
dealing with partners that you have a

797
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,899
good relationship with then you can work

798
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:40,080
together to make the their devices or

799
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,419
their software or their Hardware better

800
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:44,039
um if you can't because that's the only

801
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:45,840
thing you have which happens sometimes

802
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,179
then you try to isil you can try to

803
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:50,580
isolate them so that if when they have

804
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:53,580
problems they have less of a chance of

805
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,380
affecting your products or your threat

806
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,899
model or your users at least

807
00:31:57,899 --> 00:31:59,159
um but then at the end like if you

808
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:00,480
cannot do anything then it's as if it

809
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,740
was a book with your product and you

810
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,820
just have to like

811
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,799
acknowledge that that's life and then

812
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,159
try to either

813
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,440
do something else with tell the users

814
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,299
again like if you were if it was in your

815
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:15,059
products or try to mitigate it outside

816
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:17,100
if there are some way but sometimes it's

817
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,779
very hard so it's

818
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:21,440
it's a problem

819
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,600
yeah I don't see much difference

820
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,940
um concerning dependencies between

821
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,240
software and more Hardware I'm looking

822
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,880
at how we build our own shareware we

823
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,480
depend on uh thousands of Adventures

824
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,440
importance as well as other parties and

825
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,260
we recall every CBE for a real

826
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,960
confidence

827
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,260
that you can see that before

828
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,840
it goes to each

829
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,020
and for me it's the same issue

830
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:57,480
in a Wi-Fi cheap or business or

831
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,279
whatsoever

832
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,080
okay thank you

833
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,000
so as I said we have a slightly small

834
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,380
panel today so we're going to do

835
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,940
something slightly different at this

836
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,620
moment I'm doing panels which is we're

837
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,760
actually going to invite the audio

838
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,380
questions

839
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:13,740
um so we had to very experienced people

840
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,120
there we've been running Hardware

841
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,100
background is very short for quite a

842
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,500
while so if anyone in the audience have

843
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,080
a question at this point I think we

844
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,940
would welcome that

845
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:27,080
do you have a microphone

846
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,640
thank you

847
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:35,640
[Music]

848
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,059
so apologies this does not really a

849
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:40,620
question

850
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:44,299
um but listening to YouTube because

851
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,340
got me thinking so

852
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:50,159
um as you can probably tell by my accent

853
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,740
um I've traveled quite a long way to be

854
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:57,360
here so New Zealand so I work in a uh

855
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,980
security company

856
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,360
CX

857
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,860
I probably haven't heard of it because

858
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,640
it's

859
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,799
Australia New Zealand base and it's

860
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,419
actually quite a large organization

861
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:09,119
about a thousand people and we do about

862
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,000
two pinteresters so

863
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,520
um the reason I kind of wanted to raise

864
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,659
this was my job at Cyber CX is to

865
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:22,139
oversee the hardware and better systems

866
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:24,839
iot pen testing side of the business end

867
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:28,500
one thing I'm struggling with is there's

868
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,379
a issue of business models so

869
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:33,540
um like bounties are a business model

870
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,060
which is a result or result space right

871
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,339
you know it's been less sense of time

872
00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:40,320
potentially yeah

873
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,500
yeah if you find a bug you get paid

874
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,199
the business model of cyber CX and other

875
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,839
consultancies pinteresting is a

876
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:50,699
time-based business

877
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:53,580
a customer you get engaged uh you get

878
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,460
paid fixed number of days

879
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:59,240
so that business model works fine for

880
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,160
saying web application you know you can

881
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,260
kind of relatively get a feel about how

882
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,940
long it's going to take you to review

883
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:09,359
that so Hardware is you they've kind of

884
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,000
just talked about this

885
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,619
aspects to Hardware service the entry

886
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:16,320
that you know is the tooling it's the

887
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,660
skill set is the

888
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:22,200
time is the critical one so what I'm

889
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,200
really hoping to achieve

890
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,880
um is

891
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,420
to to have the time to find the

892
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,240
vulnerabilities but have a work within a

893
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,040
business model of a

894
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,119
of a

895
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:38,400
of a functioning business

896
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,560
as opposed to you know an independent

897
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,260
researcher that verifies up your laptop

898
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:47,000
or on the weekends you know

899
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,980
apologies for that

900
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,200
um my question to you is

901
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,820
you know given some of these challenges

902
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,680
you've just mentioned about

903
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,359
um

904
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,980
entry to how long it takes to find the

905
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,260
bugs which is just finding skills people

906
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:13,260
do for you know the bug finding

907
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:16,040
do you see a middle ground

908
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,460
where uh you know companies are

909
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,859
participating in Black boundaries you

910
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:25,320
know and there's a sort of level of sort

911
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,240
of

912
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,680
invented you know in terms of you know

913
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,079
where the equipment needs to go

914
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:33,000
um you know as opposed to just hoping

915
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,460
independent researchers I know you know

916
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,560
that's still obviously really a

917
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,140
fantastic thing if it happens

918
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,520
um but

919
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,280
yeah your business people do you do you

920
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,380
think this is a model that might work

921
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,660
um you know can you see

922
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,320
um

923
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,480
uh book balance is working in the

924
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,760
College of a functioning consultant

925
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,859
business

926
00:36:55,859 --> 00:36:59,640
actually I have one example where I give

927
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,560
a group of drawers

928
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,420
to a private company

929
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:07,760
um to enable which organizat within the

930
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,460
zero daily initiative uh program or

931
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:15,119
research Division and at that time I

932
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,200
didn't have a bounty but I think that

933
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:23,040
this is found to a medium issues that

934
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,560
are important to to us and at the time

935
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,700
if I added I will just enter the issue

936
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,280
with visible participated person gets

937
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,300
everyone

938
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,180
so there might be um

939
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,520
yeah a business model as you mentioned

940
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,020
but

941
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:43,260
um I'm not sure that every good value

942
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,599
fit with his mother

943
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,180
to feel sustainable because it's such a

944
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,700
big company that can spend

945
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:54,320
uh days and days or looking for sorry

946
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,960
for the vulnerabilities in the software

947
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,599
or even the artwork happens actually

948
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:02,520
they did that at the time because they

949
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,220
wanted to show to the clients that they

950
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:09,180
need to iot sector and research so they

951
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:13,260
have to find some reason to do so

952
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:16,079
the some of our book Hunters are

953
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,119
actually companies uh so they that

954
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:20,280
actually exists it's they do it mostly

955
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,720
for the reputation more than for the

956
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,040
they want to say that they have Google

957
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,660
more than

958
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,220
um more than actually caring about the

959
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,560
money and and that actually gives them

960
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,859
value for themselves uh also like there

961
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:34,800
are some companies who especially for

962
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,540
there are some companies that are

963
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,640
full-time bug Bounty companies

964
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,099
um where the security researchers get

965
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:42,300
half of the reward on the other half

966
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,099
goes to the company but in addition they

967
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:46,500
also have salaries so you can also

968
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,020
Imagine uh that this model already

969
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:52,140
exists and it definitely is active and

970
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,760
we pay them a lot of money so it must be

971
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,820
very successful they

972
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:59,579
there's other uh situations in which we

973
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:01,500
proactively have worked with pen testing

974
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,420
companies where we give them a grant uh

975
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,339
we give them money ahead of time that

976
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:06,660
they can keep with regardless of whether

977
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,000
they find anything or not like 10 20 000

978
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,980
and then we pay them also for the

979
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,320
findings that they find so hopefully as

980
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,020
a whole it's not just worth their their

981
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,660
time but also like a little bit more

982
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:22,020
um so yeah I think the company's pen

983
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,640
testing companies are definitely in the

984
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:27,300
ecosystem they are not the biggest uh

985
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,220
players for everything but for some

986
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,140
areas at least that definitely exists

987
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,300
maybe for Hardware that is a good way

988
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,180
that this could work out but it hasn't

989
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,339
been that uh that they at least I

990
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:39,660
haven't seen as much as many from

991
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:42,599
hardware folks uh but it could work it's

992
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:44,880
not a bad idea

993
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,119
well uh I don't have a question as such

994
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,160
but I have a suggestion to most of the

995
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,320
uh

996
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,820
because we've been organizing

997
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,680
conferences and we have some feedback

998
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,380
from the community uh many times I have

999
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,060
seen that the community researchers

1000
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,920
built the relationship with the program

1001
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,560
manager that runs the RP program and

1002
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,900
whenever there's a realg happening you

1003
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,940
know the program has its genes and then

1004
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,800
when the new one comes they don't

1005
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,780
appreciate the researchers that they

1006
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,160
have worked with or you know they have

1007
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,280
done work for let's say an XYZ

1008
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,560
researcher has been doing consistently

1009
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,660
and Reporting works or finding new bars

1010
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,660
or trying to evaluate a product uh for a

1011
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,920
long period of time and then this is

1012
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,200
happening and the New York is not a

1013
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,000
issue research future because of X

1014
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,619
myself using the program instead or

1015
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:33,839
something so this is a you know kind of

1016
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,640
a bit of feedback that we get from the

1017
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,380
community that you know reops happen

1018
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,960
program managers are changed and then

1019
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,300
you know activities not a happy so do

1020
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,980
you guys think that something can be

1021
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:47,940
done if that what you see here is that

1022
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,520
human

1023
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,859
relationships is important and as well

1024
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:55,859
as in cyber security and otherwise

1025
00:40:55,859 --> 00:40:57,119
security

1026
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,000
true

1027
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,460
uh and just like you never see you have

1028
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,520
to deal with humans

1029
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,380
I would imagine it will be ideal to

1030
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:10,500
diversify so uh if there is like a

1031
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,540
single program manager that is the only

1032
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:15,240
person that counters interact with I

1033
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,500
know which company you're talking about

1034
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,440
so I I think that definitely doesn't

1035
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,720
work out well the

1036
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,420
I I think it's better when you get to

1037
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,579
see many people uh that interact with

1038
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:28,380
your box and that you get to talk to and

1039
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,780
so on so that when one of them uh has a

1040
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,420
kid and uh wants to go for another job

1041
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,520
or or whatever or wants to move

1042
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,960
countries or whatever it is the reason

1043
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,760
that they want to live

1044
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,040
um then they

1045
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,920
they don't feel that way I guess but uh

1046
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,119
I don't know we haven't had that problem

1047
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,820
so it's it's hard to know exactly what

1048
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:51,119
drives the rears but uh but yeah I like

1049
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,119
it it's definitely it definitely is uh

1050
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:57,359
is a challenge that uh your connections

1051
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,520
on the company disappear every couple

1052
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,720
years that's kind of weird

1053
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,040
look I have a question

1054
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,500
when you run Hardware government

1055
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,099
programs

1056
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:14,579
do you ask or get permission from the

1057
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:16,760
chipmunkers

1058
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:22,460
sometimes I found new experience it is

1059
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:26,339
difficult for a security researcher

1060
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:29,339
foreign

1061
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:36,359
we had an interesting case with one uh

1062
00:42:36,359 --> 00:42:39,060
oh he wants your microphone okay I was

1063
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,560
thinking like oh is he the one that saw

1064
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:46,380
you no no uh so uh the

1065
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,660
so it it's similar to the question that

1066
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,960
uh was as earlier about third-party

1067
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,520
components and dependencies and the fact

1068
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,380
that maybe Hardware manufacturers are a

1069
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,960
little bit more in like the 90s when uh

1070
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,920
these issues were security

1071
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,520
hacking was a crime or whatever

1072
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,220
um so I I can see how we've had that

1073
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,020
situation where we had like intervened

1074
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,000
or get in the middle uh and try to

1075
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,400
defend security researchers and so on I

1076
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,440
I think dealing through these companies

1077
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,119
through the folks in the middle that

1078
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:19,280
actually get it

1079
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,560
it's more like the right way to make

1080
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,420
this happen because then you are a

1081
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:27,060
little bit isolated from from the from

1082
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,700
the hit if you go directly to to the

1083
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,760
Upstream components or down yeah it's a

1084
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,560
little bit more complicated uh and it's

1085
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,480
very hard for the company to intervene

1086
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,579
in that case especially if they are new

1087
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:41,339
to this space and uh and they don't know

1088
00:43:41,339 --> 00:43:42,960
how to handle

1089
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,720
situations but yeah I it's a problem

1090
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,020
yeah

1091
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:53,099
oh I don't think so no no I I think it's

1092
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:56,700
it's uh it's our products and uh like of

1093
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,079
course there are situations in which

1094
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,000
it's actually important

1095
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
um but because like for the MCA there is

1096
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,380
like some regulations about reverse

1097
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,780
engineering Hardware that protects uh

1098
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:09,060
copyright or something like that and uh

1099
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,980
those situations are more are more

1100
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,960
critical but for

1101
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,300
the situations in which we can

1102
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,339
I don't know not have to deal with this

1103
00:44:17,339 --> 00:44:21,200
then it's a then no

1104
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,960
okay I think we're almost at time where

1105
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,420
we're at time so unless someone actually

1106
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:30,240
has some questions I think

1107
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,160
oh we have a couple more questions let's

1108
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,399
go

1109
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,339
hi thank you so much interesting

1110
00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:39,060
um

1111
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:41,400
I'm just about you have some kind of

1112
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,839
Partnerships or programs related to that

1113
00:44:44,839 --> 00:44:47,400
research centers they have equipment

1114
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,280
they have people skills that are able to

1115
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:53,940
to try to find minorities there but they

1116
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:55,560
also find you know interesting some

1117
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,560
devices but uh maybe there's some kind

1118
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,560
of programs that led them to start with

1119
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,119
the computer with the devices they will

1120
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,099
focus on that once instead of all of us

1121
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:08,400
and there are days there is uh resources

1122
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,200
there is the really interesting effect

1123
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,460
of the people

1124
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:15,359
sometimes uh able to find that companies

1125
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:18,380
to try to

1126
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:25,160
things like that see

1127
00:45:25,339 --> 00:45:28,020
the thing that comes to mind is that we

1128
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,460
were in local Berlin the other

1129
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,920
conference that he organizes

1130
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,000
um come is in March next year so uh

1131
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,440
the and there we gave a bunch of devices

1132
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,420
like a ton of devices and some of them

1133
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:40,859
were through academics precisely for

1134
00:45:40,859 --> 00:45:42,960
this reason because they they said like

1135
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,339
oh yeah if you give us some exactly what

1136
00:45:44,339 --> 00:45:45,300
you said

1137
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,460
um so I think that works

1138
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,560
um I I'm not sure there is no like

1139
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,900
formal like academic Outreach thing but

1140
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:53,520
uh we will treat them as any other

1141
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,900
security researcher and I think that's

1142
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,000
fine there's also like pen testing

1143
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,619
companies as the other question was

1144
00:45:58,619 --> 00:46:00,540
implying that might actually do the same

1145
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:02,520
as well uh like what you did with the

1146
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,700
novel and uh and there's also like skill

1147
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,440
security researchers that might actually

1148
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,960
also do it also just for fun so yeah I

1149
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:10,680
think

1150
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,420
and maybe you're right also that

1151
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:13,859
academics sometimes have a lot of time

1152
00:46:13,859 --> 00:46:15,660
and a lot of nothing to do so I think

1153
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:19,640
that's a good uh a good idea

1154
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,859
okay culturally private anyone can apply

1155
00:46:22,859 --> 00:46:25,980
it to the uh Forum so it can be an

1156
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:28,220
integer companion or the University

1157
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:32,720
Research Institute or whatsoever

1158
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:40,098
uh thanks for your talk I'm coming from

1159
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,180
from

1160
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:53,400
the actions with developers or the

1161
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,400
actors stuff like that and it's very

1162
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,579
easy for us

1163
00:46:58,579 --> 00:47:01,380
so I got a question like do you think

1164
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,839
that it will be a trend to open sounds

1165
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:06,079
to the other

1166
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:10,380
Titans and using very small other

1167
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,980
researchers

1168
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:16,260
that'll be cool

1169
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:19,200
um a trend I don't know uh

1170
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,359
I have no idea I mean it we will see in

1171
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:23,760
a couple years but that's cool yeah I I

1172
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,280
I wish a lot more things were open

1173
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,740
sources as you can say Victor you cannot

1174
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:30,359
alluded to that earlier when you talk

1175
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:32,160
about Ashley releasing firmware and

1176
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,839
trying to basically release as much as

1177
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:37,680
you can especially make research easier

1178
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,900
actually apparently you have a broad

1179
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,180
history of open sourcing a lot of

1180
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:46,800
software we do and contributing to open

1181
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,380
this uh projects

1182
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:51,420
um

1183
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:55,200
I I already shared a electronic designs

1184
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,640
and search things to to show researchers

1185
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,980
most of the time I got the good

1186
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:04,980
Department looking for ndas and many

1187
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:09,000
four bits we can maybe we could just

1188
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,619
have some forces through that but it's

1189
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:17,640
still possible but we also try to work

1190
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:21,240
with the vendors that are in the same

1191
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:24,900
mindset I mean using components that

1192
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:28,280
were evaluated and such so for example

1193
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,280
uh

1194
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,160
that doing certification and testing

1195
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,220
approved models so it really shows a

1196
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:40,520
trainer that was already

1197
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,079
transcribed and we know that it's a

1198
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:45,480
certain number of gravitation

1199
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:48,319
uh before our own

1200
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:51,000
designs of course we invite in some

1201
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,260
cases sharing more information

1202
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,619
okay do we have any more questions okay

1203
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:01,099
one more

1204
00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:04,020
yeah uh it's a question probably may

1205
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,579
have already discussed it but it's about

1206
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:07,619
scoping I mean I mean it's also in the

1207
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:08,880
software but

1208
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,000
what I have noticed when I was having

1209
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,480
school for example uh let's say I found

1210
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,160
some issue with import injection that's

1211
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,520
ideally concerned like overly specific

1212
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,560
uh but vendors agree with them they say

1213
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,060
it's like us to

1214
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,420
so still they need access to you know

1215
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:29,420
devices

1216
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:34,459
but from uh let's say a researchers

1217
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:38,819
so my experience I've seen like always

1218
00:49:38,819 --> 00:49:40,880
is a conflict between the

1219
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,160
runners and also there's just so where

1220
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,940
like okay when I say it's about

1221
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:49,140
it's a hard to attack

1222
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:54,560
right why would you address that issue

1223
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:58,079
if I mean this is also a problem for

1224
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,359
normal normal software uh it's not uh

1225
00:50:00,359 --> 00:50:02,220
it's not unique to her like sometimes

1226
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:04,800
the what is a vulnerabilities uh very

1227
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,839
philosophical question

1228
00:50:06,839 --> 00:50:08,099
um they

1229
00:50:08,099 --> 00:50:10,500
usually what matters is that there is

1230
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,800
something of value that someone can get

1231
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,680
from someone else so if with a fault

1232
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,180
injection attack there is an attack

1233
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,099
scenario that actually matters where

1234
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:22,380
this could actually put someone at risk

1235
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:26,099
or uh still or or cause damage or

1236
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:28,800
anything then I think you could consider

1237
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,140
the vulnerability if you can break your

1238
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:32,579
own device

1239
00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:34,500
or you can do something to your own

1240
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,359
device that maybe has no significant

1241
00:50:36,359 --> 00:50:38,480
security consequence that may be less so

1242
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,040
sometimes companies protect their

1243
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,380
firmware for no good reason so the fact

1244
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,780
that you can strike the firmware maybe

1245
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,640
it's not that big of a deal so I guess

1246
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,099
it will always depend uh on what it is

1247
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:52,319
the attack that you are they're trying

1248
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:53,700
to like if you're trying to jailbreak

1249
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:56,460
your uh your

1250
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,800
um like to be able to play arbitrary

1251
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,440
games like Homebrew your

1252
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,059
uh what is it called like gaming device

1253
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:05,460
so that you can like play games and so

1254
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:08,339
on like then I mean I'm not sure like I

1255
00:51:08,339 --> 00:51:09,780
guess the vendor will actually consider

1256
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:11,880
it a vulnerability if they want to

1257
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,920
protect against you playing things on

1258
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,059
your own device but they probably

1259
00:51:15,059 --> 00:51:16,920
wouldn't consider it if they don't

1260
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,540
actually see that as a treadmill in

1261
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,579
their threat model because they don't

1262
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:22,800
have like partners that do Revenue share

1263
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,660
and things like that so then I imagine

1264
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:27,240
that then those cases didn't matter a

1265
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,680
little bit less so it will always depend

1266
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,119
on what is the tax scenario what is the

1267
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:31,559
threat model that you're presenting and

1268
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:33,720
I imagine that when you are talking to

1269
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,220
the company about this you want to talk

1270
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,839
about it in those terms not about

1271
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:38,880
whether it's a vulnerability or not but

1272
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,640
about what is the attack scenario like

1273
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,099
what will the attacker gain who is the

1274
00:51:44,099 --> 00:51:46,859
victim who is the uh attacker and so on

1275
00:51:46,859 --> 00:51:48,240
and this is true not just for Hardware

1276
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,520
this is also true for all types of

1277
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:53,760
security security research which is like

1278
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,859
the fact that there is like a specific

1279
00:51:55,859 --> 00:51:58,440
vulnerability or attack class or

1280
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,700
something like that that a specific

1281
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,700
software Hardware is affected by doesn't

1282
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:05,339
always mean that the issue is has

1283
00:52:05,339 --> 00:52:07,079
security consequences

1284
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:09,180
and vice versa the fact that uh

1285
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:10,559
something that is completely working as

1286
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:12,300
intended has security consequences can

1287
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,619
be a vulnerability even though it

1288
00:52:13,619 --> 00:52:15,119
doesn't look like one

1289
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:16,859
um so it's always about attack scenario

1290
00:52:16,859 --> 00:52:18,780
and less about like the vulnerability

1291
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:21,000
class or the or the attack that is being

1292
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,880
made and uh and and if and talking about

1293
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,920
it at those higher level terms is

1294
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,720
usually what is going to be make it

1295
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,059
easier for the three edgers or for the

1296
00:52:30,059 --> 00:52:33,960
uh researcher to agree on something even

1297
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,880
if that agreement is like I consider

1298
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,640
that uh a big deal because I use my my

1299
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,920
devices way and the vendor doesn't

1300
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,900
expect you to use it that way but at

1301
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,460
least then you are in agreement that

1302
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:45,960
that is a disagreement this agreement is

1303
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,480
like you're using it in a weird way but

1304
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:52,819
uh well it's complicated

1305
00:52:53,819 --> 00:52:56,760
yeah he's quite important for the

1306
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,099
volunteer reports to be first accurate

1307
00:52:59,099 --> 00:53:02,220
and then based on the real Attack Styles

1308
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,760
and the assumptions of Rise Equity

1309
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,740
growth problems

1310
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:10,079
um so just like when you are dentists

1311
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:12,960
you want them to find real original DTS

1312
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,940
exploit them and at the point it was

1313
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:18,420
exploits it's she was going to just go

1314
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:21,359
further so for for pregnancy it's the

1315
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:23,339
same you're looking for real problems

1316
00:53:23,339 --> 00:53:25,619
and as far as you find a real problems

1317
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:29,400
and you know how to do reproduce this

1318
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,160
problem it's quite easy I find to

1319
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,500
explain to this return so just okay

1320
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:38,339
either your problem and and see impact

1321
00:53:38,339 --> 00:53:41,400
on this program is that I

1322
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,980
um when it saturates most of the time

1323
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:46,940
just resume

1324
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:49,740
okay and with that we're out of time so

1325
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,900
