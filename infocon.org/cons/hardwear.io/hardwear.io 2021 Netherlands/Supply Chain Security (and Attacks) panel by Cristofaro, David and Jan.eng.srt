1
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,839
well thank you good morning and i hope

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,320
you had a great time until now and uh we

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,000
hope to continue

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,840
and starting from today

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,200
um

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,360
let me introduce our partners here we

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,199
have david caligaris

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,880
basically is leading an international

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,039
team of wannabe research for huawei

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,320
technologies

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,039
and they also started a private back

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,800
bounty for mobile phones i think they

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,920
are among the

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,599
first manufacturers actually that do

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:30,480
that

16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,439
and

17
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,079
involve the community for doing that

18
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,480
they trade vulnerabilities and perform

19
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,399
variant analysis and communicate with

20
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,320
bounty hunters and product lines to fix

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,920
vulnerabilities

22
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,600
they also like to implement

23
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,680
state-of-the-art fuzzers basically and

24
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,280
the user space and kernel space so if

25
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,920
you have questions on how they do that

26
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,280
please refer to david and he previously

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,559
was a

28
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,160
cto at e-maids while still doing

29
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,879
getting his own hands dirty you know in

30
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,000
things

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,159
and then we have santos santos marino

32
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,280
del pozo

33
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,520
he's a principal cryptographer at a

34
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,880
cryptography research center at cii

35
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,040
which is a cutting edge uae based

36
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,439
scientific research center

37
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,280
so he has the hardware engineering and

38
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,759
the adversary research team

39
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,560
and he has been research assistant at

40
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,720
university catholic de lumong

41
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,439
and is also his maintenance interests

42
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,280
are in cryptography such analysis and

43
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,759
fault injection which actually completes

44
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,759
a few talks that we have seen uh we have

45
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,520
been seeing yesterday

46
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,439
and uh he's been an author on multiple

47
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,920
research paper on topics while still

48
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,000
also offering three different patterns

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,880
for

50
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,720
protocols and internal things

51
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,320
and then we have jan

52
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,360
jan hirsma i said he's a director iot

53
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,240
and cloud for corporate and productivity

54
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,000
at signify

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,040
some the dash persons who are here

56
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,520
may know very well phillips and signify

57
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,479
as well

58
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,200
and that's why basically this involves

59
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,920
working with him for consumer iot like

60
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,199
phillips hue lighting and other products

61
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,639
from signified

62
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,040
and this is working for ericsson as a

63
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,160
security responsible for iot accelerator

64
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,040
and large mobile network for devices

65
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,120
okay so he likes to work with standard

66
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,040
people in technology to reach a good

67
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,959
security level and

68
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,720
yeah that's basically the introduction

69
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,840
for

70
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,760
our panelists today

71
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,519
the topics of today

72
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,120
i propose the parent topics

73
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,800
i'm really happy to

74
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,680
to see that we are going um

75
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,800
in a direction on an ecosystem where

76
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,879
uh we are seeing more and more supply

77
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,239
chain attacks

78
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,879
but we also been discussing more about

79
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,519
supply and chain attacks and so on

80
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,000
what i think is important is that

81
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,519
realizing that there are actually at

82
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,080
least two different supply chains one is

83
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,800
for hardware analysis for software

84
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,040
basically and they actually interact

85
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,959
together in order to

86
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,120
build a product in the end we have to

87
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,000
see a product like an ecosystem effort a

88
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,440
device

89
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,200
to give you an idea

90
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,959
iphone x

91
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,360
from a few years ago

92
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,519
if we think it's an apple product

93
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,840
actually we have

94
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,959
data that says there are more than 200

95
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,280
different vendors in providing

96
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,680
components software and hardware so

97
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,400
whatever we think that product is that

98
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,760
from that vendor or that product is mine

99
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,680
they are just perception

100
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,599
that products probably nobody really

101
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,280
owns their product

102
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,480
so that's why we think that the

103
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,239
contribution from 200 different

104
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,720
companies into a single product

105
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,440
may lead to system platform and supply

106
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,239
chain vulnerabilities and attack

107
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,680
so that's the reason for having this

108
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,920
panel in this discussion and i would

109
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,879
like to ask already my panelists what do

110
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,239
you think is the relevance of supply

111
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,159
chain attacks today and do you think

112
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,959
they are overestimated or underestimated

113
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,959
to give you some background a few years

114
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,159
ago there's been let's say a telltale

115
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,200
of a super micro motherboard which has

116
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,238
been injected with uh let's say

117
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,320
another component not larger than a

118
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,639
grain of rice this is what you actually

119
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,720
have we have been reading is this true

120
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,880
is this false we don't know but still do

121
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,199
you think it's relevant or uh what's

122
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,680
your view on that

123
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,320
david please

124
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,680
good morning everybody first of all

125
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,800
um

126
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,000
first of all one of the things that

127
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,199
it's important do we have ways to

128
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,120
understand

129
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,479
how large is the phenomena this is for

130
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,240
me one of the first things that we

131
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,040
understand so we have cases where

132
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,440
companies like fireeye

133
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,520
a supply chain attack

134
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,320
but ferrari is one of the best companies

135
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,600
with this type of skills for spontaneous

136
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,840
type of attacks

137
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,720
how many of these attacks are

138
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,400
alive now and we are not able to

139
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,240
understand them

140
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,639
that they are happening

141
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,520
and

142
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,759
we live in a society based on science

143
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,639
and technology and our

144
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,440
opinions and our

145
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,360
ways to move must be based on data

146
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,960
do we have

147
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,600
ways to understand how large is the

148
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,600
phenomena i think from 2020

149
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,199
we have

150
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,000
21 supply chain attacks

151
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,120
but

152
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,680
how many we didn't that attacked

153
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,320
this is first of all do we have the

154
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,400
technologies people that is able to

155
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,639
understand

156
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,840
this is one of my thoughts

157
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,520
yeah so basically you are saying are we

158
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,280
even able to count

159
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,120
the suppression attacks do we even are

160
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,120
able to get numbers and dates on that

161
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,800
how many months

162
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,919
fire i discovered this attack on solar

163
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,960
winds i think the attack was going for

164
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,360
several months and then they spotted so

165
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,000
how many are in dormian state at the

166
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,600
moment yeah basically so you say that um

167
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,000
we're not may not even be able to detect

168
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,600
and if you're not able to get we cannot

169
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,199
count if we cannot count and we don't

170
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,039
have information on that yeah i think

171
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,220
that's very fair point santos hey

172
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,080
[Music]

173
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,000
yeah um

174
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,199
well first to answer your question uh

175
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,199
yeah i don't really think they are

176
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,120
overestimated

177
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,560
um

178
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,800
as both of you mentioned i think that if

179
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,560
you just check

180
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,520
uh the numbers uh

181
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,000
last year's we have seen that maybe

182
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,520
together with uh ransomware attacks

183
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,160
uh this uh there is a growing trend

184
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,160
and as i said maybe we just uh are aware

185
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,240
of a few of them

186
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,520
but uh

187
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,199
yeah i think that is something to be

188
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,720
worried about

189
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,720
uh from my point of view i think these

190
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,960
are particularly scary

191
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,919
because um i think they are especially

192
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,080
difficult to deal with

193
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,120
and

194
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,000
as you said in the end

195
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,039
this make very clear that you are

196
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,039
working on ecosystem

197
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,039
it's not only the vendors you are

198
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,240
talking with

199
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,440
it's also the vendors of these vendors

200
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,280
and the vendors on the of the other

201
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,840
vendors and so

202
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,639
on and

203
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,479
and in the end i think this kind of

204
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,080
attacks uh are rising kind of paranoia

205
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,800
question and like thinking

206
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
can i really trust

207
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,919
the hardware and software that i'm

208
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,879
buying the the software i'm using every

209
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,319
day

210
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,160
so yeah i think it's something to be

211
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,080
worried about

212
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,360
so would you include

213
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,280
ransomware attacks into supply chain

214
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,759
attacks in your opinion

215
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,479
do they qualify as such

216
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,800
um

217
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,639
i think they are a

218
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,639
different kind of attack but maybe

219
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,960
somehow uh

220
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,000
related in some cases but uh i wouldn't

221
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,639
include it in the same class of attack

222
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,360
okay

223
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,680
thank you

224
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,240
yeah i am i work for a big company and

225
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,159
we are a supplier we use a lot of

226
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,360
suppliers

227
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,320
and so when we supply things it's very

228
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,040
obvious that customers ask can we trust

229
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,720
you

230
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,480
of course you can

231
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,320
but show me like the stuff that you have

232
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,680
in the kitchen how do you build your

233
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,800
software

234
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,320
what do you do

235
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,320
and the only thing i can show is like

236
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,880
certificates like others have certified

237
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,440
that we follow the standards

238
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,000
sometimes we even set the standards

239
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,839
but that doesn't mean that we don't make

240
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,720
mistakes uh accidents do happen uh

241
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,800
fuck-ups happen mismanagement happens

242
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,200
forgetfulness misunderstanding

243
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,000
of problems um so

244
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,680
i can't promise you that all of our

245
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,440
software is secure and that that would

246
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,000
be a blatant lie

247
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,600
on the other end i do trust our

248
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,680
suppliers to do their job

249
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,920
just as much as i do to keep their

250
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,080
product safe i try to understand

251
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,920
everything i try to make sure that like

252
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,440
our business units that make the

253
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,160
products that they understand what we

254
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,760
require from them

255
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,279
and yeah

256
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,760
i think that it's

257
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,440
difficult to

258
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,920
to figure out if you are under attack

259
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,640
how do you know that somebody is like

260
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,040
trying to uh inject a chip

261
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,880
or like a bit of extra coating your

262
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,959
thing you you can look for it but you

263
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,279
need to find these clues so what you

264
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,760
need is auditability but most of the

265
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,240
time you get a chip and it's all like

266
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,440
like neatly sealed in a

267
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,360
in a box you can't really see how the

268
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,480
logic looks like so there's a huge

269
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,000
amount of trust that i have in the

270
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,279
suppliers

271
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,440
and the bits that i don't trust i will

272
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,240
try to verify

273
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,399
thank you david i think you have uh some

274
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,279
opinion on how to i want to add that

275
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,760
software um first of all if you don't

276
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,000
mind i will add a different thing is why

277
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,079
we have supply chain attacks first of

278
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,239
all

279
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,839
because a long time ago if you want

280
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,320
attack organization you take some

281
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,839
servers you attack some browser and you

282
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,880
had access to the company but now the

283
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,680
defense mechanism of these corporate are

284
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,240
becoming super difficult to

285
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,279
to attack

286
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,240
and so

287
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,680
the most weak link on the chain or the

288
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,320
of this part of the attacks is attacking

289
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,760
the supplier so the definition that is

290
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,399
for example presented in a nisa

291
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,000
paper of few months ago july is that

292
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,320
taxonomy of

293
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,680
supply chain

294
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,480
and

295
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,200
they define what is a supply chain an

296
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,079
attack composed by two parts first of

297
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,399
all attacking the supplier compromising

298
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,800
the supplier and then compromise your

299
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,519
target via the injecting the injection

300
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,360
vector if we're gonna call it that is

301
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,640
the supplier

302
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,519
and then you have the advantage that by

303
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,680
attacking a supplier your attack can

304
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,240
spread multiple across organizations and

305
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,279
by a single attack so the weakest link

306
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,160
you can attack multiple organizations

307
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,880
doesn't this um increase

308
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,800
then the possibility of being detected i

309
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,959
mean because in the end

310
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,440
being targeted and just hiding an

311
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,279
organization in a way

312
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,200
yeah it may be super difficult as you

313
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,240
say but

314
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,720
i mean it's limited your noticeability

315
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,040
is actually limited to that target

316
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,360
so wouldn't having a supply chain attack

317
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,079
instead increase the chances of being

318
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,200
detected

319
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,959
in the enemy it's always a trade-off of

320
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,600
course but i think that

321
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,279
you're right you're right

322
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,320
let's looks at the solar winds attack

323
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,959
and fire eye the attack was discovered

324
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,000
that affects a lot of company but was

325
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,320
detected by fireeye

326
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,560
for example because they are incredibly

327
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,480
they have amazing skills and so there

328
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,480
was the first table to detect and then

329
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,399
at the beginnings everybody was thinking

330
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,920
oh he's an attacker just on this company

331
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,279
and they say oh no we are not the only

332
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,680
target yeah i think this and this brings

333
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,360
to us to our next question so let's

334
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,800
assume that this attack happens and then

335
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,120
we are able to detect just because

336
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,440
someone looks into that so what are the

337
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,880
practices that you have in your

338
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,399
organization that you are aware of or

339
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,680
did you would like to see your

340
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,480
organization that prevents these santos

341
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,959
if you like to start or yeah and please

342
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,240
just

343
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,360
give your contribution here

344
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,360
yeah uh well in our case uh

345
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,800
given that we are a research institute

346
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,199
um

347
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,279
in general what we try to do in this

348
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,360
regard is uh work with a limited number

349
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,399
of providers that

350
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,480
we know we can trust

351
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,680
um

352
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,600
and what in the end um

353
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,760
the way we know this is basically from

354
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,839
feedback that we got from

355
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,560
partners and also from

356
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,480
experience of our colleagues

357
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,760
and

358
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,839
yeah we also try to follow

359
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,600
uh whenever it comes to procurement and

360
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,480
processes like this like good business

361
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,839
practices

362
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,199
uh to make

363
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,880
make sure that all parties are aligned

364
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,959
and all conditions

365
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,440
are clear

366
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,279
and

367
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,839
and of course uh since uh

368
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,839
i think in this class of attacks the

369
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,199
human factors uh the human factor plays

370
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,920
a very important uh role

371
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,680
uh we always try to to limit

372
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,480
the access to sensitive data

373
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,440
uh

374
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,360
having like a

375
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,320
very strict network architecture with

376
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,480
permissions and this kind of things

377
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,639
oh yeah these are the what i can tell

378
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,760
you about the practices in the company

379
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,680
being a research center we actually

380
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,720
research techniques for

381
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,160
detecting

382
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,920
supply chain attacks in hardware because

383
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,079
for software we have we have means i

384
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,160
mean there are no new solutions that

385
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,800
allow us to certify or to service to

386
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,760
sign software and component is there any

387
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,920
research that you're aware of that

388
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,199
might apply to hardware because in

389
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,279
hardware we don't have a way of say hey

390
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,120
this is out of place you know so there

391
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,720
is an additional component so i think

392
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,639
this is a an open problem are you aware

393
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,480
of any resource in the direction not

394
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,000
only in your organization that might

395
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,279
help detecting such attacks

396
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,160
no

397
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,920
no not our yeah but maybe i

398
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,240
maybe there is but uh

399
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,040
yeah again it's not one of the areas

400
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,160
that we are looking into nowadays so i i

401
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,160
cannot really answer by the way if

402
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,600
anybody from the audience would like to

403
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,279
contribute on i know this topic just

404
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,680
please uh just raise your hand and jump

405
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,160
in no no problem anytime

406
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,399
yes

407
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,279
oh we have a prize for the best audience

408
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,480
question and i was not aware of that

409
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,399
oh it's uh well this is nice i think

410
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,160
everybody knows this from my fix it is

411
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,920
quite useful yes that's great yes and um

412
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,279
of course i mean so we need to have

413
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,360
questions there do you have any

414
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,839
yes please

415
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,720
yeah i think that's

416
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,000
okay thank you

417
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:12,639
[Music]

418
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,480
so my question is

419
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,000
there is a

420
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,240
way you can handle

421
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,320
these kind of things for example

422
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,160
by using uh assume breach mentality

423
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,480
so you're assuming

424
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,759
uh that your supplier has already

425
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,639
done something evil to your components

426
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,040
what are your thoughts about that

427
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,240
three of you pick that

428
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,279
i'm happy to answer that one it's uh i i

429
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,480
have a healthy dose of paranoia so i

430
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,240
have my sensors

431
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,440
in the field

432
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,240
uh i i do look look for things that are

433
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,800
out of the ordinary uh but the the thing

434
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,279
is that i'm quite nearsighted to these

435
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,199
things i don't necessarily see things

436
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,759
that are super super well hidden

437
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,040
i think that the

438
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,880
hardware is mainly a

439
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,199
magic show where like things happen and

440
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,640
you can't really explain why

441
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,319
it is like if you look at like just the

442
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,400
cpu and like it's complexity that's in

443
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,640
there it's like very few people fully

444
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,119
understand left and right what it does

445
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,280
we all focus on the things about the

446
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,480
functionality and not so much about uh

447
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,799
the weird things that happen well okay

448
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,880
you all are exceptions

449
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,320
but like out there there's a lot of

450
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,080
people that they just like want this

451
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,640
stuff to work so i do have my sensors

452
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,480
out there i'm trying to look for things

453
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,240
that don't feel right

454
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,240
but we have many many suppliers and we

455
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,640
use lots of libraries those libraries

456
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,360
use lots of other libraries

457
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,080
i know so many faults that we are trying

458
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,799
to

459
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,600
fix that are like a couple of steps down

460
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
there down the line

461
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,520
so i fully agree you need to have a

462
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,160
healthy sense of paranoia but it's

463
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,360
difficult

464
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,320
to to actually find all of these things

465
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,600
because i don't know what i'm looking

466
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,760
for

467
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,840
thank you jen

468
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,440
going along the this question and

469
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,600
do you have any practice in your

470
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,679
organization which are in place or could

471
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,200
be in place in order to

472
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,799
at least reduce

473
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,160
either the

474
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,799
feasibility of the pressure attack or

475
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,400
the impact or sufficiency of anything

476
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,039
you would like to share

477
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,520
so

478
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,440
there are a lot especially for open

479
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,600
source projects in my opinion there are

480
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,840
nice things that are arising

481
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,559
so for example i am a great supporter

482
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,480
and i would like to see

483
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,320
the use of is a software called the

484
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,799
scorecard so basically

485
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,640
if you develop software so i'm more on

486
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,640
the part of the software side

487
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,799
and you need to choose a library to

488
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:55,679
parse

489
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,440
i don't know a file format

490
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,120
and then you go an npm you do pipey or

491
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,960
whatever depends on the language that

492
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,880
you use and you have multiple libraries

493
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,919
to choose

494
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,919
which one you pick up

495
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:08,880
you take

496
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,720
they want to have better documentation

497
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,480
the one that you already know or

498
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,240
whatever but is from security

499
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,559
perspective is the best one

500
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,960
so there is a project that in my opinion

501
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,840
is

502
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,720
not which i think has one year old

503
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,400
that is called scorecard

504
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,640
so basically you give to the project a

505
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,679
github

506
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:28,880
url

507
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,600
and the software is giving a score to

508
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,200
the library or to the software that you

509
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,520
want to use and have some checks for

510
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,120
example

511
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,080
does the software implements

512
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,120
fuzzing via oss files or the software is

513
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,679
analyzed via codeql queries

514
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,320
or the software does implement

515
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,240
some checks on

516
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,320
github protection branch protections and

517
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,880
whatever and it's giving a

518
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,640
measure at score which one of the

519
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,240
softwares is

520
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,960
seems more secure this is something that

521
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,919
is

522
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,480
in my opinion nice because if you

523
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,240
develop software every day you say oh i

524
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,080
have this new

525
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,070
format to parse which library i use

526
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,679
[Music]

527
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,039
and then there is

528
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,840
also we speak about salsa we speak about

529
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,640
six store and so on and then to answer

530
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,679
the question of the guy over there

531
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,840
it's the question of bomb

532
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,720
so

533
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,799
if we buy a product especially if you

534
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,640
have a food i mean

535
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,600
if you have allergies allergies you take

536
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,360
the product and you start to read and

537
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,320
then you find it may contain nuts

538
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,440
all the time

539
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,000
so if you buy a software there is a lot

540
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,600
of people that thinks

541
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,480
that we should have the lists of the

542
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,480
software that are included inside this

543
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,880
software and so you have maybe

544
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,240
may contains traces of strats or another

545
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,480
library or another product so you are

546
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,640
aware of what you bring in your

547
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,880
in your organization and maybe you need

548
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,640
to add this software in a monitoring

549
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,400
list for cv zero days or whatever

550
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,919
let me challenge you on that oh no yes

551
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,760
well you know you would have i mean

552
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,640
you know my ideas on this so basically i

553
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,039
fully agree with you with that it may be

554
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,559
as a useful to a certain extent

555
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,520
so google just implemented salsa

556
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,159
for their cloud-based

557
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,960
say infrastructure and for software but

558
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,280
google is a google as the google

559
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,720
resources uh

560
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,400
you know the amount of skills and

561
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,080
capabilities that they actually have is

562
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,840
not really that common so do you think

563
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,559
that

564
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,880
that approach while valid and nice could

565
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,080
be

566
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,120
extended also to a small organization

567
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,720
and that's the one the second part is

568
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,240
that about this boom

569
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,559
yeah it's nice to see vulnerabilities

570
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,280
which are local to that library right

571
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,280
but when you put together components

572
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,919
actually we do have platform effects

573
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,480
system effects which cannot be

574
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,480
detected in my view

575
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,679
and also in arrows you that

576
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,600
by looking at just the components

577
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,840
sometimes your device your software

578
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,320
product is not just a one plus one plus

579
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,200
one

580
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,919
you will find a three or four five out

581
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,440
of three components

582
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,720
do you think that

583
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,559
all this makes sense so do we can we

584
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,039
invest so much in doing all of this

585
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,039
while there is a significant chance of

586
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,400
vulnerabilities that are still out and

587
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,600
the

588
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,000
revolution of going towards this kind of

589
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,600
system can be actually quite expensive

590
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,120
i'm agree almost all you say

591
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,799
we need to have a beer i think right

592
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,960
i think that is a start

593
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,840
okay

594
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,320
at the beginning we introduced

595
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,200
cookie canaries we introduced nx we

596
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,120
introduced something it was not enough

597
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,960
but was a step to make all the things

598
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,200
more complicated all the time absolutely

599
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,880
fair um

600
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,360
young would for example an organization

601
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,919
like yours would use such tools or that

602
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,000
do you plan to use or i mean what is

603
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,679
your your view on

604
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,919
what david just said yeah i work for

605
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,720
corporate so um i i don't work with the

606
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,799
actual products so we have on the second

607
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,520
floor we have tomatoes growing if you

608
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,679
have pigs if you have tunnels

609
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,600
any type of lighting that you you might

610
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,400
need

611
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,240
it's all connected it's all sensor top

612
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,320
and we use a lot of like small small

613
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,080
devices what was the question again

614
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,000
no the question was basically if you

615
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,840
plan or or you have an idea of if a

616
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,880
company like yours would invest for uh

617
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,919
in such

618
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,520
instances that was a great question but

619
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,640
i tried to sell the lights here so

620
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,360
the tools yes i would use anything i get

621
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,720
my hands on

622
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,200
i love the development within the linux

623
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,480
kernel we use that quite a lot for ebpf

624
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,960
so you can do tracing kernel level and

625
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,279
see what's happening where uh that there

626
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,120
should be like really great stuff from

627
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,960
from a tracing point of view coming out

628
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,880
of that

629
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,720
other things like the stack canaries and

630
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,440
the uh all the other tools you mentioned

631
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,520
it gives me the the sensors to figure

632
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,200
out that there's something wrong and

633
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,600
that that's exactly what i need uh i i

634
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,760
need to like know

635
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,360
that i'm like looking for something i

636
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,440
need to have some some alert going off

637
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,200
to figure out there is something out

638
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,080
there i'm trying to figure always out uh

639
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,840
what have we forgotten or like where

640
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,320
don't we look because it's uh i'm here

641
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,480
to like help our businesses do the right

642
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,559
thing and we're all human so they make

643
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,720
mistakes i make mistakes

644
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,159
but i'm trying to find the other

645
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,000
mistakes to fix them before they reach

646
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,159
you

647
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,400
thank you that's uh basically brings us

648
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,640
to the next topic because it's something

649
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,520
that i find quite yes so

650
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,760
we have a few questions in the order

651
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,600
then would you stop send please

652
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,919
microphone to the gentleman

653
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,440
i go first

654
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,679
oh yes hi hi

655
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,520
um i'm wondering if we look at all the

656
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,600
attacks and all the patterns and all the

657
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,279
parts that are in there from all the

658
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,799
different vendors and we look at all

659
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,279
these brilliant minds here which break

660
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,720
all this

661
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,760
what can we do to get this involved in

662
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,760
the company and also get results i mean

663
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,279
that's for me i think it's very

664
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,120
important because i hear

665
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,880
a lot of stories here about people

666
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,360
breaking stuff reporting it to major

667
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,440
companies and they say either thank you

668
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,919
or they say we're not going to fix or no

669
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,200
bounty whatsoever i mean i think you as

670
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,919
companies can use this this crowd in a

671
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,919
brilliant way and i'm i'm wondering how

672
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,799
we can get that more accepted and

673
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,120
and yet work together to fix all the

674
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,279
stuff when it comes out either in parts

675
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,400
either incomplete cars or whatever

676
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,000
anybody want to take this question

677
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,440
ah well

678
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,600
it's nice to see you fighting over

679
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,760
microphone yeah i will send you an email

680
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,799
um

681
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,960
you you get one anyway but um the the

682
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,200
point is that uh i'm here to like learn

683
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,760
what are the what is the

684
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,679
the current level of technology what

685
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,440
what what can we actually break and what

686
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,159
can't we um so if i know that the

687
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,480
deleting of chips and putting an ion

688
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,520
beam on top of it is a thing uh then i

689
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,240
am much more careful of like doing chip

690
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,520
selection

691
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,320
so uh it's for me it's the the to

692
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,400
understand what is uh what you can

693
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,200
reasonably do to keep your products as

694
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,840
safe and secure and the biggest problem

695
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,240
that i see is the backward compatibility

696
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,919
because that sucks so if you have a

697
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,000
product on all products that you can't

698
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,440
upgrade you

699
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,080
memory restriction cpu restrictions

700
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,559
uh even if you get some some vulnerable

701
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,080
disclosure because i i get them

702
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,480
yeah then then you can't necessarily do

703
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,440
something

704
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,679
useful for it sometimes the investment

705
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,080
is just not worth it so i need to like

706
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,039
limit

707
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,360
or balance the the things that you find

708
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,360
and what to break and to make sure that

709
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,679
our future products are safe and secure

710
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,720
but stuff from 2016 might not be so easy

711
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,200
to fix anymore because of like so many

712
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,520
constraints and i of course also have to

713
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,240
like convince my developers that this is

714
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,799
something they must do and they usually

715
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,880
don't necessarily agree with me

716
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,480
so i need to have hard evidence that

717
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,320
this is a real problem that you can fix

718
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,480
easily and that easily is sometimes a

719
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,000
bit more tricky than you think

720
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,200
well i can tell you that already

721
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,279
compiling software from 2012 for a

722
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,600
router is really annoying i just say it

723
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,440
doesn't even compile anymore

724
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,399
just so a little bit i want to add

725
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,320
something for edwin

726
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,880
um i think as i mentioned before this

727
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,360
project scorecard checks for example if

728
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,640
the product has fuzzing of cold scanning

729
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,039
and so on but a metric that i don't know

730
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,600
if he's there yet could be does the

731
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,600
program have a responsible disclosure

732
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,679
does the program has a back bounty does

733
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,039
the people are happy with the back

734
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,480
bounty and these are all factors that

735
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,640
gives you a sort of fingerprint

736
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,640
how the company is a

737
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,720
interest to have security in the product

738
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,679
so i think you make a valid point if the

739
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,360
company has a back bounty program is

740
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,600
paying for vulnerabilities is

741
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,880
doing stuff in this area kudos point no

742
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,840
kudos but points on this

743
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,600
on this company respect of a company

744
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,840
that don't implement this stuff

745
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,000
does it keep this in the cache

746
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,760
no no no question keep this in the cache

747
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,520
of your or your program basically just

748
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,120
put it back because we're going to be

749
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,440
back here in a moment yes

750
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,320
thank you

751
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,799
you've just discussed this idea of

752
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:37,830
having a tool

753
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,039
[Music]

754
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,240
with a

755
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,360
scoring

756
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,000
or something which lists the ingredients

757
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
of software right

758
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,559
but if you would have this

759
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,080
then immediately it becomes the most

760
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,799
valuable link in the supply chain

761
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:59,480
right how do you trust that then

762
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,080
so

763
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,840
that's a good point

764
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,080
um so for example i'm referring to a

765
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,159
software so scorecard is one of the

766
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,440
software but for example you have

767
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,760
another software that i think is called

768
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,640
dependent bot that you give

769
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,720
a software on github and then it's

770
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,799
telling the tree of dependencies that

771
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,480
this software is

772
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,520
uh relying on so libraries tools and so

773
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,279
on and then you have cascade because

774
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,960
also these tools are implementing on

775
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,360
other parts of the supply chain

776
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,919
i think that having this information as

777
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,760
we say is a good step in the right

778
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,960
direction

779
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,760
b

780
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,960
the best now is a failure approach going

781
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,399
better every day

782
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,320
is what we're aiming for we cannot

783
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,960
pretend to be perfect today because

784
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,360
tomorrow maybe you are not so i think

785
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,679
that we need to add the step step step

786
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,000
steps to become all the time i think

787
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,399
that going in this direction checking

788
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,240
the softwares and so on

789
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,039
is where we need to go as for example we

790
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,360
didn't kill buffer overflows

791
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,000
30 years ago how much was it more

792
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,840
really no serious 40 no did we kill them

793
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,559
no no no we didn't kill them

794
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,918
that would have been great news i mean

795
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,840
we achieved something you know

796
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,799
and

797
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,240
that's true if

798
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,200
somebody compromised six store and sorry

799
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,360
scorecard and is giving false results

800
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,520
yeah we need also ways to prevent it

801
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,039
okay any

802
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,480
question that

803
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,880
yeah yeah i i have a brilliant solution

804
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,720
but i also know that if a random person

805
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,080
from the audience says they have a

806
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,279
brilliant solution they're missing

807
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,720
something so i'm wondering what i'm

808
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,000
missing

809
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,559
we're talking a lot about detection here

810
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,559
and you know how do i trust my suppliers

811
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,039
etc

812
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,559
one of the mechanisms we have in the

813
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,720
field of security is partitioning

814
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,240
firewalling

815
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,080
architecting our systems in such a way

816
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,159
that if if there is a compromise it

817
00:30:58,159 --> 00:30:59,679
actually doesn't mean that our full

818
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,080
system is is compromised

819
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,600
so i'm looking for some some thoughts

820
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,960
from you on on

821
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,880
why we don't architect our systems in

822
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,919
such a way to you know to be resistant

823
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,320
to a compromise in our supply

824
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,480
chain it's a fight for the mic um yeah i

825
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,320
like this question um

826
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,640
boss the keynote speaker from yesterday

827
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,039
said like why do we have like these uh

828
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,679
icons and and like a cool names for uh

829
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,240
for vulnerabilities as because cve

830
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,000
numbers don't really like excitement

831
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,279
management

832
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,279
if you have heartbleed and you can

833
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,679
show a powerpoint with like look this is

834
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,679
hot bleed and i think that hardly

835
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,720
started the trend at least for me

836
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,480
maybe there's some something before that

837
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,960
that i don't care about um but hardly

838
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,960
basically told you uh that you have like

839
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,440
a problem in the open ssl libraries

840
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,120
and that was the moment that we all

841
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,799
started thinking but where do we use

842
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,480
this library exactly

843
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,640
we use it like bloody everywhere which

844
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,960
versions do we have and where are they

845
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,760
we have a big ipf 5 router ah that one

846
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,080
also uses openssl that's what we didn't

847
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,200
think about

848
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,279
so an s bomb although you might not be

849
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,120
able to trust it it gives you a starting

850
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,840
point so you can like just google your

851
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,559
own index uh figure out okay openssl is

852
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,240
installed on all of these devices that

853
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,320
you didn't even have a clue about

854
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,720
it gives you a head start to the

855
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,120
competition or even attackers

856
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,039
so you know like what you need to patch

857
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,320
before

858
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,679
before the vulnerability is widespread

859
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,360
and that's what i think is important to

860
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,120
have this detectability to know like

861
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,120
what type of stuff that you have but

862
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,640
also like where

863
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,240
to have this radar out to figure out

864
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,600
what's going wrong

865
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,000
what do you try to sell now it's the

866
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,320
what's your product idea

867
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,159
oh um

868
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,240
i i wouldn't call it a product idea but

869
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,480
um

870
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,960
and i don't know if heartbleed is the

871
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,919
um

872
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,000
so with heartbleed the

873
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,480
um i guess my question is

874
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,080
why

875
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,519
let's say that you're given a heartbleed

876
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,120
type of vulnerability why can't we

877
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,360
isolate that somehow to a smaller part

878
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,120
of our system rather than it just

879
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,039
meaning a full compromise of you know

880
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,760
the device that's that that ssl library

881
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,039
is running on

882
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,799
like how can we you know limit the

883
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,200
damage

884
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,799
i think there's a question at the back

885
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,399
yes no please

886
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:29,840
um so legislation like gdpr made

887
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,279
hoarding a lot of data more of a

888
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,799
liability

889
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,200
rather than just you know more data is

890
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,360
better do we see any opportunities for

891
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,519
legislation to

892
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:40,320
make

893
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,399
you know relying on 500 external

894
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,720
dependencies more expensive

895
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,799
so that you know

896
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,200
so the people don't import package for

897
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,200
every one line of code

898
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,720
they're right

899
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,360
yeah so i think that's at least that is

900
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,760
the legislation could help in getting

901
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,880
more information more data to evaluate

902
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,640
i say at least impacts and

903
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,120
the the attack rate actually even

904
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,280
counting what just david was saying do

905
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,320
you think that that may help

906
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,839
any hope there

907
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,960
should i translate it from italian you

908
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,839
know what what

909
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,560
yes

910
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,639
i'm not an expert in legislation and

911
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,960
what are your beliefs there any hope

912
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,719
gdpr for example for privacy

913
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:42,239
i think is putting awareness in both

914
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,279
people and

915
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,440
and also

916
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,399
companies that are ending this date

917
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:51,599
so

918
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,440
maybe regulating

919
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,599
some responsibilities for

920
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,280
supply chain for your product

921
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,040
could be something

922
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,119
but at the moment is the first time that

923
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,880
uh i'm not i'm

924
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,920
i'm not in this field of uh legislation

925
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,280
and so on so

926
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,440
i think would be a good idea

927
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,240
but

928
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,480
i have no clue on that in the future for

929
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,200
me

930
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,720
it's not i'm not the right person for

931
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,319
this type to add anything

932
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,280
no comments

933
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,839
i i love legislation especially to stay

934
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,240
away from that

935
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,400
etsy 303 645

936
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,599
that's a standard for consumer iot and

937
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,680
cyber security and there were talks last

938
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,920
year if it should become a law and they

939
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,000
figured out probably

940
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,320
the way it's written it's good advice

941
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,079
but not necessarily this is something

942
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,599
you must do and otherwise we will kill

943
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:46,800
your company

944
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,280
um i i feel very strongly about the ls

945
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,359
you might have like heard that from my

946
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,680
open ssl heartbleed

947
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,800
passion

948
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,560
one of the things in this etsy standard

949
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,760
is a thing called communicate securely

950
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,200
and i i really struggle to to get tls

951
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,440
connections uh because of the route of

952
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,400
trust so in my own home my own router

953
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,000
doesn't trust me if i'm trying to

954
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,640
connect to it

955
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,640
this is like a problem and it is not a

956
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,800
problem that you can like put into law

957
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,720
and then it will fix i need a supplier

958
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,119
to provide me some type of route of

959
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,000
trust

960
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,240
for this specific use case

961
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,000
tls is really uh

962
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,040
invented to do banking on the internet

963
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,640
in the 90s

964
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,000
that that's what the whole model that

965
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,880
the pkr model is based on uh on this

966
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,119
moment in browsers of course if you go

967
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,720
outside of browsers you can do whatever

968
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,040
you want and have your own roots

969
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,240
but like

970
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,400
my thing is uh does grandma understand

971
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,359
this

972
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,839
and then it's a different story so

973
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,680
communicating securely is one of these

974
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,839
things should we make it into law and i

975
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,839
would like to but i don't see how you

976
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:55,920
can phrase it in such a way that you can

977
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,760
force

978
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,400
vendors to to make stuff that actually

979
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,320
communicate securely because what is

980
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,599
secure

981
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,960
if you slap a tls certificate on it who

982
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,119
who will sign it who is allowed to sign

983
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:09,839
it

984
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,720
it's a it's a an enormous enormously big

985
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,640
problem if you ask me

986
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,720
if i may add something here is that my

987
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,320
moderator try to stay away from

988
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,240
discussion in general but

989
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,400
i think the question here could be yes

990
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,400
we need secure product but the question

991
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,960
is that secure for whom

992
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,560
because i mean there are many parties

993
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,720
involved over here that

994
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,720
want to secure their assets

995
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,040
so there is not only the user security

996
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,520
module in the industry there is also

997
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,200
other part of the initially trying to

998
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,800
see your ips trying to secure let's say

999
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,040
confidentiality ownership business you

1000
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,480
know and they all basically overlapping

1001
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,520
on a same device so when you say this

1002
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,200
mobile phone needs to be secure for

1003
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,680
example but secure for

1004
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,880
who

1005
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,280
at this point i think we have a

1006
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,920
few questions

1007
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,119
we can take a couple more i think that

1008
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,119
then we need to probably

1009
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,040
so what i was getting at if you uh sell

1010
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,359
a car that turns out to not be safe you

1011
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,040
have to issue a recall to fix the

1012
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,079
problem

1013
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,920
if you if you release some iot product

1014
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,240
that ends up doing damage to society or

1015
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,480
to to your customers should we have

1016
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,320
strong regulation to then fix the

1017
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,440
problem

1018
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,079
and that way incentivize the company to

1019
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,880
make a secure product rather than

1020
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,000
making regulations on how to do that

1021
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,599
yeah okay

1022
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,520
any i think i've seen a couple of

1023
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,040
questions at least there

1024
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,400
yeah i have another question um

1025
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,560
i was thinking about um

1026
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,400
we were a lot of talking a lot about

1027
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,839
dependencies and are there any studies

1028
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:48,560
in

1029
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,200
that we know about that if a dependency

1030
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,599
causes more harm if it gets infected or

1031
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,920
if we do that part of the dependency on

1032
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,480
our own so that would mean like json

1033
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,200
parsing implemented over and over again

1034
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,280
and having the same issues again but

1035
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,160
also

1036
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,000
that the issues are different in every

1037
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,280
implementation

1038
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,079
so

1039
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,000
is there any

1040
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,640
yep thank you anybody would like to

1041
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,839
address this

1042
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,680
so it's about we have a dependency

1043
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,839
implemented and is that dependency

1044
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,800
causing more harm by being implemented

1045
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,160
and then maybe infected or it causes it

1046
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,760
more harm to

1047
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,240
implement the same thing again over and

1048
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,920
over again

1049
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,880
so

1050
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,880
that you would have a different issue in

1051
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,200
every implementation so

1052
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,320
but

1053
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,040
if the dependency that you use for that

1054
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,599
for example json parsing gets infected

1055
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,079
and maybe a dozen companies are using

1056
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:50,079
that so a dozen companies get infected

1057
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,720
at the same time

1058
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,920
you're saying libraries are

1059
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,520
fundamentally bad

1060
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,560
i'm thinking about it

1061
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,839
anybody knows about this

1062
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,160
i'm not sure to grasp the question

1063
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,640
correctly so let's say that i'm choosing

1064
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,880
a library for python json let's sticks

1065
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,720
on the same example and then this

1066
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,400
library is

1067
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,800
compromised by someone that has the same

1068
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,720
credentials that steal the credentials

1069
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,200
from github or whatever and add i don't

1070
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,560
know a crypto miner or whatever else

1071
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,240
the point from here what is your

1072
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,839
question the the following part

1073
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:33,280
my point is just

1074
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,920
do we know if it's better to choose the

1075
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,000
library or to implement a json parsing

1076
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,440
on our own okay

1077
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,079
okay now i got your question

1078
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,640
so i think that

1079
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,040
at the beginning of

1080
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,720
this week

1081
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,920
there was a npm package that was

1082
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,680
compromised and was cooked in two hours

1083
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,800
so

1084
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,640
anyhow it seems there are mechanisms to

1085
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,520
spot this thing

1086
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:04,960
if you have

1087
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,640
developers in your company and you ask

1088
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,440
them to implement this library

1089
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,960
could be a thing

1090
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,920
but is economically sustainable

1091
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,760
also for the company so sometimes you

1092
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,920
need to rely on third parties

1093
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,720
i'm a huge fan of open source software

1094
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,560
because you have a lot of eyes looking

1095
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,079
at it and so on

1096
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,680
maybe we need more

1097
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,760
better solutions to protect open source

1098
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,800
software

1099
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,079
so

1100
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:31,839
like implementing two factor

1101
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:34,400
authentications on all the accounts of

1102
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,079
the developers so there is this

1103
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,400
framework that is called salsa that you

1104
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,560
have different levels from one to five

1105
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,040
or one to four i don't remember that for

1106
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,839
example every commit that is made to the

1107
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,000
product should be approved by two

1108
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,280
reviewers

1109
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,119
so i think there are steps in that

1110
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:52,560
direction

1111
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,960
and as a company you cannot write all

1112
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,440
the software around otherwise

1113
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,359
yeah the company needs a lot of money to

1114
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:00,800
rewrite so

1115
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,880
i am a big sustainer open source we need

1116
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,880
ways to make in my opinion open source

1117
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,960
more stronger for example by this

1118
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,680
framework satsa that is developing now i

1119
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,680
don't know if anybody else on the table

1120
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,640
have something to say on that no

1121
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,839
i don't know if i have stories your

1122
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,640
question okay

1123
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,839
so on that topic and to tie this into

1124
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,079
the panel from uh yesterday

1125
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:27,760
uh is it

1126
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,440
is open source a a better way forward

1127
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,920
for dealing with supply chains both in

1128
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,280
open source hardware and open source

1129
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,520
software where we can use things like

1130
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,440
this software bill of materials where we

1131
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,319
can actually have uh dependency scanning

1132
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,960
that gives the both the developer and

1133
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,280
the end user visibility into everything

1134
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,440
that goes into it rather than having the

1135
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,880
vendors say

1136
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,200
uh trust us and we are transitively

1137
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,200
trusting all of our vendors

1138
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,240
uh

1139
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,640
so the question for the panel is is open

1140
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,880
source fundamentally a better way to

1141
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,640
deal with the hardware and software

1142
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,279
supply chain

1143
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,319
yeah i love open source because i can

1144
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,800
see how the code looks like but i think

1145
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,319
it's a common

1146
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,000
misunderstanding that therefore your

1147
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,480
code is being audited by millions

1148
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,560
there's an opportunity for millions to

1149
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,400
look at your code but there's also

1150
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,440
billions of lines of codes to audit

1151
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,920
sometimes i see open source project

1152
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,839
projects and that's more for personal

1153
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:32,319
use than business that are really really

1154
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,960
crap and the question is do i spend my

1155
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,400
time fixing these

1156
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,359
things or do i just use it as it is and

1157
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,520
i i don't have time

1158
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,760
outside in my personal life to like fix

1159
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,160
everybody's code so i just go with the

1160
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,480
flow

1161
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,640
yeah sorry one more thing open source is

1162
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,200
great go for it

1163
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,520
so let me add to this to jump to the

1164
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,160
next question to open um some different

1165
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,240
perspectives so well it seems clear from

1166
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,760
the discussion even from the questions

1167
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,839
that we're asking for in a way

1168
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,160
processes that may help from the vendor

1169
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,880
side in order to

1170
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,880
respond vulnerabilities prevent

1171
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,720
vulnerabilities i'm thinking about free

1172
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,960
aging internal research back boundaries

1173
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,119
on the side responding like it's in a

1174
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,119
response the average time to fix and

1175
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:20,880
patch all these things so this this kind

1176
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,119
of processes and a few

1177
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,760
more being mentioned here are actually

1178
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,200
fundamental

1179
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,000
for

1180
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,640
the maintenance of security of a product

1181
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,000
because i mean

1182
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,160
we know that a product is secure or can

1183
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,040
be secure acceptable at a certain time

1184
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,839
but after some time yeah people find

1185
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,000
vulnerability you need to have a process

1186
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,160
that help you helps you to maintain the

1187
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,520
ct level

1188
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,520
now given all these processes are so

1189
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,520
fundamental we are

1190
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,599
suddenly in a way

1191
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,040
stuck to fixing devices to certifying

1192
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:59,280
devices to saying this device is secure

1193
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,040
don't you think that maybe we should

1194
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,200
start certifying vendors

1195
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,680
for the process they have for example do

1196
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,760
they have an sdlc

1197
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,720
or secure software development lifecycle

1198
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,400
do you actually audit their code is

1199
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,560
there a regular

1200
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,560
source code reviews and testing of the

1201
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,359
final product in how much time do they

1202
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:22,079
respond to fixing a vulnerability do

1203
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,240
they have bug bounty do they have an

1204
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,119
internal security research

1205
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:29,040
my question is that

1206
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,079
wouldn't make sense certifying a vendors

1207
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,400
that has this process for

1208
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,920
all these products rather than

1209
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,960
certifying only each products every time

1210
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,280
at every iteration in every edition

1211
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,160
you

1212
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,560
will be certifying the maintenance of

1213
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,319
security of a product rather than the

1214
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,000
security of the device or the problem at

1215
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:48,960
the end

1216
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,839
does it make sense

1217
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,880
what i'm asking or please santos you

1218
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,400
would like to add your review here

1219
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,400
well to be honest i

1220
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,040
i don't have a

1221
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,079
nice experience with uh certification

1222
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,160
and certified products i think nobody

1223
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,760
has that

1224
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,280
honestly

1225
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,960
and then i guess

1226
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,040
your idea is beautiful

1227
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,880
on paper

1228
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,440
but let's say that

1229
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,319
your company and the process that your

1230
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:24,960
company follows are certified

1231
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,000
who tells me that after you get that

1232
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,240
certification you will keep doing the

1233
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,520
same

1234
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,160
is there gonna be like uh

1235
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,440
one person there tracking that your

1236
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,560
employers employees are following that

1237
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,480
that procedures

1238
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,480
in the end i will need to keep trusting

1239
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,240
you yeah i get your point let me

1240
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,839
rephrase the question then

1241
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:50,000
would it make sense that we evaluate or

1242
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,640
we measure the quality of a vendor that

1243
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,359
adjusts the quality of a product

1244
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:57,040
so let's put a certification aside

1245
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,960
because maybe may trigger a few main

1246
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,240
points here

1247
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,720
but does it make sense that we say okay

1248
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,280
this vendor is more trustworthy because

1249
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,079
they do a b c and e and this is a bit

1250
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:10,000
less trans-worthy because they don't

1251
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,200
have it

1252
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,280
i mean would it make sense that we start

1253
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,359
judging not only products but even

1254
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:17,040
processes behind

1255
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,560
example is that

1256
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,599
i know from vendor x that they actually

1257
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,599
pro they declare that they have support

1258
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:26,319
for five years of product updates it's

1259
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:28,079
written you when you buy it

1260
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,559
you buy the product along with this

1261
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:33,040
support if i don't see that that's an

1262
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,520
example right to explain what i'm asking

1263
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,599
if i don't see that then i don't know

1264
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:39,520
how long this is going to last maybe i'm

1265
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,839
buying the product now and in two years

1266
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:43,920
i don't have it i need to change it

1267
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,720
which for me as a consumer is a

1268
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,280
uh annoying but for as i don't know

1269
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,200
critical infrastructure is critical

1270
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,280
that's why it's critical basically does

1271
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,640
it make sense that we start using this

1272
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,400
approach towards vendors rather than

1273
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,280
only

1274
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,359
devices or products

1275
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:00,319
in the end

1276
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:02,400
yes sure makes sense

1277
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,680
but still not sure that

1278
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,160
it will remove the fact that

1279
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,040
i will have to somehow trust you that

1280
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,599
just you keep doing what you you claimed

1281
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:17,040
you do yeah no that is clear yes uh so

1282
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,480
if anybody would like to add anything on

1283
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,280
this uh specific question

1284
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,280
one thing so a certification is

1285
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,559
important because it gives you a

1286
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:26,559
baseline it gives you an understanding a

1287
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:28,800
look into the kitchen or at least like a

1288
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,640
view of the kitchen in the most

1289
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,280
beautiful circumstances so when it has

1290
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,599
been cleaned if an auditor comes in you

1291
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,760
can basically tell them okay look look

1292
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,680
at how nice and clean everything is our

1293
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,520
processes are fine we do all this pen

1294
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,559
testing

1295
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,079
we have these processes in place

1296
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:46,640
everybody knows what they're doing

1297
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,480
but of course sometimes you have fire in

1298
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,040
the kitchen so let's not uh forget about

1299
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:51,839
that

1300
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:54,079
um when i worked for ericsson we had the

1301
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:58,640
iso's 27 000 certification again

1302
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,480
and the auditors came and they didn't

1303
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,880
find anything and the security uh

1304
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,119
director he was very upset because how

1305
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:06,960
can you not find anything it's like

1306
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,319
there's no added value to the

1307
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:11,119
certificate if you don't look well

1308
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,520
um so my point is that like it's not

1309
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,960
that we have so much crap that i'm

1310
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,400
trying to hide from you

1311
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,359
it is like that when you try to to make

1312
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,680
software and mistakes are made and you

1313
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,040
fix those mistakes before they're

1314
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,079
released

1315
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:27,280
uh that doesn't count uh it is like you

1316
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,079
were on time to to grab it we are not

1317
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:32,800
all geniuses unfortunately so these

1318
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,079
mistakes happen

1319
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:35,920
uh but if you catch it in time before

1320
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,240
it's released and uh i love your

1321
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,559
previous uh comment about recalls

1322
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:42,559
um if you have a car and it is being

1323
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:44,319
recalled do you think oh this is really

1324
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:46,160
great i have to go to the garage and

1325
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,160
have something fixed

1326
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,400
uh i think that like as a as a world we

1327
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,319
need to accept that like they are

1328
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:54,160
actually fixing a problem so that you

1329
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,559
don't die so this is actually great okay

1330
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,079
it costs you a bit of time to go to the

1331
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,240
garage and with software patching you

1332
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,800
can actually push it it's a lot

1333
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,400
nicer because

1334
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,800
you might not notice it but on the other

1335
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,880
hand like if i look at my wife she says

1336
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,720
like windows updates do i have to

1337
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,880
install them yes you do

1338
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,480
yes you do

1339
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,960
yep we have time for the last couple of

1340
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,559
questions here a couple of presents and

1341
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:21,839
then we are going to wrap it up

1342
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:23,520
okay so

1343
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,839
um as

1344
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:28,720
a person or a company who buys security

1345
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:29,760
products

1346
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,800
and

1347
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,280
i would be very happy if a supplier

1348
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,960
could could show me

1349
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,280
that they have a process in place

1350
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,359
where they try to mitigate supply chain

1351
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:41,760
attacks and we heard we heard

1352
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,599
quite some good suggestions from from

1353
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:46,480
the audience like

1354
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:49,520
we should have for example

1355
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,480
during design already technical measures

1356
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,960
that reduce the risks

1357
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,359
um you could you could have big bounties

1358
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:59,119
you know after

1359
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:02,079
uh something has been found and and to

1360
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:03,680
to patch stuff

1361
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:07,200
um open source would be an idea

1362
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,359
so so there's a lot of measures you can

1363
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:10,240
take

1364
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,920
and as a

1365
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,680
yeah as a company that buys security

1366
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:17,359
products i would like to see suppliers

1367
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:21,200
to prove to me that they have these

1368
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,280
measures in place somehow that they

1369
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,119
thought about this and

1370
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:26,960
they reduced the risk as much as

1371
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,880
possible

1372
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,240
