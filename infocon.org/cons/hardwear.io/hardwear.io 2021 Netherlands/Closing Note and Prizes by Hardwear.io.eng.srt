1
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:05,839
so the fourth time that we we came here

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,240
with a a new ctf because every time we

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,080
renew all the challenge from the heart

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,120
of the cdf this year was done with my

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,640
colleague antonie relier and daniel

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,240
to go back

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,359
home for

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,560
family issues

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,279
so we had to as usual many different

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:26,880
challenges on

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,840
same things like pcb reverse rfid stuff

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,480
automotive zigbee this year which was

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,680
new

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,239
um we had also micro soldering and you

15
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,079
see

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,000
there's a microscope

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,399
solving very tiny wires over there

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,079
all right good places

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,840
and the nfc challenges as well and ble

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,280
so

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,960
quite a number of different categories

22
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,440
as you can see over there

23
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,440
why we do that mostly because we want

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,680
people of course to have fun but also to

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,480
learn

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,600
new techniques in the process new tools

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,680
new technologies

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,479
we got this year nine team who scored at

29
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,200
least one of the challenge

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,320
and in total almost all of our

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,479
challenges were

32
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,640
got solved

33
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,200
the last one got broken like 10 minutes

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,799
before the end

35
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,200
so that's the scoreboard

36
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,040
one or before the end

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,200
and they still don't know who's with the

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,799
winner because as you can see there was

39
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,670
a big fight there at the end

40
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,280
[Music]

41
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,600
and we we come and we organize the ctf

42
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,840
but we don't have any price

43
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,079
uh hopefully hardware

44
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,360

i'm also going to call out jasper to

256
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,160
come because when i was doing hardware

257
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,360
dot io in 2015 was my planning stage and

258
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,399
uh

259
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,040
we got connected and then uh he spoke to

260
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,399
me on the phone we got onto a call

261
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,560
inside explaining what a side channel

262
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,240
analysis and side channel attacks and

263
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,279
following

264
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,279
i was like this guy can really explain

265
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,839
to some dumb person like me so yeah and

266
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,360
he's been on a review board he's been

267
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,399
selecting helping us go uh all the

268
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,560
papers that we have so just for over to

269
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,480
you

270
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,880
so i have to say i i opt out of scoring

271
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,000
my own talk so yeah i just i just have

272
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,519
to bribe him

273
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,680
um yeah i don't know what to say really

274
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,600
i think um yeah we've

275
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,200
known each other for years now and i

276
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,279
think uh had good conversations about

277
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,040
where to take this conference because

278
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,880
when you start a conference it's like

279
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,839
okay cool we're going to start a

280
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,240
conference but what why right

281
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,000
i think one of the things we i i

282
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
remember was

283
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,600
we're talking about how many offensive

284
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,839
part the conferences there already worth

285
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,600
like maybe we should actually you know

286
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,000
get some defensive perspective in there

287
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,959
as well

288
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,279
