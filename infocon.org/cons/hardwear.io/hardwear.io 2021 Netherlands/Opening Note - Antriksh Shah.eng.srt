19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,719
and

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,640
i would say uh we had a lot of

21
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,960
challenges and a lot of feedback i would

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,600
like to start with when we did a couple

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,199
of online conferences and online

24
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,199
trainings people really enjoyed it there

25
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,480
was a certain set of people found it

26
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,239
really comfortable sitting at home

27
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,559
attending talks in their own free time

28
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,879
uh having their own favorite privileges

29
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,640
uh that we couldn't serve at the

30
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,119
conference in the daytime uh we got

31
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,960
feedback from some of our sponsors as

32
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,400
well that hey when will you do the next

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,400
physical conference and it was

34
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,240
challenging uh

35
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,759
andrea's sitting standing over there

36
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:16,720
behind

37
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,720
she and i have been having multiple

38
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,159
discussions on how do we do this

39
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,200
physically

40
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,479
we had issues like uncertainty in the

41
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,680
pandemic situation uh there are a few

42
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,079
people sitting in the uh in the hall

43
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,159
that we mentioned that

44
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,799
we may cancel the october event and we

45
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,320
may do it in december uh but and andrea

46
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,840
kept discussing it again and again and

47
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,880
then

48
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,880
i think at the end we put our foot down

49
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,960
and we said it let's see how what

50
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,079
happens we do it in october itself uh

51
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,200
so yeah we had challenges uh

52
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,240
also

53
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,920
some feedback was that let's do it

54
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,399
hybrid and i think both of us didn't

55
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,000

57
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,320
hands and yeah so we said let's do it

58
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,759
hybrid uh physical uh

59
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,759

the team from india couldn't travel uh

138
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,280
because of the visas were not issued to

139
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,000
them and i think

140
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,240
it was difficult for them also to figure

141
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,479
