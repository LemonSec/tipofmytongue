2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,180
for me estas and together with Laila we

3
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,039
have been working for a long amount of

4
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:19,930
time in the field of hardware security

5
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,330
so for the last six or seven years we

6
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,650
have been working together in the

7
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:27,759
Netherlands on this field so the goal of

8
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:30,189
this webinar today is for me to give you

9
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:33,130
a quick introduction into physical

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:33,640
attacks

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,430
what are physical attacks what can they

12
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,700
do why should we worry or can they do

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,110
any harm or how should we protect

14
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,230
against them and of course I also want

15
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,240
you to give you some information on the

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,850
course that we are having in hardware IO

17
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,610
and we have been keeping with keep on

18
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,410
doing this for the last couple of years

19
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,360
it's called embedded physical attacks

20
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:02,280
101 so let me get right on to it

21
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,600
three main questions that I would like

22
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,730
to low let's say discuss with you and

23
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,730
during this webinar the very first one

24
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,160
is how did we get here how did we get to

25
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,170
the point where physical security and

26
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,820
physical effect are important in the

27
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,729
lifecycle of the device and

28
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:30,680
interestingly enough this relates a lot

29
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,810
to the history of cryptography from the

30
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:40,430
70s up until almost today and a quick

31
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,850
trip down memory lane very quick trip

32
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,310
down memory lane so that you can take a

33
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,930
look and see how did we end up with this

34
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,670
line of attack and how much harm they

35
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,100
can do the second question that I will

36
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,050
try to answer is what are the physical

37
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,210
attacks and we will see that there are

38
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:58,910
two main let's say types of such attacks

39
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,250
one of them is side-channel attacks and

40
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,840
the second one is fault injection

41
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,880
attacks we will talk about briefly about

42
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,800
both and finally the last question do

43
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,410
power in scores what are the

44
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,410
prerequisites and of course what do you

45
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,489
need to know and what you should expect

46
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:21,470
all right so let's get going with the

47
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,360
very first question is how did we get to

48
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,980
the point of physical security is

49
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:31,730
important ok so I will start a bit with

50
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,580
let's say but some time ago in the 70s

51
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,500
and 80s well that was a time of

52
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,260
rock'n'roll but also it marked the birth

53
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,170
of modern cryptography it's quite

54
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,209
interesting because many of the early

55
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:46,549
cryptographic designs they surfaced in

56
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:50,540
during that era vs RSA and many other

57
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,360
structures were proposed at that time in

58
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,500
75 and 77 and of course that was the

59
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,870
beginning of our field the beginning of

60
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:04,430
security in many ways and people started

61
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,650
analyzing those mathematical structures

62
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,790
at that time it was even more

63
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,230
interesting that was the era where

64
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:15,170
things became increasingly more often so

65
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:19,010
what used to be let's say the field of

66
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:21,739
the military or Secret Service's it kind

67
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:23,510
of moved more into the public sphere of

68
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,390
influence so therefore we moved from

69
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,600
approaches and to an open community not

70
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,520
an academic community that was in favor

71
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,450
of prep analysis so at that time the

72
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:40,900
workflow of a cryptographer or quite

73
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,910
well not gonna say it was easy but it

74
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,040
was straightforward if you construct the

75
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,560
cipher and you here to make sure that it

76
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,150
resists mathematical attacks and of

77
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,130
course you had to convince other people

78
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:56,020
about it and that RSA was let's say

79
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,280
solidly based in a mathematical problem

80
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,350
but des in many cases did not make all

81
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:06,230
right the last part and probably the

82
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:11,510
more interesting news one is what are we

83
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,840
trying to do with it then back in in all

84
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,760
the times there was just a mainframe

85
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,560
that it would rest there for every user

86
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,620
so at that time the goal was let's build

87
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,240
some good cryptography the goal was not

88
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,040
so much let's implement it efficiently

89
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,380
or let's implement it securely we

90
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,460
focused more on the fury

91
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,440
now taking the next step into this

92
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,260
discussion Prague Rafi in the 90s and

93
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,710
2000 it moved in a different direction

94
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:44,100
music music so in this era which is

95
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,050
closer to my age we have the widespread

96
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,900
but say effects of personal computing

97
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,460
which were becoming more and more

98
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,530
evident the Internet even more popular

99
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,630
connections to so and so forth and at

100
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,810
this time security evolved with it so

101
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,660
suddenly everyone had his own computer

102
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,520
everything was connected on the network

103
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,620
and of course every computer was

104
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,540
vulnerable at this time you can use

105
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,740
wrong encryption to protect everyone so

106
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,300
this was the consensus that people

107
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,790
reached in the 90s and every device

108
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,710
should be well adequately protected with

109
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,930
something that is built-in and

110
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,010
effectively rips data with him all this

111
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,980
effort to piled up and built the

112
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,669
advanced encryption standard in 1998

113
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:38,660
what is quite interesting in this design

114
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,270
the first time people started

115
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,850
considering not only the Crypt was a

116
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,960
mathematical you know an abstract

117
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,150
theoretical concept but as something

118
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,979
that you put in a device and used to be

119
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:52,080
efficiently implemented that was the

120
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,610
first time that this became very evident

121
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:59,010
of course so it should be both your

122
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:02,520
inefficient and the workflow of the

123
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,590
cryptographer or the security guys like

124
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,350
it shifted a bit of course you need the

125
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:07,970
side

126
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,759
[Music]

127
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:13,349
mathematical facts but for the first

128
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:14,729
time you may need to make sure its faste

129
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:17,220
and that you put it on your personal

130
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,810
computer and there are any other

131
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:23,099
computer around or laughs so that was

132
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:27,090
let's say the 90s and we had more solid

133
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,860
foundations and we moved more into the

134
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,229
hardware side of things more closer to

135
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:38,030
the physical aspects if you will finally

136
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,710
we reached the modern days so what about

137
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:44,490
the cryptography in 2010 and 2020 so

138
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:47,250
then cryptography and had the whole

139
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,380
computing paradigm shifted to let's say

140
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:54,270
more pop feeling I would say so we used

141
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,190
to be that everyone had his own computer

142
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,990
but now every little device that

143
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,509
everyone would access constantly was

144
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:02,280
suddenly connected to the Internet and

145
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,080
in needed protections for not only your

146
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,080
computer but now your smartphone every

147
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,020
little sensor in the Internet of Things

148
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,969
so with much more intense popular

149
00:07:11,969 --> 00:07:14,669
feeling all those devices all those

150
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:16,620
embedded devices were always online and

151
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,520
they were endless so many of those and

152
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,590
as this shifted we also started using

153
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,919
smart phones smart cards dongles RFID

154
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,599
transport cards that we used to go into

155
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,199
the past every day and every one of them

156
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,830
had written later and more importantly

157
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,539
every one was often two attacks you

158
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:41,819
could try to attract but card you were

159
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:43,590
the user and the attacker at this time

160
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,259
it was actually quite interesting the

161
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:48,719
workflow changed a lot you still were

162
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:51,330
living through photography it should be

163
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,580
resistant it should be very efficient

164
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,190
but now it's going to be distributed to

165
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,479
everyone it's gonna be from every

166
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:00,120
imaginable device and it's gonna go to

167
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,800
everyone but users for instance the

168
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,810
drain system or an ATM machine Agra fee

169
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,710
like

170
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,870
[Music]

171
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,680
this was them in my mindset at least it

172
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,870
was the breaking point it was the point

173
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,040
where some some device was very easy and

174
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,380
everyone could try hardware hacking so

175
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,320
what used to be let's say sphere of some

176
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,900
very specialized people became much more

177
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,570
open due to the be given availability of

178
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:34,179
devices and many people gave a strong

179
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:38,159
Network try to have many devices and

180
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,440
more in main products were found in

181
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,400
super under when put under scrutiny so

182
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,380
just to mention a few examples that are

183
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,870
quite notable in the community the Xbox

184
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,630
had serious hardware security issues I

185
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:55,510
do recall people modifying PlayStation

186
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:58,720
chip so that we can play games a TV was

187
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,640
affected a lot because many people

188
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,690
managed to do physical acts of a TV

189
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,700
essentially watch it for free and of

190
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,000
course this helped that smart brothers

191
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,720
well so on the right one hand here it's

192
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,960
quite important because it is the Dutch

193
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,790
transport card which was hacked quite

194
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,370
some time ago and of course you can

195
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,960
write for free if you use it carefully

196
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,890
now so that's where we are

197
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:29,890
we everything became really available

198
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,420
and people trying to find hawks and

199
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:36,610
issues in it now the next step is we've

200
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,010
seen that this attacks exist they can

201
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:42,160
target real world devices my next point

202
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,850
now is what exactly do they do and what

203
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:52,120
exactly can you expect so as I said we

204
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,450
have lines one of them is a channel

205
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,910
thanks so the second one is fault

206
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:03,910
injection tell the best way to describe

207
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,010
side channel attacks is with a good

208
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,930
example so I want you to take a look at

209
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,690
this little piece of code the input of

210
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:13,900
this code is a four digit PIN code and

211
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,560
the output is a yes or no is the pin

212
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,160
verified or is enriching so even though

213
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,200
the process and perhaps you're not very

214
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,730
good programmer for instance and you

215
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,680
build a very strange process which is a

216
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,339
bit like that

217
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:30,010
it's a bunch of one two three four

218
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:33,850
nested loops and let's try to see what

219
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,040
it does so you have an outer check if

220
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:43,180
the pin is 0 is equal to 9 if the 0 if

221
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,820
the third digit is 2 then if all the

222
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,339
chicks are met you are in the final part

223
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:50,080
of the nested loop and the pin is okay

224
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,660
otherwise the pin is 0 which means not

225
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,390
ok and what is interesting about this

226
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,430
example is that this little piece of

227
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,220
code although strange it's functionally

228
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,620
correct it does the pin check it gets

229
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,110
the job done however it may be

230
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:09,339
vulnerable in ways that did not predict

231
00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:13,660
the past so if you become a little more

232
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,710
clearance you may try to you know try

233
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,780
pins yourself so what would be the

234
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:23,050
execution time or if you try like a pin

235
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,410
code 0 1 2 3 and you will end up here

236
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,900
and in the very first it's pollution you

237
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,390
will fail so probably that will run for

238
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,000
some time but it looks good long now

239
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,250
what happens if you get the first digit

240
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:41,589
correct then 5 you will fail in the

241
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:43,420
second loop so it will take a bit more

242
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,760
and what if you get more digits right

243
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,910
and in the end you're gonna figure out

244
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,920
that as you get closer to the correct

245
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,730
which is 5 9 0 to your execution time

246
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:57,730
becomes higher and higher so you have a

247
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,160
perfectly correct piece of code in the

248
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,980
sense that it does the job yet there is

249
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,690
what we call a side channel some

250
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,680
accidental information like

251
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:13,420
- which reveals information about the

252
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,770
secret or the secret awesome

253
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:22,450
so just to define it a little bit aside

254
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,210
signal logic will observe data from the

255
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,700
physical device and then it will use it

256
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,520
to bypass security so you may have a

257
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,580
graphic device that does a s or DES for

258
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:37,450
RSA in a perfectly sound way in the

259
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:40,750
sense that a es is mathematically secure

260
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,840
however once you put it in the device so

261
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,830
you know you move away from the

262
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,780
seventies in the eighties and going to

263
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,120
the nineties and modern day and you hear

264
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,580
things inside the device that is rests

265
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,160
on the palm of your hand then you can

266
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,960
start observing the data and you can

267
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,820
start using this data this accidental

268
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:03,220
data to bypass your security so finally

269
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,950
the workflow needs to change and it's

270
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:12,130
this reflects upon the changes it has to

271
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,080
be good cipher but you also need to be

272
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,690
sure that it will resist such accidental

273
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,370
leakages it will resist side-channel

274
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,100
attacks as we know and of course once

275
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,130
you do that then you can give a certain

276
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,810
security guarantees that even if you

277
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:29,350
hand out those devices to everyone it's

278
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,860
still quite hard into them and the key

279
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:37,290
or blown them or do similar things

280
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,770
first we discussed about execution time

281
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:45,240
they're even more popular side-channel

282
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,790
techniques that involve our consumption

283
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,630
electromagnetic emissions of the device

284
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:53,050
so typically what I like to show is a

285
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:56,740
simple device like that so here you can

286
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,900
see a microchip and here you see a small

287
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:03,940
antenna at rest and while AES is being

288
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,250
executed our consumption is being

289
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:10,690
measured and you can see this here so in

290
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:13,240
this context it's actually quite

291
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,120
interesting to see that even small

292
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,390
variations and statistics I can help you

293
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,520
find the secret key just by observing

294
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,110
those fluctuations over time and we do

295
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,760
have assignments of that during the

296
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,810
during our course

297
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:36,320
earth move now to the second part the

298
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,800
fault injection part and once again like

299
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,540
inside channels let me give you yet

300
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,150
another example so let's say that you

301
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:47,150
want to let's see do an aes encryption

302
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:50,600
for certain plaintext over here and what

303
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,460
you have to do is to go for ten rounds

304
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,400
and do the pieces of the AES software

305
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,520
around PS books shift row speaks and

306
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,860
finally you are able to produce the

307
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,700
ciphertext

308
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:06,770
now what if this is a biggest what if

309
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:11,350
you can a little bit with the voltage

310
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:14,660
just enough at the right time hopefully

311
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,120
so that this variable instead of you

312
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,860
know going to from one until can get

313
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,770
stuck at zero what if this would happen

314
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:25,040
then essentially your for loop is done

315
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,220
and there is absolutely no introduction

316
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,900
at all essentially you're able to bypass

317
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:35,710
es encryption so fault injection attack

318
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:38,360
is an attack that alters the data and

319
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,000
the physical device uses this data to

320
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,180
bypass security it's a bit more active

321
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,870
compared to size and of course now the

322
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:51,470
workflow changes and before you hand out

323
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,480
something to the public you need to be

324
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,400
good cipher if you're in the

325
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,680
mathematical sense very importantly

326
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,680
secure against sectionals and fault

327
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:05,660
attacks as well and same like inside

328
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,950
channel several fault injection

329
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:14,720
techniques injection so people have

330
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,510
complex setups and they put on tip

331
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,400
underneath the laser and they're able to

332
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,940
shoot at the right spot and zero make a

333
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,920
variety

334
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,990
us the encryption or something in

335
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,920
right now I've reached the final

336
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,769
question of this webinar and this is

337
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:37,660
what we cover in the course in the

338
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:45,959
hardware aisle and briefly remind you

339
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:49,569
standard encryption algorithms like yes

340
00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:53,759
RSA we will need concepts from however

341
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,279
if you are not fully familiar with those

342
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:58,540
algorithms there's no need to implement

343
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,399
them we assume that they're already in

344
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,030
place inside the embedded devices and

345
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,439
however while hacking them it's quite

346
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,449
good remain to remember their basic

347
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:10,359
structure so if you feel like attending

348
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,970
the course to freshen them up in

349
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,280
Wikipedia and we will also be offering

350
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,809
an introductory discussion on how this

351
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:21,369
cipher works in case you need to

352
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:27,150
remember the second thing is come in the

353
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:31,600
standings so first thing first we cover

354
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,030
quite a lot of data analysis so we give

355
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,679
you sides followed measurements

356
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,690
specifically power measurements and

357
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,210
electromagnetic emission measurements

358
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:42,250
and then we will teach you we will not

359
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:51,070
give you not to make it will eat you and

360
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,530
of course we will use this code and

361
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,750
analyze those side channel measurements

362
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,450
in order to extract the crypto key so

363
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:01,150
for every assignment that we do okay

364
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,240
there is some reward in the end like if

365
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,150
you manage to code the attack correctly

366
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,860
then you will be able to get out the

367
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,289
secret key of the device and of course

368
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:13,809
if we aim for this process to be as much

369
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:15,669
as interactive as possible in the sense

370
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:18,370
that we'll be discussing and helping you

371
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:21,330
with coding this data analysis attacks

372
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,860
recover most subtle techniques like

373
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,570
simple power analysis differential for

374
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,539
analysis correlation for analysis and

375
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:33,720
the slightly more sophisticated rely on

376
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,610
some concepts from Statistics quite

377
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:38,620
simple and we will be reminding

378
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,970
throughout the course we will be

379
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,309
teaching the reminding those concepts to

380
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:44,200
everyone all right

381
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,350
there goes data analysis now with

382
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,570
respect to data capturing data

383
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,610
contribute more and let's say a tricky

384
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,680
process but we have several chip

385
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,900
whisperer devices where you can easily

386
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,450
capture data and we will hand over those

387
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:02,250
devices so that you also get a feeling

388
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,920
through this holding loop will be using

389
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:13,000
MATLAB MATLAB or octave or Python with

390
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,390
numpy so if you feel like we always run

391
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,040
a quick tutorial in the beginning when I

392
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,680
remind you how four loops are in those

393
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,930
languages but if you feel like you can

394
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:26,320
definitely take a look at basic coding

395
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,570
techniques with those things so just you

396
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:32,610
get faster in general we don't message

397
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:36,100
this but you can code simple things like

398
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,980
for loops if conditions and use certain

399
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,660
built-in functions that we will be

400
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:48,310
discussing together object sports with

401
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,170
fun injection and the chip was first up

402
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:52,690
once again we will produce some voltage

403
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,790
glitching effects and we will be using

404
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,470
them to recover the security of RSA

405
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,330
using one of the standard effects and

406
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,550
this for this involves some Python

407
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:07,020
coding so yes discussing this indeed

408
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,520
right

409
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,840
the perception our squeeze they're also

410
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,490
available on the website

411
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:22,160
let's little and me we run the you

412
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,960
should've been running this training for

413
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,780
other last years together and if there

414
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,700
are any questions something that isn't

415
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,230
clear to you or something of the like

416
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,850
you know feel free to put custom

417
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:34,660
property mail any of those addresses

418
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,160
well thank you very much for attending

419
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:43,000
and happy to receive any questions
