00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,960
hi everyone good to have you join us

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,960
today for a very different webinar

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,600
than our regular core technical hardware

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,519
security sessions

6
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,920
my name is anthrix and i'm part of the

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,400
hardware dot io team

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,880
at hardware.io we are creating a

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,079
platform where

10
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,200
we brainstorm ideas to defend and attack

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,280
various hardware secure various hardware

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,719
devices

13
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,719
we have been running a conference in the

14
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,680
netherlands and in u.s since 2015

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,520
and it revolves around key concerns

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,680
related to bacto

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,120
firmware embedded attacks and protocol

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,199
security issues

19
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,680
we also have our hands-on live hardware

20
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,199
security trainings coming up in the

21
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,640
month of september

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,160
do check our website for more

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,320
information

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,920
today's webinar is by kai eins

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,520
who's the ceo of of the go-to place

26
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,520
where fixers want to fix any hardware

27
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,000
he's going to talk to us about as we

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,080
secure the internet of things

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,880
we are accidentally locking out fixers

30
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,920
and thinkers

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,040
from the current hardware ecosystem

32
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,280
so let's welcome kyle to deliver his

33
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,280
presentation on building a repairable

34
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,720
future

35
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,119
the format for today's webinar is pretty

36
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:33,920
simple

37
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,640
10 minutes 30 minutes of kyle's

38
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,680
presentation

me uh this is gonna be fun

48
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,320
i'm gonna take you all on a little bit

49
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,320
of a whirlwind tour

50
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,920
of uh uh the world of hardware right to

51
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,560
repair

52
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,640
and uh and what my life is like but but

53
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,840
first i want to give you a little bit of

54
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,080
an introduction to ifixit

55
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,280
ifixit is a uh open source repair

56
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,120
community our goal is to teach everybody

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,200
in the world how to fix their things

58
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,760
with about 10 million people a month on

59
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,879
ifixit

60
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,400
learning how to fix something whether

61
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,160
it's an iphone or

62
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,280
a uh or a you know

63
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,160
kitchen uh say a kettle whatever it is

64
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,000
we have service manuals for all kinds of

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,680
gizmos

66
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,519
and we also do tear downs of the latest

67
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,040
hardware when it comes out

68
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,040
uh and our our high level goal uh is to

69
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,480
enable more repair get more people

70
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,280
fixing things um prevent sort of the

71
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,319
the e-waste tragedy from becoming our

72
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,120
future

73
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,720
um in some places in the world there's a

74
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,200
lot more repair and reuse happening than

75
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,920
elsewhere uh we were just talking about

76
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,400
uh

77
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,680
my adventures in delhi and uh traveling

78
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,360
around india it has been you know very

79
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,800
clear that there is a much stronger

80
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,000
repair culture in india

81
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,920
than there is elsewhere in the world say

82
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,680
where i'm at in california

83
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,920
and i think that that is an area where

84
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,400
uh the indian community and culture is

85
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,360
just is just

86
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,080
uh objectively better than the american

87
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,120
culture and it's something that we need

88
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,000
to learn from

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,239
uh so we are uh trying to bring back

90
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,840
this culture of repair

91
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,599
and to set up these uh repair

92
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,440
technicians as

93
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,599
heroes as people that we can look up to

94
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,720
but of course

95
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,720
uh fixing things in this day and age uh

96
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,879
involves a lot more uh software

97
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,879
than the traditional hardware approach

98
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,480
and so i'm gonna talk about

99
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,400
uh some of the various obstacles that

100
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,319
we're seeing pop up to repair when it

101
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,560
starts involving intellectual property

102
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,879
uh and my background i'm a software

103
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,400
engineer so i can get as technical as

104
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,200
all of you want

105
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,799
and we can dive into the details of what

106
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,799
technological protection measures uh

107
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,120
look like fundamentally i fix its goal

108
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,799
is to is to teach everybody how to fix

109
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:55,760
their things

110
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,439
we can't teach you how to fix something

111
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,680
if uh you need to jailbreak in order to

112
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,120
do the repair and there's no jailbreak

113
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,080
available

114
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,480
so we need practical accessible

115
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,400
approaches to fixing things

116
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,159
uh before we dive into some of the legal

117
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,519
technicalities i'll just give you sort

118
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,000
of a

119
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,640
classic i fix the example uh i think

120
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,080
this product is really only sold in the

121
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,238
us this is a starbucks barista

122
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,000
starbucks has decided to name their

123
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,918
coffee making robots the same thing as

124
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,680
their coffee making humans

125
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,120
i think that's a very cool thing for

126
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,120
them to do but this is a starbucks

127
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,080
barista

128
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,440
and the barista has um

129
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,759
uh i mean i i get if this is the the

130
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,280
sort of tragedy of running a company

131
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,560
called i fixed this everyone gives you

132
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,520
their broken things

133
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,520
so i was given this brief it didn't work

134
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,120
he said do you want and i said sure and

135
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,440
so

136
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,120
i had no idea how to fix the thing i

137
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,199
just took it apart and i posted some

138
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,720
information online

139
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,919
uh and and uh what it turned into you

140
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,520
see that there's an edit button on this

141
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,160
on this step over time people

142
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,840
started improving my instructions i

143
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,960
started getting emails from people

144
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,639
saying hey thanks so much for fixing

145
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,240
for helping me fix my thing so i don't

146
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,919
need to explain the open

147
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,919
way open source works to all of you uh

148
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,360
but that's what we've done is this is an

149
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,880
open source repair community where it's

150
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,000
all a wiki and

151
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,520
and you can learn and get better and

152
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,280
people like hey look the heating element

153
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,280
goes out just just use a multimeter and

154
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,960
measure the resistance across that and

155
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,520
if

156
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,039
if it's burned out then you won't have

157
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,639
any connectivity across the heating

158
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,440
element

159
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,880
makes sense to me um across i fix it you

160
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,160
know people are fixing all kinds of

161
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,560
things

162
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,520
uh we use the experiences that our

163
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,039
community has to give feedback to

164
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,560
manufacturers and to try to make

165
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,280
products more repairable

166
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,120
and at a high level what we're trying to

167
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,199
do is go from this linear economy where

168
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,800
we dig things out of the ground

169
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,720
use them for a little while and toss

170
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,120
them away to something that's more of a

171
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,520
of a circular economy and this is this

172
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,960
is the circular economy

173
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,199
okay so normally i talk about material

174
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,199
flows when we talk about how the metals

175
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,639
you know move from the ground all the

176
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,160
way through to the user and then

177
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,800
you know this this outer loop uh this

178
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,880
other loop here is recycling maybe

179
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,680
refurbishing

180
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,000
repair is where we would like to to sit

181
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,440
let's think about this from a software

182
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,039
lifecycle perspective

183
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,680
um where are the pieces in the in the

184
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,639
stage where

185
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,440
uh a user might need to modify uh uh

186
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,400
software

187
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,319
at what point let's say let's say a

188
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,560
product is happily in the use phase

189
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,440
uh and uh uh you know google buys the

190
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,400
company

191
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,000
and shuts off the servers which is what

192
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,680
happened with the nest revolve

193
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,160
home hub and so you have uh people who

194
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,840
had their home automation system say

195
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,360
their sprinkler system is tied into

196
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,800
their revolve home hub

197
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,400
and all of a sudden the servers get shut

198
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,000
off well what do you do

199
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,800
well it's amusingly the exact same

200
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,800
problem as if you're an everquest

201
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,240
fan i don't know if any of you are old

202
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,000
enough to play everquest but everquest

203
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,680
amazing

204
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,479
mmorpg before the world of warcraft days

205
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,360
and uh they shut the servers off so if

206
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,560
you want to keep playing everquest with

207
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,759
your friends what do you do well you

208
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,360
have to reverse engineer the server

209
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,560
build your own server

210
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,240
crack your client software to talk to

211
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,240
the new server and then you're off to

212
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,280
the races

213
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,000
um and if this seems ludicrous uh to do

214
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,800
for your home hub

215
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,160
i think it's going to be the future i

216
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,440
think that's what we're going to have to

217
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,039
do we're going to have to take ownership

218
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,160
of our devices

219
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,639
and rest control of them away from these

220
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,880
you know cloud-connected one-to-one

221
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,080
uh pairing uh we've seen some uh you

222
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,840
know sonos is deprecating some of their

223
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,280
old hardware and they're saying well we

224
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,720
can just break your hardware for you

225
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,080
like no i don't want you to brick my

226
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,520
smart hardware i just wanted to stop

227
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,560
talking to you

228
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,560
and let me run my plain vanilla linux

229
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,000
system

230
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,319
i think that the biggest success of

231
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,199
product that

232
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,599
uh where the software and the hardware

233
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,440
sort of coexist in a way that extends

234
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,720
life spans dramatically

235
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,120
is with wireless routers all right you

236
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,720
can use and i'll bust out of here we'll

237
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,120
go

238
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,879
edw rt right ddwrt is amazing

239
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,720
it's a you know open source firmware to

240
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,479
run on your wireless rather and it

241
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,319
doesn't matter if you have

242
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,120
a linksys or netgear router that the

243
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,039
manufacturer isn't providing patches for

244
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,280
because the ddwrt community is doing it

245
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,080
already

246
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,520
so the more that we can have a common

247
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,520
baseline of

248
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,680
standardized platforms and then secure

249
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,199
open source software that we can run on

250
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,639
it then that provides owners the

251
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,800
possibility of extending the lifespan

252
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,639
most manufacturers don't want to deal

253
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,560
with a product for more than

254
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,280
a year or two after it comes out i'll

255
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,759
give you another example

256
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,319
samsung has these smart refrigerators

257
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,120
with

258
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,720
with touch screens in them and let's see

259
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,639
we'll just google a little bit here

260
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,000
so uh this is not a ridiculous thing to

261
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,519
be talking about doing and and there are

262
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,200
many reasons why you might do it and

263
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,080
some people are talking about

264
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,599
jailbreaking the tizen

265
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,399
uh is that uh so google changed the api

266
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,080
for their uh calendar integration so

267
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,279
something that you might want on your

268
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:45,760
smart

269
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,519
uh refrigerator is your list of calendar

270
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,279
entries for the day well google changed

271
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,000
the api

272
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,839
samsung never bothered to issue an

273
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,360
update for the refrigerator to talk to

274
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,320
the new api

275
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,080
and so you have these year old

276
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,839
refrigerators that were very expensive

277
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,200
with fancy touch screens and the

278
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,240
calendar doesn't work

279
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,680
and samsung doesn't care because they

280
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,519
just want to sell you a new refrigerator

281
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,279
so in order to get in and make your

282
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,399
calendar work you have to root the uh

283
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,279
uh the operating system and then get in

284
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:11,600
and

285
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,640
and provide your own patch to make your

286
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,720
calendar work and and people absolutely

287
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,160
uh you know have done this successfully

288
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,519
um so this is where

289
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,080
yeah the world of like using products

290
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,200
and tinkering with them

291
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,519
and doing security research and fixing

292
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,399
them

293
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,320
all comes together because it turns out

294
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,000
it's all fundamentally the same thing

295
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,600
it's basically anytime you want to do

296
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,720
something with your device that you

297
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,680
don't have permission from the

298
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,200
manufacturer for

299
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,360
uh now you're in the world of you know

300
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,399
hardware hacking

301
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,200
uh and so this is that there's there's

302
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,160
sort of two

303
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,399
main thrusts to the right to repair

304
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,600
movement

305
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,320
one is saying to the manufacturers hey

306
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,920
you need to provide us with with the

307
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,640
tooling

308
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,480
to be able to repair our products let's

309
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
say that the the refrigerator has a

310
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,200
setting

311
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,680
that controls which calendar api it

312
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,200
talks to but maybe

313
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,519
that wasn't made available in user space

314
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,320
uh there's a

315
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,000
you know system configuration setting

316
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,360
well we ought to have access to the

317
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,040
system configurations for the for the

318
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,160
products that we have

319
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,920
uh right now we're increasingly being

320
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,839
locked out the default is let's make it

321
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,440
as easy to use as possible

322
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,240
and any kind of service or diagnostic

323
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,560
interfaces aren't available to the user

324
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,800
and so there is a wave of right to

325
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,399
repair legislation that's being

326
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,680
introduced around the world there's

327
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,360
conversations in australia

328
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,720
canada 20 different u.s states europe

329
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,480
has said that as part of their circular

330
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,839
economy plans they're going to be

331
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,360
introducing right to repair

332
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,600
laws they passed a very very lightweight

333
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,839
non-software right to repair law for

334
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,200
appliances last year the most recent

335
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,040
race repair law that passed in the world

336
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,720
that has had a really big impact

337
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,880
was the massachusetts automotive rate to

338
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,640
repair bill in 2012

339
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,240
and what that did was said that the

340
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,720
software diagnostics to talk to the car

341
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,640
to get standard error codes had to be

342
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,000
modernized and standardized

343
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,920
across manufacturers and that is what's

344
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,839
led to the modern obd2

345
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,000
port and standard can bus diagnostic

346
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,959
codes that you can pull off for a car

347
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,760
overall the the like standardized repair

348
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,560
situation is

349
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,040
quite a bit better for cars than it is

350
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,640
for other products

351
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,320
and so uh i've been work uh leading an

352
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,839
organization that has been working on

353
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,560
introducing uh legislation is

354
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,519
based on the massachusetts bill across

355
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,000
the u.s

356
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,399
and europe to extend that those

357
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,399
automotive standardization protections

358
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:32,959
around

359
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,480
making sure that we have access to tools

360
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,320
and information to products

361
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,800
other than uh cars and it's basically

362
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,560
everything other than cars so it's farm

363
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,120
equipment

364
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,640
tractors i'll talk about tractors here

365
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,640
in a minute uh it is

366
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,920
medical equipment things like

367
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,519
ventilators which are really important

368
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,399
right now

369
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,000
uh it turns out you can jailbreak

370
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,480
ventilators you can actually jailbreak a

371
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,320
bipap machine and turn it into a

372
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,600
ventilator

373
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,720
which is pretty cool if you take the

374
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,240
firmware off the ventilator and load it

375
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,760
onto the bipap machine it turns it into

376
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,079
a ventilator pretty cool

377
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,040
uh there are uh and and then of course

378
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,720
you know things like smartphones and

379
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,000
and everything else so this is the

380
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,160
original um

381
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,440
right to repair law that was passed in

382
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,920
massachusetts the massachusetts has a

383
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,480
very interesting legislative approach

384
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,880
some places in the u.s do this where

385
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,279
individual voters can vote on a specific

386
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,079
issue

387
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,440
so this is actually 2.3 million people

388
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,920
in massachusetts voted in favor of this

389
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,200
right to repair bill which is pretty

390
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,760
cool

391
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,600
uh and there is another bill that is

392
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,760
coming up it will also be question one

393
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,800
on uh on the ballot uh in a couple

394
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,360
months

395
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,360
um following up on this saying in

396
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,880
addition to the wired

397
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,760
uh repair diagnostics uh it will uh

398
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,240
require that the wireless telematics

399
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,399
also be available and it's not just read

400
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,320
access to the wireless telematics

401
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,480
it's a two-way diagnostic and so we can

402
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,560
talk about how we can secure that is

403
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,160
going to be very very interesting

404
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:56,800
challenge

405
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,040
the ballot initiative says that third

406
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,720
parties must have secure

407
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,240
two-way communication to the car

408
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,920
i know we'll see

409
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,760
um so uh some some things that

410
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,320
that manufacturers have been using um

411
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,519
some ways that they have

412
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,360
have locked down competition this is a

413
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,600
leather that a friend of mine got

414
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,519
tim hicks ran this website very

415
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,279
creatively named tim's laptop repair

416
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,240
manuals

417
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,240
uh and he would post service managers

418
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,000
for all kinds of things toshiba sent him

419
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,839
this legal takedown notice

420
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,000
and so in response we launched operation

421
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,279
fixed toshiba

422
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,160
and had people uh send us laptops or

423
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,920
send us money to buy laptops to replace

424
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,600
all the service manuals that had been

425
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,720
taken offline

426
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,800
we made toshiba a new logo in the

427
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,480
process another pr folks were really

428
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,720
happy with me for that

429
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,040
and um and so overall you know we've

430
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,320
been we've been moving this direction

431
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,720
but the

432
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,079
one of the reasons that repair

433
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,760
information schematics are so important

434
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,720
for right to repair

435
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,399
is the number of product models in the

436
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,160
world this is the number of iphones you

437
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,639
know it's

438
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,480
it's a pie chart this is reasonable

439
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,000
there's uh you know obviously

440
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,279
there's newer iphones since then but

441
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,040
there are not that many iphone models

442
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,920
overall

443
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,800
uh this is the android landscape uh it

444
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,040
is so fragmented that

445
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,440
we are trying very hard at ifixit to

446
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,199
create a open source service manual for

447
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,079
everything

448
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,680
but doing it in isolation without help

449
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,920
from all of these manufacturers is a ny

450
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,120
impossible task and so

451
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,040
you have to have access to detailed

452
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,880
information detailed part supply chain

453
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,639
detailed diagnostic software for every

454
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,199
single one of these products

455
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,040
when we think about consumer psychology

456
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,320
one of the things that

457
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,079
has been a real barrier i think to

458
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,760
people getting in and fixing things

459
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,079
uh i think security researchers you know

460
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,000
we see a warranty voided for movesticker

461
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,720
and we're like ooh

462
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,800
that's the first place i'm going uh but

463
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,240
the rest of the public does not

464
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,360
necessarily

465
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,600
and uh these warranty voided for move

466
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,120
stickers are a real deterrent for people

467
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,480
working on equipment when i

468
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,000
encourage people to fix their broken

469
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,199
thing they'll say well what about the

470
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,000
warranty

471
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,760
and my first question is well if it's

472
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,440
already broken why didn't you take it to

473
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,880
the manufacturer if the warranty was

474
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,920
going to cover it

475
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,560
uh and that's uh huh that's interesting

476
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,440
but the other thing

477
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,199
these these stickers it's just like it's

478
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,639
it's almost you have to have permission

479
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,079
to open these things up

480
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,399
uh so i have news for you these stickers

481
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,079
are completely illegal in the united

482
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,079
states they are unenforceable and we got

483
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,440
the federal trade commission to start

484
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,120
sending letters to companies telling

485
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,880
them to stop putting these stickers and

486
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,839
products

487
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,000
uh and we are uh we are thrilled to say

488
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,480
that sony and nintendo and microsoft

489
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,040
have all stopped doing that and we're

490
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,920
going to continue

491
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,600
on them we've been going after appliance

492
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,519
manufacturers have been doing this so

493
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,360
if you see any warranty void for move

494
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,880
stickers send them to me and i will get

495
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,399
that company an instagram

496
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,600
and make them stop there are other

497
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,800
uh approaches that are frustrating uh

498
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,639
apple has been going after companies for

499
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,320
trademark infringement for importing

500
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,519
service parts

501
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,600
microsoft went after eric lundgren this

502
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,320
is a refurbishing license issue he made

503
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,279
a bunch of

504
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,440
replacement restore disks for dell

505
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,320
laptops

506
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,399
so this was like the windows driver disk

507
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,000
and microsoft sued him and said that

508
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,160
every single restore disk that he

509
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,720
sold that was just clones of of the the

510
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,399
software that didn't have a license key

511
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,519
with them they were just

512
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,839
you know software backup uh restore

513
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,440
disks uh they said that each of those

514
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,399
was worth a

515
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,839
windows license of 150 and he had

516
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,600
imported 10 000 of them and so you can

517
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,199
do the math it was a lot of money

518
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,720
uh meanwhile eric is just this poor

519
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,320
recycler trying to help people fix old

520
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,600
dell laptops

521
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,360
uh and has traveled around the world

522
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,959
talking about the problems with e-waste

523
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,320
eric spent uh 18 months in prison

524
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,839
um as a result of this so thanks

525
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:36,639
microsoft

526
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,000
um here's the and you can see

527
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,279
uh this is if you don't if you don't

528
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,959
read tech dirt they're a fantastic

529
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,079
copyright ip

530
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,839
uh website so there was there was

531
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,880
petitions it was it was a whole thing

532
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,040
um so the last thing i want to mention

533
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,720
is in addition to the right to repair

534
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,560
work that is going on we also have

535
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,600
problems with the dmca this is the us

536
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,880
digital millennium copyright act

537
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,079
and we um in

538
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,839
with the dmca uh uh and i'm gonna pull

539
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,079
up section 1201 and i realize that this

540
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,599
is a global audience and maybe only a

541
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,280
few of you are in the u.s but u.s

542
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,599
copyright law has this nasty tendency of

543
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,959
spreading around the world

544
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,199
we we as a imperialist you know empire

545
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,280
are very proud of our movie studios in

546
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,520
hollywood and so we tend to export our

547
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,720
copyright protections

548
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,720
to every country that we do business

549
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,000
with um

550
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,240
so section 1201 says and i apologize for

551
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,919
going into legalese here but it says

552
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,520
that no person shall circumvent a

553
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,120
technological measure

554
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,520
that controls access to a work protected

555
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,799
under this title

556
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,880
and unfortunately work protected under

557
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,360
this title includes software

558
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,640
software is generally covered under

559
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,039
copyright and and of course all of the

560
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,640
embedded software that runs the hardware

561
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,799
that we we know and love and secure

562
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,080
uh that embedded software is

563
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,200
protected under copyright and so uh

564
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,880
what this says is that you cannot

565
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,720
circumvent a lock a technological

566
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,000
measure you cannot circumvent the lock

567
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,039
that is protecting

568
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,080
access to a a copyrighted work so you

569
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,840
cannot break a lock that is protecting

570
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,280
access to software

571
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,200
so in the word this makes jailbreaks

572
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,320
illegal

573
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,240
it is not legal to jailbreak an iphone

574
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,360
because the the

575
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,679
the software uh that is protecting that

576
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:22,640
the

577
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,240
right that that lock is protecting

578
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,400
access to the software underneath

579
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,640
um the the first example of this this

580
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,320
log really being used was

581
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,880
when there was a motorola razor back in

582
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,600
the motorola

583
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,080
razer flip phone days uh the motorola

584
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,039
razor was

585
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,360
uh there was a uh carrier unlocked so

586
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,960
you can move it from one phone carry to

587
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,080
another

588
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,919
that cena conifer was leveraging and

589
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,840
motorola sued cena

590
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,880
for copyright infringement under section

591
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,600
1201 of the u.s copyright act

592
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,520
okay now there's an escape hatch

593
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,280
jailbreaking is legal now

594
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,039
and the reason jailbreaking is legal is

595
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,360
because lower down in this statute

596
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,160
there is a a section where it says that

597
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,200
you can

598
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,120
uh you can get exemptions um to

599
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,480
you can get exemptions to uh and and the

600
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,160
way these exemptions work is every three

601
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,840
years we apply and so we work really

602
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,280
closely with the electronic frontier

603
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,480
foundation and others

604
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,880
to apply for exemptions to this law

605
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,559
unfortunately

606
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,200
they have determined that every type of

607
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,880
gizmo out there requires a separate

608
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,000
exemption so we had to

609
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
reply for an exemption for jailbreaking

610
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,080
iphones and a separate exemption for

611
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,600
jailbreaking ipads

612
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,880
and a separate exemption for

613
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,640
jailbreaking apple watches

614
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,080
and we're telling them like it is the

615
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,600
same damn software that runs on all of

616
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,720
these why do we have to apply for

617
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,919
different exemptions

618
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,080
but this is the the state of affairs

619
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,080
right now and this is not just the us

620
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,640
issue

621
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,160
mexico right now is considering a

622
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,160
copyright implementing a copyright act

623
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,080
it passed the senate the other day that

624
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,000
is just as bad if not worse as this

625
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,720
law as a software engineer it is

626
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,559
infuriating to me that you can pass a

627
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,320
law that says it is illegal to break a

628
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,520
technological lock

629
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,200
because what that means is that certain

630
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,120
kinds of math are illegal

631
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,520
right the dcss algorithm that removes

632
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,039
the css copy

633
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,280
uh protection scheme from dvds it is

634
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,159
illegal

635
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,200
for me to show you that uh algorithm

636
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,720
it's on wikipedia by the way

637
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,440
but it is illegal uh under this statute

638
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,320
to do

639
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,520
very common uh uh you know

640
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,280
things that we do every day right i mean

641
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,880
it is is commonplace

642
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,120
to bypass technology protection measures

643
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,960
so this is an evil law it needs to be

644
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,760
repealed

645
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,280
uh it needs to be fought in every

646
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,960
jurisdiction in every country

647
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,799
every trade treaty the trans-pacific

648
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,480
partnership uh

649
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,280
that the u.s was working on in on the

650
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,480
pacific uh uh

651
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,559
side of things in the atlantic t-tip the

652
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,640
same one both of those treaties had

653
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,679
uh had this evil law in it we got to do

654
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,360
everything we can to fight back on on

655
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:49,760
that

656
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,679
but both uh for repair but also for

657
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,360
security research

658
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,320
and then on the uh on the right to

659
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,360
repair side of things

660
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,120
there's a real opportunity to pass new

661
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,400
right to repair laws

662
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,559
and and and so what's the interaction

663
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:03,440
between a

664
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,840
retro pair law like massachusetts law

665
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,360
and a fix to the

666
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,080
to the dmca copyright act we've got it's

667
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,240
basically the right to repair says

668
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,240
sell me the tool sell me the the wrench

669
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,760
or the screwdriver or the digital

670
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,039
diagnostic tool to talk to the

671
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,559
refrigerator and fix it

672
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,200
and fix the dmca would say make it legal

673
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,919
for me to whittle my own screwdriver

674
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,240
so we are we are hackers and tankers and

675
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,600
all of you are probably capable of

676
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,200
whittling your own screwdriver

677
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,480
uh but uh the um

678
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,559
uh the masses most people are not and so

679
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,679
it would be nice if if

680
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,320
you could buy the diagnostic tool uh if

681
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,080
and where and when you needed to

682
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,280
so with that i will stop rambling and uh

683
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,080
and turn it over

684
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,000
to you guys for for questions the the

685
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,240
global uh repair movement is is

686
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,799
going strong repair.org is organizing

687
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,159
and leading a lot of it

688
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,360
um in in europe it's repair.eu and of

689
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,039
course i fix it is at the front of the

690
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,360
fight as well

691
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,600
all right that was really short and

692
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,520
quick to summarize

693
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,960
uh how can we build a repairable future

694
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,240
uh kyle we have some questions

695
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,919
uh let me read out the first one to you

696
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,000
what's the difference between jailbreak

697
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,320
and rooting the device

698
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,320
pretty much the same thing right yeah

699
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,480
yeah there are different kinds of so

700
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,000
there's a difference in unlocking

701
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,880
and jailbreaking on phones anything with

702
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,000
a cellular chip

703
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,919
unlocking is bypassing the lock on the

704
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,679
cellular baseband which has its own

705
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:34,720
firmware on it right

706
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,480
where jailbreaking is is basically

707
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,480
rooting the devices getting access

708
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,559
yeah i think jailbreak may be more of an

709
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,799
ios term and everything is more android

710
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,760
yes yeah but it's the same thing all

711
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,400
right

712
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,320
uh there's another question with regards

713
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,760
to repairing that

714
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,159
includes firmware how do you handle

715
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,000
proprietary firmware

716
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,320
manually reverse engineer and create

717
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,720
patches

718
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,520
i mean it's up to whatever community is

719
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,039
working on it and this is a real

720
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,559
challenge this is something i think all

721
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,720
of you could contribute to is if you

722
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,120
identify an abandoned device please you

723
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,120
know develop a replacement let's see if

724
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,400
we can you know

725
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,840
break through whatever usually it's

726
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,000
really trivial lame security

727
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,520
break through that and install something

728
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,760
better and more secure on it

729
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,080
we have to like these manufacturers have

730
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,840
such short attention spans they'll make

731
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,120
a product they'll make an internet

732
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,880
connected toaster or whatever whatever

733
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,520
it is

734
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,200
and they'll sell it for 12 months and

735
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,559
then they've got you know i

736
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,880
toaster 2.0 and they forget about the

737
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,559
first toaster that they sold you're like

738
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,720
but the last toaster i bought lasted 10

739
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,240
years you're saying this new

740
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,480
toaster is only you know around as long

741
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,559
as you're going to provide security

742
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,600
it's crazy these manufacturers are

743
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,679
used to a traditional model where they

744
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,279
tool up and they run their factory and

745
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,559
then when the factory stops making the

746
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,159
thing they forget about they move on to

747
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,039
the next thing

748
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,039
but that's not how you support a product

749
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,880
right microsoft and

750
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,799
linux and these software projects we

751
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,159
understand once you ship something

752
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,600
you're maintaining it and you're putting

753
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,039
security updates out there for a long

754
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,400
time

755
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,919
the the the traditional physical product

756
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,919
manufacturers don't understand that

757
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,080
and so they're doing the world i think a

758
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,200
great disservice

759
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,880
and they're introducing vulnerabilities

760
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,880
in every single home

761
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,120
lg's website says that you should check

762
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,480
for security patches for your

763
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,440
refrigerator

764
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,640
every other month so you can imagine

765
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,159
every single gizmo in your

766
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,919
in your house i like to call the

767
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,440
internet of things the internet of

768
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,120
outdated linux distributions

769
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,600
okay or the internet of depending

770
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,400
on who you

771
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,320
are if you don't follow the twitter feed

772
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,840
internet of it is absolutely

773
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,320
fantastic

774
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,240
all right i have received another

775
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,320
question in a private chat

776
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,720
uh how do small time shop prepares

777
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,520
you know fight against these large oems

778
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,960
yeah uh so you know one fix at a time um

779
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,360
also i'll show you wha we'll we'll push

780
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,120
the envelope of what is legal to do on

781
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:03,600
the call

782
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,360
i'm just going to google for iphone

783
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,720
schematic uh

784
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,039
so if you if you go on the streets of

785
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,960
delhi like if you go to rajput liar some

786
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,320
of these electronics markets you will

787
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:12,880
see

788
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,279
uh people doing board level repairs

789
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,279
they're doing board level repairs with

790
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,679
schematics like this so this is union

791
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:20,720
repair

792
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,919
so that's actually a us phone repair

793
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,279
place but you have to have these

794
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,039
detailed schematics

795
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,960
telling you hey you know this is the

796
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,480
value of this resistor because if you

797
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,919
have a surface mount resistor that you

798
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,120
need to replace

799
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,240
um you can't tell the value of it uh

800
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,840
one because it's broken so you can't

801
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,679
measure it and two it's not printed on

802
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,520
the side of it like resistors used to be

803
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,880
so you either have to have a schematic

804
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,159
you have to have another one that's good

805
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,840
that you can measure the value of the

806
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,400
part

807
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,000
so these these schematics which are

808
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,679
really engineering diagrams are highly

809
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:50,559
essential

810
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,960
and and they are used across the board

811
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,600
for

812
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,679
for repairs of products and that's um

813
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,360
so i would say the repair shops are

814
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,600
fighting back by figuring out how to fix

815
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,600
things and fixing them anyway

816
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,279
and of course every every product that

817
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,960
is fixed is one that the manufacturers

818
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,880
are not selling new

819
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,159
but we need to push back more

820
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,720
systemically we need to legitimize this

821
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,720
activity where this is like borderline

822
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,120
illegal under the copyright act to do

823
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,840
uh but of course it's you know highly

824
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,360
common

825
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,360
so let's legitimize the activities that

826
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,360
are already happening

827
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,158
store.com

828
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,720
follow-up response would be if there is

829
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,720
any legal issue against these small

830
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,520
shops

831
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,679
uh or small-time repair guys they could

832
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:36,880
reach out to eff

833
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,400
right yeah eff absolutely or repair.org

834
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,760
or repair that eu

835
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,400
yeah all right yeah and eff has been

836
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,080
very involved in the in the right to

837
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,679
repair fight

838
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,200
all right if there are any other

839
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,679
questions uh okay there is one

840
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,720
what is the status of another us-based

841
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,159
dnc exemption extension yeah so

842
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,440
i'm gonna um dmca yeah

843
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,360
yeah uh yeah okay so uh the every three

844
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,440
years uh we apply for exemptions so

845
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,039
it has been three years it's time to

846
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,480
apply for exemptions again actually it's

847
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,080
been two years we have about a year to

848
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:12,640
apply

849
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,760
so uh just last week we had the

850
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,480
deadline to submit uh to request uh

851
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,000
renewal of our existing

852
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,880
petitions and so we applied to renew all

853
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,559
of the existing positions

854
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,559
and then coming up september 8th there's

855
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,960
a deadline for new applications so

856
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,000
if you have let's say

857
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,640
let's say that in a natural gas pipeline

858
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,559
there's a telematics interface and maybe

859
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,320
the manufacturer isn't around anymore

860
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,919
and you want to be able to

861
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,159
uh right break encryption so that you

862
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,159
can load new firmware on and have a new

863
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,200
company uh

864
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,000
support it or let's say that you're a

865
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,799
airplane

866
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,159
uh uh maintenance company and

867
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,840
gulfstream won't provide you with the

868
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,600
diagnostic software that you need

869
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,840
uh and so you need to bypass a security

870
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,520
password or something that they have

871
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,120
or let's say you're a hospital and you

872
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,399
need to work on the ventilator but

873
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,840
there's a security password

874
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,600
those are all examples of the kinds of

875
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,200
things that we could apply for

876
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,799
exemptions for

877
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,919
um and i can i can show you on the

878
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:17,039
copyright office's website uh

879
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,039
i'll show you where you apply so it feel

880
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,200
free to just submit an application eff

881
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,720
is working on applications we're working

882
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,000
on applications so this is the

883
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,120
uscopyright.gov 1201.

884
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,399
i don't even think you have to be a us

885
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,240
citizen to apply for a

886
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,440
exemption and so they're gonna um here's

887
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,679
section 12 that's the law that's not

888
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,120
helpful where is the

889
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,159
oh here we go got to click on here and

890
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:40,640
then

891
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,960
and then this is the submission page

892
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,000
yeah and it's not

893
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,080
it's not too burdensome to submit really

894
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,760
uh the main thing is that we have to

895
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,720
prove that there's a

896
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,880
lock so before you can apply for an

897
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,960
exemption you have to say well i want to

898
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,960
be able to jailbreak tractors well

899
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,480
is the tractor locked down in the first

900
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,919
place if you can prove the tractor is

901
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,760
locked that there is a digital lock

902
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,960
and that can be anything that could be a

903
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,480
password it could be a you know right

904
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,520
protection bit

905
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,039
whatever it is um uh all of you i i'm

906
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,240
sure can imagine what sort of

907
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,320
productions but the the law is vague and

908
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:10,880
so

909
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,919
a spectrum of security mechanisms i

910
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,840
think any of them could be considered

911
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,320
a technological protection measure um so

912
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,840
if you want to get involved feel free to

913
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,320
like

914
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,159
pick your hardware of choice and apply

915
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,320
for an exemption for it

916
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,279
all right uh i have one last question

917
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,720
kyle

918
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,279
what is your message to the hardware

919
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,159
community

920
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,159
uh on how they could create more

921
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,840
awareness and be a part of

922
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,520
repair or stuff like this

923
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,880
sure we would love to have you join

924
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,880
repair.org as a member and then you can

925
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,320
join our slack and be involved in the

926
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,240
discussion we need more uh

927
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,200
software security experts uh we also

928
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,039
have a coalition

929
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:56,559
of uh security experts securerepairs.org

930
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,080
and i would encourage you to join that

931
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,440
list there's a lot of very prominent

932
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,960
security researchers there

933
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,559
uh when there are right to repair laws

934
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,880
that get introduced um

935
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,279
i'll give you an example this uh i don't

936
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,799
know if this we have a story going up

937
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,399
when i fix it today i'm going to see if

938
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:10,720
it's

939
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,919
up yeah okay here i'll share my screen

940
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,360
one more time and i'm going to share my

941
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,720
computer sound

942
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,080
uh real fast so in the fight again on

943
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,279
the massachusetts

944
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,200
ballot initiative so this is this law

945
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,840
coming up the car manufacturers paid to

946
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,120
take out this ad now

947
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,799
that this what this bill would say is

948
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,240
that other people have to have

949
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,640
uh you know the other mechanics have to

950
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,840
have access

951
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,760
uh to the wireless data coming off of

952
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,240
your car

953
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,000
if question one passes in massachusetts

954
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
anyone could access the most personal

955
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,240
data stored in your vehicle

956
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,720
the federal trade commission warns your

957
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,000
address could be paired

958
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,399
with your garage codes to give easy

959
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,240
access to your home

960
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,200
domestic violence advocates say a sexual

961
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,039
predator could use the data

962
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,320
to stalk their victims

963
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,320
vote no on one keep your data safe

964
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,240
okay so this is ludicrous uh this is

965
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,799
i mean this is the kind of like a a

966
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:15,760
common sense

967
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,440
uh perspective would be very helpful

968
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,279
here so we need security experts

969
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,000
weighing in

970
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,600
and saying this is crazy uh i mean

971
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,360
i can't even keep track of all the the

972
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,120
falsehoods in that but this actually uh

973
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,960
this argument has been successful at

974
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,080
stopping right to repair

975
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,240
laws in the past where they've said look

976
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,440
you know

977
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,039
anyone can hack your thing if this

978
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,519
passes well you already put a two-way

979
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,120
wireless communication interface in the

980
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,440
car

981
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,279
that the manufacturers have access to so

982
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,039
why is you know

983
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,200
uh my insurance company having access to

984
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,960
the car any different than ford having

985
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,320
access to the car

986
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,720
toyota's dealerships got hacked last

987
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,480
year

988
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,799
this is not once you once you put a

989
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,399
modem in the car you kind of sunk

990
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,000
yourself

991
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,960
so uh i think i think that these cars

992
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,320
ought to have an internet like a

993
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:02,880
physical

994
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,880
off switch inside the car that you have

995
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,799
to flip and then like then there's a

996
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:07,679
light that's

997
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,000
and then you know okay it's transmitting

998
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,600
and then you flip it off and it

999
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,159
disconnects power to the modem

1000
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:15,840
that would be my approach to securing

1001
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,200
this thing

1002
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,120
anyway this is just an example of the ad

1003
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,799
hominem attacks that we see

1004
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,880
from uh from the opposition so we need

1005
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,399
we need experts we need security

1006
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,159
researchers we need software engineers

1007
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:27,679
we need

1008
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,600
academics we need people involved

1009
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,200
countering this sort of

1010
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,799
fear uncertainty and doubt

1011
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:37,039
