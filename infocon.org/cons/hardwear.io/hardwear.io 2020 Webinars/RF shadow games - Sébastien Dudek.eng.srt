[Music]

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,969
so we will talk about era of shadow

3
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:14,870
games here is like a very generic

4
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:18,090
plantation which will introduce you all

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,140
the this the aspect of radio and what we

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,269
can do with software definite video so

7
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:30,179
let's let's go so just you know for to

8
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:32,250
introduce myself Who I am I'm Sebastian

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,829
Dudek I'm the founder of don't-ask

10
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,110
we're doing a lot of research on radio

11
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,660
trainings also hardware and software

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,850
division use tools we interesting about

13
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,600
SDR at a hardware Arif ID Wi-Fi a lot of

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,070
technologies so whatever frequency of

15
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,100
radio frequency has a lot of history it

16
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,370
was like she also created so in variety

17
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,199
it was you sorry you know right you for

18
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,090
rather radio navigation jamming bulky

19
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,780
bulky and so on now we be doing we we

20
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,549
can see it in a lot of aspects like

21
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:07,470
wireless television mobile phone

22
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,900
satellites access control systems for

23
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,369
example now today which is like a lot of

24
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:17,369
numerics thanks to GSP which is the

25
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:22,020
digital signal processing and also we

26
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,240
have to know that in each country the

27
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,790
emission and the reception is regulated

28
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,869
by your country so if you want to to

29
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:34,259
emit our receive signal in each country

30
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:37,020
you you have to have a license for that

31
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,110
you know if you you want to use only the

32
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,720
reception know you can always yoga with

33
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,270
the rod the low but now if the emission

34
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,180
is something else so if you viewer tends

35
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,320
to we meet I'll just know be aware that

36
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,140
it's not allowed in your country also

37
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,590
radio of characteristics in review we

38
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,619
have to be aware of many characters

39
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:02,969
characteristic sorry as the the

40
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:05,520
wavelength the celebrity of the other

41
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,190
radio wave the period the frequency

42
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,919
which will also determine which which

43
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,010
also device I will use

44
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,890
which antenna I will use how far we will

45
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,700
go my icing now so this is a lot of

46
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,739
aspects you to techy backgrounds are

47
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:26,150
working with radio also to process the

48
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,239
signal we have to represent it in time

49
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:31,519
domain so we have two main step to do

50
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,370
it's the first do something which was

51
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,049
for all the continued singer to

52
00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:38,000
discrete-time signal and the

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,099
consideration which yelled the value

54
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:42,560
discrete the binary number Daenerys like

55
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,170
you know 22 bit floaty number and then

56
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,510
also when doing the sampling there is

57
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,030
something important to you to be aware

58
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,060
of at the beginning it's the Nyquist and

59
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,940
Shannon theory because if you've done

60
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,959
don't sample enough you are like for

61
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,299
example just you know you you're sorry

62
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:17,239
up I'm trying to it's oh sorry I was

63
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:24,139
like just trying to use that's so error

64
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:27,019
in that example it's an example when the

65
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:28,579
sampling do something

66
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:30,579
there's new questions something for

67
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:33,470
frequency is respected so we can see

68
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,199
that the signal is processed very well

69
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:39,049
but in another example we can see that

70
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:41,480
we have some Allison aliasing here

71
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,000
because the Shannon frequency is not

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,940
respected and so this is the main things

73
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,459
to know when we attend to processor

74
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:52,160
signal at the beginning while using a

75
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,449
radio also there's a lot of tools in

76
00:03:56,449 --> 00:04:00,109
radio we we are we need to use like the

77
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:02,120
DFT which is the discrete Fourier

78
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,639
transform which allows you allows us to

79
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:08,769
to know the the composition of the

80
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:12,819
signal and also see at which frequency

81
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:16,880
we we can we can have the signal and how

82
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,738
what are the Al monix that are

83
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:22,750
interesting to use TD here

84
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,480
and also in radio you know why we we

85
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,010
should be interesting in radio because

86
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,890
there is a lot of targets the targets

87
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,780
are the following like the access radio

88
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,200
access controls the mobile phones

89
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,060
navigation systems autonomous car in the

90
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,300
short system so radio can be very

91
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,720
interesting to study because of that

92
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,510
because like for each system there is

93
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,180
like we can find a lot of numerology

94
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,570
relatives too if drooping replace our

95
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,390
injection relays jiaming dose and so on

96
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,580
so there's a lot of university to to so

97
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,880
to find in this system and now we know

98
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,810
that a lot of system use radio with the

99
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,980
radio system to communicates so this is

100
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,900
a very interesting things to know as an

101
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,000
attacker because if you are if we all

102
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,150
out you choose sniffer signal a week we

103
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,800
are able maybe two if drop senior

104
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,100
replace it or also inject some traffic

105
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,210
to control a target so this is why it's

106
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:31,040
very interesting you know also as a tool

107
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,990
before we it was like very complicated

108
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,910
to interact with a signal but now with

109
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,000
the the yes dear the software definite

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,580
radio we are about you to do all the

111
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,810
work with just a little device which can

112
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,960
be generic or specific to to to some

113
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,540
frequencies and does audio digital to

114
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,160
analog and also the analog to digital

115
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,760
conversions every from liquification

116
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,800
mixing and a lot of stuff and the rest

117
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,350
is done in the software part that means

118
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,540
that you do all the modulation on the

119
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,580
motivation and so on so you can studio a

120
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,360
signal at a very low level and there is

121
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,470
a lot of devices available in the market

122
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:19,380
here are just known exists exhaustive

123
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:24,810
list here where you can find some some

124
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,210
you know some reserve that can do a lot

125
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,940
of stuff like this do the USRP but also

126
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,280
cheaper ones like the ref but there are

127
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,139
f2 also here and there's also the SD

128
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:40,530
just also a little bit cheaper and if

129
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,349
you want to do some minimization with

130
00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:46,710
you if you want to do some very

131
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,379
minimalistic device you can also use the

132
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:52,199
exterior X which is also a very very

133
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,520
generic that's also to be a being Geryon

134
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,669
generic other cost it has a cost with

135
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,259
the price but also a cost with

136
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,659
performance and some some generic

137
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:05,610
purpose devices are not sensible enough

138
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:11,129
to to be able to capture signals at some

139
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:13,710
some frequencies so this is you know

140
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:16,289
something that can you know can happen

141
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:20,870
also if you want you to choose a device

142
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,599
also just you know don't look just on

143
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:26,849
the supercut supported frequency which

144
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:28,680
is interesting at the beginning but also

145
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,589
if you are allowed to to do the full

146
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:35,939
deep lexing and also look at so the this

147
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:37,860
sampling because as I said before

148
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,000
sampling frequency is very important to

149
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,580
take in accounts while doing processing

150
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,550
the signal so this is an other stuff to

151
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,009
do to see also this clock stability and

152
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:53,039
then the other stuff like the price the

153
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,610
the the antennas present and also

154
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,360
something interesting or form

155
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,949
forwarding all the samples to your

156
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:05,099
computer and backward it's so important

157
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:07,289
you to choose the right abuse interface

158
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:10,050
because if you use for example USB the

159
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,389
tubers like you know very slow to to

160
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:18,509
forward all the traffic to the device

161
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:21,240
and also to up to all the traffic so you

162
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,930
know look at all these specifics before

163
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,960
choosing your one device then you have

164
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,689
to choose an antenna as I said we have

165
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:32,940
to take in account characteristic of how

166
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,448
radio wave but also as many a

167
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:38,549
characteristic you can find with antenna

168
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:40,849
they are usage frequency the

169
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:43,169
polarization the directivity the

170
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:46,399
dimension in shape world and so on so

171
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,839
everything can you know each

172
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:51,060
characteristic can have an impact

173
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,870
of you in your capture or well when you

174
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:58,290
want to interact with a signal when you

175
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,810
want you train to do some observation in

176
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,630
the air are they are they are like very

177
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:06,090
very good spectrum analyzer like this

178
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,010
one which caused a lot of a lot of money

179
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,260
but when you you don't have a lot of

180
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,830
money I prefer to use for example a

181
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,590
cheaper cheaper device like the air

182
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,600
effects power which is like a gadget but

183
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,050
very useful and also we are also

184
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,240
practical because you can transport it

185
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,300
everywhere you can just show the kids in

186
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,150
your pocket and you can so do some

187
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:33,570
observation but I know yes I know it's

188
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,570
you know it's sort of jig gadget but so

189
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,930
very very useful sometimes then also you

190
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,510
can so to do you observation using

191
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:47,430
easier with G critics and also offer a

192
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:50,760
software like H as their as their job

193
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,540
and so on it's also other tools in

194
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,270
Windows for example here first which is

195
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:00,350
their their chopped off so for Windows

196
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:04,080
here is also a very very good spectrum

197
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,820
analyzer because it allows you to detect

198
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,620
some pics if you are interesting if you

199
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,260
don't know where to look and you just

200
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,850
want you to find some interesting

201
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,520
frequency you can always use this dist

202
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,150
analyzer to find some interesting pigs

203
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,770
there is also the sick digger which is

204
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,800
used for reverse engineering but also

205
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,650
for reverse engineering you will see

206
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:29,460
another tool which is very practical and

207
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:33,450
in which I use every time when I deal

208
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:37,530
with very simple modulations ordinary I

209
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:40,140
use like a new radio but there is no

210
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,660
this not only neural do you have also

211
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,700
photos days do you're also red oak as

212
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,190
the rare but new radio is like no the

213
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:52,890
most use a software so software this

214
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,530
near review software to control the

215
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,720
devices and also you can you know

216
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,240
control if you python in or see most

217
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,430
boosts in pythons you could you can

218
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,810
create signal and fro graph

219
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,390
and also we can do it's also in the in

220
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,940
suppose blues it has a schedule which

221
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,160
allows you to start stop and wait for

222
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,760
operation so this is no this is a little

223
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,890
schema in the rights and how it is

224
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:20,950
composed then if you want to create a

225
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,010
flow graph you can use you can do it but

226
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:26,080
by the end that I don't recommend it so

227
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,840
mainly I use the new radio companion

228
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,090
which is very practical to build all the

229
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,860
blocks and create you FRA graph and

230
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,440
process your signal at the beginning you

231
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,460
start with a source block then you use a

232
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,850
sink with a 52 to know to determine

233
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,770
which frequency is interesting

234
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,660
interesting interesting for you sorry

235
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:50,350
and then now you can you can do all the

236
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,520
stuff by you know accusing some

237
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,090
informations after doing some process

238
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,590
when analyzing the signal you have to

239
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,360
determine the frequency so you have to

240
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,280
look at the shape also to do see the

241
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,250
motivation and sometimes if you deal

242
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,310
with very simple modulation you can

243
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,260
perfectly see that you are dealing with

244
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:16,090
a s key or a whiskey and other than

245
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:18,070
other modulations sometimes the shapes

246
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,750
is complicated so you have to go deeper

247
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,940
by looking at the transmitter specs so

248
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:25,000
sometimes you have to see the the the

249
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,930
chip specs and also using the specs try

250
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,480
to demodulate it they modulate the

251
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:31,930
signal

252
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,780
sometimes the chips also use different

253
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,090
types of motivation so you can you don't

254
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,010
know yet which color modulation is used

255
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,990
so sometimes you also do some brute

256
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,870
forcing you can also then use the blocks

257
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,940
to you need to process all the signals

258
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,910
and then at the end you have to decorate

259
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:52,960
with so the signal genera also protects

260
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,260
it's little bit protected just to check

261
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:00,820
if there is no error on the on the on

262
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,300
the codes and so on so you will use like

263
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,860
assuming / one like which is under that

264
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,380
but then Manchester and so on so these

265
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,800
law a lot of also of work to do on

266
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,350
decoding and also on interpreting the

267
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,060
signal because of also the application

268
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,030
layer to decode

269
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,430
then like said before alternate targets

270
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:24,240
use a RF communication attacking them is

271
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,750
very interesting because no all the

272
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,700
audio signal are broadcasted in the air

273
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,980
so all you have to do is listen by two

274
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,230
to find something interesting try to

275
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,650
deny modulated take out it and then see

276
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,020
if there's some leaks or something you

277
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:43,530
can do if there is no for example

278
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,290
application layer encryption of any

279
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,450
other things that you can play with or

280
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,820
you can for example replay the signal to

281
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,280
see what happened if the if the targets

282
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,010
will try to communicate with you or or

283
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:59,450
repeat same packets so there's a lot of

284
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:04,770
of place to do and then yeah I was like

285
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:07,470
I was like not motioning the tools but

286
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,680
so about reverse engineering this is a

287
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,380
very useful tool if you want to deal

288
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,860
with simple modulations like s key FS

289
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,160
key for example and this is particularly

290
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,180
in for a very simple modulation

291
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,370
particular you just what you have to do

292
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:29,310
it sometimes you auto detect all the

293
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:33,210
parameters and while while while opening

294
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,760
a file I capture file and then you will

295
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,500
have all the information decode it's

296
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,090
sometimes you have also to do some

297
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:42,300
manual configurations but that depends

298
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,860
generally it's automatic you know

299
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,930
January but sometimes you have to also

300
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:48,120
to do some so many other things and then

301
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,910
you you are about to decode simple

302
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,980
modulation is Kiev s key so this is a

303
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,230
very practical cool well but also these

304
00:14:55,230 --> 00:15:00,630
like very good parts in this it's the

305
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,850
analysis which is not in the slide but

306
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:06,230
the analysis part allows you to also to

307
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:10,620
to assist you while decoding some or

308
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,170
some packet so you can also do all the

309
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,510
reverse engineering after the

310
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,740
demodulation

311
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:21,100
she's quite good example of target so

312
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,890
here we will see some targets so we have

313
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,560
played with an Assyrian so what we can

314
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,250
do with those targets you have like

315
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,800
firstly we have very simple devices very

316
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,520
simple

317
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,430
that depends of the of the other devices

318
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,950
but so generally in industry all

319
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,660
scientific and medical frequency bands

320
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,880
you can have like poem materials dual

321
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,740
birth alarms two remotes and a lot of

322
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:48,070
stuff that's you know sometimes a lot of

323
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:51,459
times then do not implement a lot of a

324
00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:53,790
lot of features to protect the signal

325
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,410
sometimes you have also running codes so

326
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:58,420
that depends but generally you can

327
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:03,430
easily decode all those signals and this

328
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,529
is the kind of subjugates

329
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:07,209
device you can find like you know

330
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:11,800
remotes for error rules parameters you

331
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,959
know this is like you know a very old

332
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:17,399
technology that is commonly used but

333
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:20,740
slowly is is replacing by a by other

334
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,430
technologists generally a new a new

335
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,620
targets you can find some some

336
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,450
protections like roaring codes and other

337
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:31,180
things which which are used to protect

338
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:35,470
the the messages from you know from if

339
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,550
dropping or replaying attacks but that

340
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:42,910
depends also on the on the price of the

341
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:46,540
device which frequency you can find in

342
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,790
the those bonds so if you can find those

343
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:53,320
frequencies now may be aware of those

344
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,540
frequency that are commonly used but is

345
00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:01,029
plenty others that also find in this in

346
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:06,040
this category also in more using the own

347
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,069
mobile network if you if you want to

348
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,020
play mobile network targets you have

349
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,089
like a lot of targets like intercoms

350
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:14,410
delivery pickup stations

351
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:17,790
electric electric counters counters

352
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:21,609
cameras alarms cars so there is a plenty

353
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:26,919
of them as you know let's let's see the

354
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:29,919
intercom that's used today because now

355
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,390
interrupts

356
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:35,320
not wired they use remote the remote

357
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,430
communication like gsm 3g 4g or Wi-Fi so

358
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:42,130
we can do a lot of stuff like for

359
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,650
example for intercoms that are connected

360
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,620
to the the mobile network as your we can

361
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,610
for example try to catch the the the

362
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:55,150
intercom using the handler behavior and

363
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:59,290
then try to try to impersonate a

364
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:01,330
resident phone to open the door and so

365
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,570
on so these like a lot of play to do if

366
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,280
you want to detect those kind of

367
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,560
intercom you can detect it by some

368
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,620
modules that are exposed externally like

369
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,950
that and why intercepting the resident

370
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:17,470
phone we can for example while you are

371
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,330
trapping the the intercom to your

372
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,520
network you are able for example to see

373
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,600
it's interesting call it number that is

374
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,520
used by in the intercom to call the

375
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,580
residents and by impersonating

376
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,290
impersonating this number you are you

377
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,870
can you you are about to open the door

378
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:38,500
of the of the front door and go to the

379
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,600
residency so this is the kind of thing

380
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,840
that you can do with the mobile network

381
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,530
devices including all the devices like

382
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:51,640
also I mean say also you have alarms and

383
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,350
so on if you want for example to

384
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,240
impersonate a new number or what you can

385
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,240
use by example with liberties it's true

386
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,240
to do this configure configuration which

387
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,900
allows you to but the the written form

388
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,260
and associate it to you IMSI and then

389
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:12,820
you weaving in tag with intercom urges

390
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:17,260
to register to you to you to you network

391
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,500
and also you attacker phone registered

392
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,570
to the network you are able to

393
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:25,810
impersonate the number and then open the

394
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:29,890
door after after after pushing the

395
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:34,210
button that's is supposed to call the

396
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,940
residence to open the door you can also

397
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:40,600
open with by sending the SMSs and also

398
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:45,220
other messages over SMS so our alum

399
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:45,620
station

400
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,990
how it can be how it can be like very

401
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:52,700
different yeah I was like our stations

402
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,910
not this not this light is not good I

403
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,620
was like sure I wanted to talk about

404
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:00,500
also 3G and 4G targets 3G and 4G 4G

405
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,160
targets pretty the same but it's used 3G

406
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,870
and 4G but that means that you have to

407
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,600
do mutual notification attacks and that

408
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,690
is not it's very complex and not

409
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:14,240
possible so what you have to do with

410
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,690
many to break the modification by Dan

411
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,820
graddic the signal and then you are

412
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,640
about to trap the intercom which you use

413
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,490
3G what is in person important also to

414
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:29,540
know here is is that preaching in Forge

415
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,300
intercom but also I think for 5g and

416
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,179
others will be able I bought you

417
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:37,910
communicated communicate with intercom

418
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:40,190
sunrise server which means that also

419
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,130
this server is used to configure AIT's

420
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:46,700
the intercoms remotely so the intercom

421
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,040
are always like pulling the

422
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,740
configuration from the server and it's

423
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,800
also supposed to be a managed by an

424
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,020
administrator which can be the residence

425
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:02,059
but also some specific administrator and

426
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:05,210
that the disk this this centralized

427
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:09,350
server can be managed via yeah the web

428
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:13,490
all over daenerys like you know a simple

429
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,679
web interface that that allows you to

430
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,960
manage all the inter comes here you can

431
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,140
manage and that you can for example in

432
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:24,770
that specific scenario you don't need to

433
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:27,650
any SD device to do that so you can find

434
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,570
maybe a vulnerability on the web server

435
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:32,740
and target other the resident of the

436
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,970
intercoms that are connected to the

437
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:38,809
server for yeah what is set for 3g and

438
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:42,050
4g targets is like a used me to

439
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,820
ratification so it's difficult to spawn

440
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,250
a station at this level so it's

441
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,820
difficult to you to trap and come which

442
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,860
use region for you so your to doing

443
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,140
great it's using the GSM communication

444
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,770
how to do great it it's not a simple

445
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,450
things but so you can

446
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,850
use some jamming attack I like for

447
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:04,279
example bring your Chinese device to do

448
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:07,519
that very cheap or other devices which

449
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:09,409
are a little bit heavier and difficult

450
00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:14,090
to to bring with you and less mobile but

451
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:17,269
you can also perform that in SDR I know

452
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,010
that scene has the room it's complicated

453
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:21,620
because edge devices cannot Jam all the

454
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,169
the signal in the same time but so you

455
00:22:24,169 --> 00:22:27,470
can also proceed with some small jamming

456
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:30,169
attack which means that for example I've

457
00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:34,519
created a tool which aims to map all the

458
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,549
these cells interesting cells and then

459
00:22:37,549 --> 00:22:41,210
use those cells that I target to jam

460
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,850
them so I just you know focus on

461
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:46,700
specific frequency to jump so this is

462
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,190
like no we this is what I called smile

463
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:52,639
jamming it's like well jamming just you

464
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:55,039
know at the time each frequency that's

465
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,710
are used by an operator for example so

466
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,179
you have also to target specific

467
00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:01,190
operators and with one device or two

468
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,320
device you can jump pretty easily

469
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,830
without having to bring a very very

470
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:10,669
heavy jammer with you intercept cows is

471
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:12,950
very interesting because if you know if

472
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:15,799
you don't know yet you have a v8 system

473
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:20,480
which allows cows to to do all the

474
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,059
infotainment all the stuff like you know

475
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:25,460
you can also play with applications you

476
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,620
can you have also Facebook Twitter on

477
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,950
that and we're intercepting this

478
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,269
communication you can find interesting

479
00:23:32,269 --> 00:23:34,809
things because we can see all the

480
00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:38,809
application that are at a communicate

481
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:41,570
with servers some servers that you can

482
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,399
intercept and then you can see some

483
00:23:43,399 --> 00:23:46,730
interesting IP calls for example when

484
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:50,269
the the IBA of the car wants to upgrade

485
00:23:50,269 --> 00:23:55,760
his humor and all you see here is that

486
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,370
he's used also HTTP and not not

487
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:01,610
encrypted layer so yeah that can be very

488
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:03,919
interesting interesting if the the

489
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,230
application layer is not encrypted as

490
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:11,659
well also what is interesting that in in

491
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:12,970
this industry

492
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,650
you can find a lot of interesting things

493
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:18,010
like all the injuries because no those

494
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:22,240
devices are not old but it's like you

495
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,830
know example it's not that those devices

496
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:29,559
are all but the D concepts is has been

497
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:33,490
for thinkit's before and is maybe you

498
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,260
can find this system from ten years ago

499
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:39,909
that are still in the market and which

500
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:42,610
is interesting that for that is that for

501
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:46,000
very very new cars you can you can find

502
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,020
some old Android and by by just finding

503
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,030
this kind of Android you can you can

504
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:54,789
just think about how much severe you can

505
00:24:54,789 --> 00:24:58,240
use against his own rate for example we

506
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,980
we know that's a decent rate is doing

507
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,110
some requests to web request so we can

508
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:05,950
fight we've had Java Chris JavaScript

509
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:09,280
interface interface a severe air so you

510
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,220
to get our ego remote code execution on

511
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:16,750
that and then attack the the a be a part

512
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:21,539
of the car you can also attack for

513
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:24,820
mobile network by using the the software

514
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,620
drug which is called DSL service LTE

515
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:32,530
which has a serious UE which is like you

516
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,330
know a software emulated user equipment

517
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:38,710
and now allows you to go with very low

518
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:41,890
level and try to find some some bugs in

519
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:46,270
in the mall by operator apart but it's

520
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:48,940
like very complicated because in these

521
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:52,120
parts you even maybe if you if you about

522
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:56,140
you to crash a cell or I don't know you

523
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,159
are not able to debug what is happening

524
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:04,150
in the cell path so this is like no but

525
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:06,429
this part is interesting if you are able

526
00:26:06,429 --> 00:26:09,460
to debug the the cell you are fudging

527
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,909
but in a lot of case it allows you to

528
00:26:12,909 --> 00:26:15,610
see what happens in a low level but in

529
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:20,320
the baguette but not more about my

530
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:20,950
grades

531
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:24,159
it's smart with many about the issue in

532
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,830
the past about power voltage if

533
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,169
we look at the history it's also an

534
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:33,010
interesting thing because I choose an

535
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:35,919
interesting nice drink and interesting

536
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,649
our aspect of the power communication

537
00:26:40,649 --> 00:26:45,190
and yes it's it aims to manage all the

538
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:47,370
the small-scale energy production nodes

539
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:50,950
and it includes a lot of targets you can

540
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:54,130
see in the white like smart meter smart

541
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:57,429
appliance real energy resources and so

542
00:26:57,429 --> 00:27:00,100
on Allah also cows

543
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,950
if you want to Deckard so this signal is

544
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,899
not as easy because there's a lot of

545
00:27:04,899 --> 00:27:06,870
process to do about the OFDM

546
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:11,769
demodulation about that what many views

547
00:27:11,769 --> 00:27:15,250
is a specific device that is about to to

548
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:18,940
be plugged and for that if you are if

549
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:22,179
you interested you can see the the proof

550
00:27:22,179 --> 00:27:25,630
of concepts on v2g injector which is a

551
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:30,909
tool that is made to to to penetrate a

552
00:27:30,909 --> 00:27:33,039
network that is established between a

553
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,269
cow and a charging station remotely even

554
00:27:36,269 --> 00:27:40,450
even if you you can you can even use it

555
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,610
in a residency that is connected to the

556
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:44,409
same electric electric power network as

557
00:27:44,409 --> 00:27:46,899
a smart charging station and you can use

558
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:49,659
that taught to do that but if you want

559
00:27:49,659 --> 00:27:52,630
to go deeper in radio energy you see

560
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:55,720
that in the power line communications

561
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,779
the signal is superpose the data signal

562
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:02,139
is superposed to do to the power pole

563
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:07,710
line a power line to the power sorry so

564
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:10,120
this signal you can find any in many

565
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:14,320
frequency between 1 2 8 and 30 megahertz

566
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,380
and this is the kind of things you can

567
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:20,649
see what we've done

568
00:28:20,649 --> 00:28:23,409
I have like an intern before when I was

569
00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:26,549
working for sylheti who made a small

570
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:29,919
modification on the the plc and this is

571
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,460
a unplugged PLC that was made that was

572
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:37,029
modificated in a way to plug an antenna

573
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:39,039
and that way we were able for example

574
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,169
true

575
00:28:40,169 --> 00:28:43,259
an oscilloscope today that you you see

576
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:49,159
that some some tiny palumbo of home plug

577
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:53,179
home plug line communication devices

578
00:28:53,179 --> 00:28:55,499
could be seen like that

579
00:28:55,499 --> 00:28:58,859
so we then try to process it using the

580
00:28:58,859 --> 00:29:01,529
same implementation as the wine project

581
00:29:01,529 --> 00:29:05,100
which is called the you see which is the

582
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,279
Wi-Fi there we new radio implementation

583
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:11,519
of the Wi-Fi sorry which allows you to

584
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:13,499
do all the demodulation for Wi-Fi that

585
00:29:13,499 --> 00:29:15,690
this implementation you can also use

586
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:19,679
against Chelsea but trying to do that

587
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,859
with an old us a PVR we didn't had a lot

588
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:26,129
of success so we try to also reverse

589
00:29:26,129 --> 00:29:28,529
engineer the Defamer to understand it

590
00:29:28,529 --> 00:29:30,720
and also you see that there is in an

591
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,200
interesting thing which are the SPI of

592
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,299
the other of the power line

593
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:39,409
communication that allows you allows us

594
00:29:39,409 --> 00:29:45,330
we inject some some code on the in the

595
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:49,080
ROM and then we can for example you do

596
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,889
some introspection but in radio some

597
00:29:52,889 --> 00:29:55,080
researcher also makes some very good

598
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:59,609
work on that by using a blade Arif for

599
00:29:59,609 --> 00:30:03,539
example and in v2g they were above

600
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:07,559
example to to sniff the home plug

601
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:09,929
Greenfield frames that are slower than

602
00:30:09,929 --> 00:30:11,029
complicacy

603
00:30:11,029 --> 00:30:16,139
in residences but but it was like a very

604
00:30:16,139 --> 00:30:18,359
good research because it it proved that

605
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:21,539
remotely in the air we can we are about

606
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:26,609
to to to do with dropping remotely and

607
00:30:26,609 --> 00:30:28,980
they also publish a tool to do all the

608
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,009
demodulation and also to process the

609
00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:35,249
signal in a way to get a were shocked

610
00:30:35,249 --> 00:30:38,609
capture recap capture about error

611
00:30:38,609 --> 00:30:40,679
fighting if you we want to go very

612
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:45,299
deeper and in a low level it's like we

613
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:48,809
have to deal with with very very

614
00:30:48,809 --> 00:30:51,659
specific devices but no but when you

615
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:53,550
don't have specific devices

616
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,820
that's our Allah that allows you to to

617
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,150
capture those frequency on between

618
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:03,540
hundreds 25 kilowatts and 13 megahertz

619
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:06,090
so you have to use an up cover to do

620
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:08,880
that and that way we are able to snip

621
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,620
those frequencies using the heterodyne

622
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:16,080
and then you know we can simply D

623
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,040
modulate the signal which is a ski in

624
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:23,820
example so we can always go deeper we

625
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:27,260
first year we can study every signal and

626
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:33,180
also including air Friday but if we want

627
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:36,060
yeah it's like you know I didn't choose

628
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,430
the direct Peter for that but if you if

629
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,820
you want to study the rare Friday I also

630
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:44,100
suggest you to look at the proxmark

631
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:48,060
which is like a very generic tool it

632
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,340
allows you to also to study other air

633
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:54,240
Friday aspects on 'life HF and tags and

634
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,270
winners I tell her it implements a lot

635
00:31:57,270 --> 00:32:00,480
of technology also to decode demodulates

636
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,300
and to do all of the work also it has

637
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:06,210
like a lot of tools like automatic

638
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:08,310
search for technology and also auto

639
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:10,650
pound features to automatically find

640
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:13,200
Keynes fine keys for example in Mifare

641
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,950
classic bags so tella it has a lot of

642
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:19,260
features there is like there is like a

643
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,320
lot of others technology like Laura

644
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,140
bluetooth ZigBee so as I said as there

645
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,850
is like a way to do everything you want

646
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:32,940
we have just you to you have the the

647
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,700
main prevents that it takes time to get

648
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,490
into it but once you are you know once

649
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:42,150
you are like more use of it

650
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:44,190
you all are you allowed to do everything

651
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:47,550
you want so I suggest you two to work on

652
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:51,440
it it's a very for me it's very very

653
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,370
interesting and a very interesting

654
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:56,100
subject so if you have any question

655
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,700
please ask and I have I have finished

656
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:03,160
for these little presentations

657
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,520
and I hope that's I was like clear

658
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,160
enough about all the aspects but is this

659
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,560
pickle also too to explain all of that

660
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:15,250
so in a small small in a short period of

661
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:17,940
time but so if you have any question I'm

662
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:22,000
pretty easy available so if you have a

663
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,380
question please ask and thank you very

664
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:27,040
much thank you Sebastian

665
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,850
I think we already have questions coming

666
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:34,450
up in the chat so if we can go to the

667
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:38,200
chat you will see a lot of questions

668
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,920
coming up

669
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,750
that's weird because I don't see maybe I

670
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:00,440
have to split off stop the sharing maybe

671
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,710
better like that so if you open the chat

672
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,620
window yeah there will be few questions

673
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:13,469
in that it's your things so no hi it's

674
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,790
about saying thank you very much fold

675
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:15,540
okay

676
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,449
may I ask what kind of sitting hardware

677
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:20,760
and software you will recommend for

678
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,470
exploring gsm word please

679
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:28,560
so yeah Bob if you want to study the GSM

680
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,649
parts precisely you don't need you don't

681
00:34:31,649 --> 00:34:36,418
need exactly the USRP stuff but you can

682
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:40,139
already use the blade RF which is quite

683
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:44,570
cheaper than the other than us RP and

684
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:48,360
that will allow you to work work on that

685
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:53,699
but just be aware because maybe the

686
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:57,450
better of 2.0 is not reported that she

687
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:59,850
had bit yes but I'm not sure right now

688
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:02,070
because I have only the diversion one

689
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:04,470
but yeah if you want to do that I work

690
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,940
among you

691
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:10,110
using the yet bit years because a bit

692
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:13,440
years with letter F is is very good to

693
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:21,560
study all the GS m aspect any resource

694
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,300
yeah there is like you know I think that

695
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,610
all the resource can be found in you

696
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:29,070
know a lot of websites I think that's

697
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,850
there's a lot of tutorials I also try to

698
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:36,900
to get sometimes to do some resources in

699
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:42,120
my blog but is yeah there's there is

700
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,760
like you know some some websites like

701
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,940
cig wiki that you can use for example to

702
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:52,620
get some resource on a lot of signals

703
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,840
because because it's like your library

704
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,140
with a lot of samples you can find in

705
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:01,230
the air so if I recommend you to if you

706
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:04,440
not sure about a specific signal in a

707
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,300
specific frequency you can always look

708
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:06,960
at

709
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,130
see wiki website but also captures in

710
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:15,180
github and other tutorials but yeah it's

711
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:18,660
difficult to to recommend one precise

712
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:22,050
resource is like also a great cause cut

713
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:25,650
gadget which has a lot of resources to a

714
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,200
lot of introduction about Reggie of

715
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,380
stuff there's also my training which is

716
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:34,800
like intense in four days where I I go

717
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,990
through all the aspects of radio but so

718
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:40,740
many also in the office in offensive

719
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:44,130
parts which aims to to explore the

720
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:45,869
targets we are targets and how to

721
00:36:45,869 --> 00:36:48,180
interact with them and how to attack

722
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:52,589
them so so yeah there is also my my

723
00:36:52,589 --> 00:36:56,490
training that I promotes sorry but you

724
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:58,410
can find pretty much a lot of resources

725
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:00,270
everywhere but so if you not sure about

726
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:02,160
so one signal what's missus fix you know

727
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,770
maybe try to you look at sig vici for

728
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:08,720
example or get terrible I don't know I

729
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:15,630
to make sure which will relay attack

730
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:19,530
here really attack attack stats when for

731
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:22,680
example you want you you have you are

732
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,630
like in my demon in the middle position

733
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:27,030
for example you have two targets and

734
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:32,010
what you are able to do is to with the

735
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:34,770
attack for example to change to do some

736
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:36,599
bit flipped or change some specific

737
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:39,990
aspect on the corrugation of the the

738
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:42,390
packets that are ascended or example we

739
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:44,670
can try to just you know to swap a

740
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,500
little bit the packet that sent it from

741
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:50,040
one client to the server or you can just

742
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,819
relay them to two for example in the

743
00:37:53,819 --> 00:37:57,290
scenario of of cows for example if you

744
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:01,680
if you have a batch tag that is supposed

745
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,450
to open the car you can also really

746
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:07,530
relay the communication between one one

747
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:11,240
interceptor and the DA layer that will

748
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:15,000
that will open the door that's that can

749
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,940
work for for for a lot of technology

750
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:21,150
like maybe normally for cars

751
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:23,549
but that depends also on the technology

752
00:38:23,549 --> 00:38:26,400
because while I was like speaking with

753
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,720
Philip and another guys who does the

754
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,369
training in RFID about is it possible to

755
00:38:35,369 --> 00:38:37,589
relay simply the communication between a

756
00:38:37,589 --> 00:38:41,460
tag and in an access control he said to

757
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:45,539
me that so days like also a timeout that

758
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:48,720
is has to be respected between the tag

759
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,440
and in the in the reader so it does not

760
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,859
work for for a lot of it does not work

761
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:58,410
for some technologies but for others

762
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,140
technology you can always try to do that

763
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:05,789
and what evolutions testbeds

764
00:39:05,789 --> 00:39:09,029
test beds for test bits I recommend that

765
00:39:09,029 --> 00:39:11,339
depends of the technology we want you to

766
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:14,309
do you do to study if you want to study

767
00:39:14,309 --> 00:39:16,980
for example RFID I recommend you use for

768
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,829
example the proxmark and then you can

769
00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:24,420
you can also use another FPGA we just

770
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:28,079
also the RF part that allows you to do

771
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:33,239
they do really attack but also for other

772
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:37,230
technology you can use usurp e and try

773
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:39,299
to relate the communications like for

774
00:39:39,299 --> 00:39:41,789
example just you know using your source

775
00:39:41,789 --> 00:39:45,269
that so will will capture the messengers

776
00:39:45,269 --> 00:39:48,720
and will relay them with another antenna

777
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,119
which will transmit the signature to the

778
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,420
device pretty far away to try if the

779
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:57,150
relays work or not but that depends

780
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:00,000
always on the technology

781
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,099
see see wiki exactly how can we go about

782
00:40:06,099 --> 00:40:09,579
using my attack on the Wyatts IP

783
00:40:09,579 --> 00:40:13,210
surveillance come on IP servers own

784
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:17,440
server arm surveillance cow I can yeah

785
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,589
you can can try to to fetch the the

786
00:40:20,589 --> 00:40:23,730
modem and the y5 mod and Wi-Fi issue

787
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:26,680
modem that is used by the device but

788
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,890
with IP services come I recommend you

789
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:34,720
maybe look at the double layer that that

790
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,029
allows you for example to spell hot

791
00:40:37,029 --> 00:40:37,480
spots

792
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,660
that's all try to to reach the

793
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,039
application part because I think that

794
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,990
maybe the application part can be more

795
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:46,720
interesting than the radio path the

796
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,960
radio part for IP svenska come can be

797
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,079
interesting maybe for or if you have if

798
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:55,660
you can find a vulnerability on the on

799
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:00,789
the Wi-Fi stack but also maybe try to to

800
00:41:00,789 --> 00:41:04,359
do some Daniel services but I don't see

801
00:41:04,359 --> 00:41:06,730
any other attack like like that maybe

802
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,710
there are some butts or means like

803
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,019
mostly about trying to find an ability

804
00:41:11,019 --> 00:41:14,529
on the Wi-Fi stack and do some marginal

805
00:41:14,529 --> 00:41:22,240
in your off services thank you so like

806
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,779
you say there is a ski is a ski FS key

807
00:41:25,779 --> 00:41:29,140
but it can be decoded easily is there

808
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,910
any technique that you can make it out

809
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:34,240
to decode without some info can you do

810
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:39,609
in by degrading to GSM yeah so I mean

811
00:41:39,609 --> 00:41:44,140
that's SKF risky how no easily can be

812
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,039
easily decoded

813
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:49,839
but all those does modulations ordinary

814
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,970
this is the application part that can be

815
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:55,150
used to encrypt the communication or to

816
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:57,400
protect you know product the

817
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,109
communications from configuration

818
00:41:59,109 --> 00:42:01,839
confidentiality so can always use make

819
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:03,599
use of the application power to do that

820
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:09,579
but so to make the decoding harder is no

821
00:42:09,579 --> 00:42:11,160
it's

822
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,420
it's going like you know we're gonna

823
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:15,810
play with the cats and the mouse so are

824
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:18,150
generally dealing with those modulations

825
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:21,960
no it's a pretty easy for for someone

826
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,990
who is used dealing with those

827
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:28,320
modulation and organization but you can

828
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,840
always always try to complexify the the

829
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,630
communication that I using encryption

830
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:38,930
and other things but in the upper layer

831
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:43,800
and what do you do I'm into the red the

832
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,230
GSM what I meant is that yep

833
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,780
I present it's presented it's very

834
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:51,210
quickly done reading the communication

835
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:53,910
is like to jam the communication of one

836
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:57,480
specific frequency for example and for

837
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,240
the mobile part if you operator use for

838
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,840
3G this cell which is connected which

839
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,230
connects the intercom or the mobile

840
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:09,480
together you can for example try to win

841
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,080
to detect the the channels that I use

842
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,480
each channel uses a specific frequency

843
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,650
and there's maybe two three four around

844
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:22,530
and you can just detect them and then

845
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:27,110
jamming jam then in a way to you just

846
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:30,960
you just make the the mobile think that

847
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,260
there is no 3G or 4G T cells around and

848
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:39,930
like that the if the mobile is a and can

849
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:43,050
communicate in gsm 3g 4g for example if

850
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:48,200
I drunk read if I I just jam 4G and 3G

851
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,750
frequencies the mobile will just see the

852
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:56,700
GSM frequencies and the GSM cells which

853
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,670
means it will just look at the GSM

854
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,800
frequencies and then you can for example

855
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,460
use they will get bit years to

856
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:08,580
impersonate a BTS and intercept the the

857
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,920
communication with that being the

858
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:16,550
strongest BTS around the the target

859
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:24,640
so is there a particular good device for

860
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,690
CPR sniffing please I think that's the

861
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:31,180
the good device and I'm still working on

862
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:34,260
it and yeah I didn't had the time to to

863
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:38,230
to do that so we are to release that but

864
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:40,570
I'm still working on the device which is

865
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:44,770
like a deaf kids Cpl deaf kit which

866
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:50,130
allows me to to change you just inject

867
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:53,830
code and also date data in memory

868
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:57,540
demanda dynamically and allow me to also

869
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:01,210
execute what I want in a Cpl I think

870
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:03,580
that is

871
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:06,790
no you you have different kind of simply

872
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:09,220
the stiffener I mean yell cedar sniffing

873
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:11,650
device you can do that so with bladder F

874
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:15,580
with the the tools that that was that

875
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:18,940
was presented before all you can use or

876
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,980
deaf kids but so we're using the deaf

877
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,840
kids you have to do a lot of work by

878
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:26,170
reverse engineering the femur or by by

879
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:29,920
trying to inject some some code to be

880
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,280
able to to do all the introspection but

881
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,860
so this is always a lot of work to do

882
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:38,080
but if you want to do that in radio you

883
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,690
can just you know I will just publish

884
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:44,530
the slides from the this session with

885
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:47,430
this webinar session but you can

886
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:51,390
directly try to reuse the tool that's

887
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:55,330
that's all that was presented in the Cpl

888
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:57,340
part in the radio separate parts you can

889
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:01,990
adapt it to unplug to domestic unplug

890
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:04,510
try to if you if you can you worry about

891
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:07,210
you you sniff some packets but of course

892
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:10,690
or home plug for domestic home plug it's

893
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:13,210
very difficult because it's not like

894
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:15,400
it's not like your home plug green tea

895
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,310
which is like very slow and it's it's

896
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:20,320
supposed to be green so it's a it is

897
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:23,530
like a slowest communication so it uses

898
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:26,280
like you know very also lowest

899
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,920
frequencies but but domestic home plug

900
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,680
use higher frequencies like and and some

901
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,550
you have also two samples like what Eve

902
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:44,089
80 80 80 80 megahertz of sample so it's

903
00:46:44,089 --> 00:46:49,819
no weights a lot and I know and to do

904
00:46:49,819 --> 00:46:53,089
that to do Steve that you you you need a

905
00:46:53,089 --> 00:46:56,569
very expensive device to Steve that but

906
00:46:56,569 --> 00:46:59,720
for what for home plug Greenfield

907
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,970
generally you can use a simple braid

908
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:07,629
area for a USRP and try to sniff them

909
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,869
thank you I don't know if I was clear

910
00:47:11,869 --> 00:47:14,180
but because I have like a lot of things

911
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:19,760
in mind but I'm looking to our question

912
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,410
have you considered what benefit you can

913
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:23,390
have from rap playing machinery

914
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:25,880
automated data analysis from signal as

915
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,930
it simplifies it speeds up and so yeah I

916
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,420
think that machinery is like you know

917
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:35,150
also may be the future of when decoding

918
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:38,740
some signal example if you not able to

919
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:41,230
if you want to reverse engineer

920
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:44,950
communication even if used for example

921
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:49,210
the urh tool you decayed communication

922
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:52,220
sometimes is a lot of structure you

923
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:55,309
cannot decode and by you know doing a

924
00:47:55,309 --> 00:47:59,839
lot of capture and trying to find some

925
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:02,510
interesting pattern using the matching

926
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:05,329
matching learning can be a lot of you

927
00:48:05,329 --> 00:48:07,790
and be very interesting to do so I

928
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:10,549
consider it very much to do audio

929
00:48:10,549 --> 00:48:13,599
analysis work

930
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:19,970
Erica fingerprints what do you mean

931
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:23,750
about fingerprints error fingerprints is

932
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:27,740
that so just like is it the messages

933
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:31,750
while which are sent over the air

934
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:49,580
25 device yeah very it's very I think

935
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:51,530
that's you can you you can maybe also

936
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:53,840
consider a machine airing if you want to

937
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:57,980
to notify some some devices over the air

938
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:00,140
because like that by studying just you

939
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,580
know the communication after the

940
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:05,120
demodulation is very difficult to do

941
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:09,490
that so yeah I didn't try to do all the

942
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:15,320
sorry I didn't try to to do some

943
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:19,160
identification in devices but you can

944
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,770
find you can maybe find fingerprints

945
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:24,620
after the decoding and finding some some

946
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:26,360
codes that are centered in the

947
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:29,090
application part but so like that in

948
00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:33,380
radio is a lot of work to do maybe went

949
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:38,030
to to see what how the pram was ascended

950
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:41,930
and maybe also what's the symbol rates

951
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:44,870
which is which is use or is like a lot

952
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:46,490
of work to do and without the matching

953
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:48,770
machine learning I think that's it's an

954
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:52,460
impossible work to do all very very very

955
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,850
complex

956
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:59,980
- elf but every few apps does the a

957
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:02,740
curve that depends how camera feeds

958
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:05,589
goods for for many purpose but many I

959
00:50:05,589 --> 00:50:09,010
suggest you to use bladder F if you want

960
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:13,119
to artwork on very video you know we

961
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,310
complex signals like for example mobile

962
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:19,300
signals which are which is not no it's

963
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:23,290
not possible to do example for other

964
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:27,660
hacker if I try to power supply my

965
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:30,960
computer yeah

966
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,710
thank you you have any question any more

967
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:47,610
question so I think we are running out

968
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:51,110
of time here

969
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:54,210
Thank You Sebastian for the presentation

970
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:56,250
and all the answers to the questions

971
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:58,350
from the participants
