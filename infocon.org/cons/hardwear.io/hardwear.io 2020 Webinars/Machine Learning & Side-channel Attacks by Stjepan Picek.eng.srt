2
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,080
hello everyone thanks for for coming

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,070
from listening yeah so the topic of of

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,410
the webinar or end of the training Keys

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,650
on is called advanced machine learning

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,990
and inside channel attacks where both

7
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,179
advanced means advanced from from

8
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:29,730
machine learning side and from side

9
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,150
channel side the difference is while I

10
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,460
will assume quite a lot of knowledge

11
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,950
from from side channel perspective from

12
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:38,789
the audience

13
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:40,920
I will not assume so much knowledge from

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,969
the machine learning side and with this

15
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:47,640
we will work in a setting where we will

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,370
start with basic concepts of machine

17
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,010
learning and we will be building our

18
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,920
knowledge until we arrive to to a

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,550
setting where we are able to understand

20
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,340
even advanced constants so this is just

21
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,580
to explain the title its its advanced

22
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,490
both machine learning inside channel but

23
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,830
if you do not have the knowledge of the

24
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,409
machine learning it's fine we will try

25
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:16,170
to build that advanced knowledge well

26
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,500
side channel I assume some something for

27
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,030
instance if you do not know what is

28
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,759
correlation power analysis will not talk

29
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,920
about it as such since it's an important

30
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,500
part of such channel you will be missing

31
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,560
something so be aware of the fact that

32
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,110
this is advanced in that setting so

33
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,560
let's let's talk about the core talk on

34
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,360
social attacks our implementation

35
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,090
attacks and as such they aimed at the

36
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,040
weakness of the implementation of the

37
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,159
algorithm itself from the moment they

38
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,759
started they worked really nice so you

39
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,710
do side channel attack or I don't know

40
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,619
fault injection attack

41
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,470
in essence you could have great hope to

42
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,079
obtain really nice result so compared to

43
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,479
let's say classical crypt analysis often

44
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:05,759
you were able to get much much stronger

45
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,810
announce and during the years people

46
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,930
said well besides side-channel attacks

47
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,870
like simple power analysis differential

48
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,930
power analysis let's we can also do

49
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,300
attacks in this in the form of profound

50
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,080
attacks or profiling attacks there you

51
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,110
assume even more powerful attacker you

52
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,269
assume the attacker saying well the

53
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:32,670
attacker has one device where he will

54
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,370
learn about the device and then he would

55
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,440
use that launch to attack the different

56
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,630
device the one I tell you that you

57
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,540
really want attack so basically usually

58
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,239
we'll call those devices clone device

59
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,810
and target device they should be similar

60
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,819
enough for the attack to be able to work

61
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:54,720
and then with such an approach people

62
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,269
did some attacks like template attack

63
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:01,980
like stochastic attack and the results

64
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,430
were much much better of course there

65
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,739
there was the assumption that you can do

66
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:10,410
that kind of attack so if you were okay

67
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,790
with that assumption and of course

68
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,950
little bit more assumptions that we will

69
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,560
discuss you in the during the training

70
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,950
your toughest fight successful but then

71
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,450
at one moment people realized wait

72
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,209
this template attack is stochastic

73
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:29,750
attack this has the same paradigm as

74
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,000
machine learning so in machine learning

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,530
for instance in supervised machine

76
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:37,400
learning we have training antastic so

77
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,810
said people said well if you have

78
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,730
training and testing that's kind of the

79
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,480
same refining and attacking and then we

80
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,730
started using various machine learning

81
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,940
techniques and the results were quite

82
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,480
successful so we were able to find many

83
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,330
settings where actually machine learning

84
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:00,230
based attacks were even better than than

85
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,720
the other types of attacks here you need

86
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,410
to be a little bit more precise and say

87
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,870
that template attack is also actually in

88
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,120
a very machine learning technique and

89
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,099
stochastic attack is again machine

90
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:15,560
learning but from from the developer

91
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,048
side from the perspective this was

92
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:19,790
something that was done for for

93
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,918
side-channel and then we went into

94
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,440
generic machine learning techniques and

95
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,930
we saw it was quite successful and then

96
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:30,169
even more recently in 2016 people

97
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,050
started using deep learning more

98
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,780
actively and when I say deep learning

99
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:39,260
from 2016 I mean mostly convolutional

100
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,990
neural networks other types of deep

101
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,150
learning like multi-layer perceptron

102
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,810
used even before and the results were

103
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,300
really promising not only that you were

104
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,900
able to break many implementations but

105
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,750
actually we saw that we are able to

106
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,850
break implementations even in the

107
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,960
presence of countermeasures and this was

108
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,349
this was quite big because up to that

109
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:10,220
moment we did not really understand or

110
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,460
know how how successful machine learning

111
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,200
can be against various countermeasures

112
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,380
and in in a way from that moment the

113
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,349
race started so machine learning has a

114
00:05:21,349 --> 00:05:24,020
lot of different techniques and people

115
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,880
started exploring one thing with other

116
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,919
technique which one is better for which

117
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,950
one setting can we improve those and so

118
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,979
on so and the setting is not so easy

119
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:35,960
because in machine learning there is

120
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,190
something called not

121
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,530
lunch theorem the basically says there

122
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,750
exists no single best profiling

123
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,330
algorithm so if there exists no single

124
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,640
best algorithm you are not in a setting

125
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,010
that you can find your best algorithm

126
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,020
and use it always to obtain the best

127
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,110
results that means you need to do a lot

128
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,690
of experiments and of course many

129
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,330
algorithms are quite complex they have a

130
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,210
lot of hyper parameters those hyper

131
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,850
parameters needs to be tuned if you run

132
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,770
obtain really really good results

133
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,720
tuning again is the difficult

134
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,470
perspective so it was it's still

135
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,680
actually quite quite exhausting

136
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,410
procedure to obtain really top results

137
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:22,700
and of course looking from comparing

138
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,770
four with the other domains where

139
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,390
machine learning and deep learning is

140
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,910
used actually we can see that we are

141
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,730
using only a small number of techniques

142
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,850
and let's say even relatively small

143
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,460
architectures often from the deep

144
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,840
learning perspective but still currently

145
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,630
one would be able to say that for many

146
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,790
settings machine learning attacks are

147
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,220
actually giving the best possible

148
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,860
results and from that perspective they

149
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,650
are really interesting for us to explore

150
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,260
because with those kinds of attacks so

151
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,810
you are able to get the best results but

152
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:03,650
there is additional advantage of machine

153
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,200
learning techniques is that this

154
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,780
knowledge you can also use for four

155
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,169
different domains so it's not only that

156
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:13,840
you need to use it for side-channel

157
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,400
because realistically your machine

158
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,169
learning algorithm does not know what is

159
00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:20,690
side Sharna it knows it has data it

160
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,940
works with data so as long as you are

161
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,040
able to understand what your algorithm

162
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,110
does what you need to prepare for your

163
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:31,010
algorithm to be good you are just able

164
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,890
to run your machine learning for

165
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:37,250
different data sets different security

166
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,130
problems but also stuff well beyond

167
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:43,240
security so from that side I believe

168
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,890
this knowledge of machine learning is

169
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,780
quite nice because it's

170
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,600
much more general than just such an

171
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:55,100
optimist when talking about my my

172
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,570
training I will be giving so will start

173
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,430
let's say simple we'll start with some

174
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,130
basic concepts for such an Allah tax so

175
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,480
although I said we will not go into

176
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,400
details but we will cover some stuff

177
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,910
then we will talk about basic concepts

178
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,919
of machine learning so for people that

179
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:15,530
did not really encounter it before used

180
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:18,139
it before so for them to understand what

181
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:20,470
are we actually doing how do we do and

182
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:25,370
then we slowly start going into core

183
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,669
topic so first I discussed template

184
00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:30,140
attack in the context of machine

185
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,120
learning and then I talk about more

186
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,799
advanced concepts for machine learning

187
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:36,890
so in this point we will already leave

188
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,860
from from the stuff that you can learn

189
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,710
basically one hour just browsing online

190
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:45,170
but we will go really into details that

191
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,200
we will try at least or a couple of

192
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,700
techniques couple of machine learning

193
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,070
algorithms to understand really how they

194
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:55,310
work and then once we have that

195
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:58,400
knowledge we can go into let's say

196
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,280
preparation phase of the attack because

197
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,589
while often with deep learning you do

198
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:06,200
not need this kind of preparation you

199
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,589
can just say well I can use raw traces

200
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:12,530
will still discuss how to do the

201
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,450
pre-processing how to do the feature

202
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:17,420
engineering because often you have way

203
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,920
too many pictures then you want to use

204
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,050
and then you can do feature selection

205
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,540
you can do feature engineering

206
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,560
dimensionality reduction various

207
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,520
techniques that differ in in underlying

208
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,100
idea but differ also in the complexities

209
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,530
of some techniques are really simple so

210
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:36,130
if you want to do Pearson correlation

211
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,360
for feature selection that's really

212
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,940
simple if you want to do some kind of

213
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,520
wrapper method that use has no support

214
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,500
vector machines to select your most

215
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,470
important features that's quite

216
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:51,770
computationally cavity and then yeah we

217
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:54,980
go for several machine learning

218
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,110
techniques will go really into into

219
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,360
details on a bias when the forward

220
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,620
support vector machine

221
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,460
and we'll talk how to implement such

222
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,980
techniques I don't how to run it how to

223
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,950
properly prepare and so on so there we

224
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,980
will also use that knowledge to really

225
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,980
attack some of the data sets some of the

226
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,770
data sets for side channels so I will

227
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:22,370
prepare a number of relevant data sets

228
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:26,390
for us to experiment with after that

229
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,180
let's call this more classical machine

230
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,730
learning we will go into deep learning

231
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,830
based attacks and then we will talk

232
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,990
about theory for deep learning will talk

233
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,180
about multi-layer perceptron collusion

234
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,180
Network how to implement such such

235
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,420
techniques such machine learning methods

236
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,810
being in chaos will use those techniques

237
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:50,620
to attack we'll compare it with other

238
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,730
techniques with simple techniques

239
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:56,360
because often you also need to ask the

240
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,850
question well maybe my deep learning is

241
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:02,260
little bit more successful than my

242
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,060
simple machine and technique but it's

243
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,000
still much more computationally heavy so

244
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,860
the question is does it really

245
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:13,250
worthwhile to invest so much time into

246
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,560
into hyper parameter tuning into this

247
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,880
into that or for only marginal game and

248
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,120
we'll also discuss depending on the time

249
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,940
depending on on the interest of the

250
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,130
audience other deep learning techniques

251
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,500
so deep learning is this much more than

252
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,150
just multi-layer perceptrons and

253
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,280
convolutional neural networks there are

254
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,530
many many many techniques one can use

255
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:40,910
and will cover several more there will

256
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:43,100
be a possibility to the first day that

257
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,500
the participants say what kind of

258
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,020
technique they consider important for

259
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,290
them and then I can also tune my

260
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,760
tutorial in the second day to include

261
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,290
that kind of technique if it beats and

262
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:00,440
finally we will talk about beyond side

263
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,680
channel analysis and we'll talk about

264
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,510
what can we do for instance in fault

265
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:08,270
injection with artificial intelligence

266
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,580
how transferable is our knowledge to

267
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,860
other security domains and so on so

268
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:19,560
businesses to the basic the basic idea

269
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,440
of the tutorials so I would say it will

270
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,949
be both heavy on on discussion on on

271
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:28,589
theory so for you to really get some of

272
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:32,040
those advanced concepts and of course a

273
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,160
disclaimer we will not be able in only

274
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,699
two days to cover everything so

275
00:12:37,699 --> 00:12:39,839
unfortunately it's not possible that you

276
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,899
do a two day tutorial and you say well I

277
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,810
covered all the material like I would

278
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:50,069
cover in three years of official program

279
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:51,899
at the university because that's

280
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:54,889
impossible but you will be able to

281
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:57,240
understand several techniques you will

282
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,279
be able to implement them you will be

283
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,649
able to use them and you will be able to

284
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:05,069
obtain really good results for

285
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:06,810
side-channel datasets for some other

286
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,910
security problems well you will see okay

287
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,430
now I really know what I'm doing how I'm

288
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:14,430
doing it why I'm doing it and then from

289
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,490
that point it's s'more or less on you to

290
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:21,779
to continue in education to expand your

291
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:25,160
knowledge and so on
