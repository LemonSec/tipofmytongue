2
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,240
so what happened we all know that from

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,519
academic perspective psychoanalysis for

4
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,820
dear life 1996 or so with differential

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,560
power analysis but since that's not

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,050
profile let's leave that away and

7
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,500
profile attacks let's say almost 20

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,360
years ago what was there

9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,320
well 2002 there was template in fact in

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,700
Depok attack was quite well victim that

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,820
appeared because not only was something

12
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,370
new something different but also it's

13
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,199
the most powerful attack from the

14
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,420
information collected point of view so

15
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,120
extremely powerful thing well

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,699
immediately one can ask if it's so

17
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,890
powerful why do we continue why do we

18
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,049
all the time try to envision something

19
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:05,820
make some people well

20
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,310
template attack is so powerful only

21
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,860
quite a lot of assumptions are fulfilled

22
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,320
since in reality many of those are not

23
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,259
fulfilled template attack will be often

24
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,350
much weaker than we hope and then over

25
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,990
time also some variations from peers

26
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,270
opens this old template attack that

27
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,460
solved some problems with instability of

28
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,560
covariance matrix system template attack

29
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,040
and strong but also stochastic models

30
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,549
and now this is interesting because

31
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:37,350
these attacks recall only do not

32
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,060
consider as machine learning based

33
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,790
attacks they are profile attacks next

34
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,649
slide I will going to give us what

35
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:45,840
proper means but commonly we do not

36
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,689
consider this as machine learning but

37
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:51,509
actually there is a lot of prashila in

38
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:53,729
behind of this know behind every attack

39
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:56,189
is politic discriminant analysis behind

40
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:58,770
potentate attackers linear discriminant

41
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,110
analysis behind stochastic model sees

42
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,600
regression so there is a lot of

43
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,170
connection but still the combinations

44
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,729
are that moment we did not talk about

45
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,459
machine learning skill with find that

46
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:12,540
excluded

47
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,019
from machine learning to thoughts what

48
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:17,579
are those broke all the tags that we

49
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:20,609
care the proper the tax or to station

50
00:02:20,609 --> 00:02:23,219
tasks are exactly what the namespace and

51
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:25,650
that's the company in two states there

52
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,409
is the first stage the profiling phase

53
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:31,709
where us the attacker has the same type

54
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:34,500
of device under your control and use

55
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,870
that control to learn a lot about the

56
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,299
demarks here on the schematics this is

57
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:41,849
the identical coffee pot so you have

58
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:44,310
your identical copy you learn as much as

59
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,730
possible about your device so in the

60
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,280
lingo of temporary tab we would say we

61
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,220
build a template in the language of

62
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,409
machinery we would say we built a

63
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:58,500
machine learning and then in the other

64
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,989
things the attachment is the online face

65
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:04,079
we attack the second device device on

66
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:06,930
their path they use the knowledge from

67
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,970
the first place and that knowledge

68
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,099
actually helps us to make the attack

69
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,950
much much more power so that components

70
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,290
of profile attacks when compared the

71
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,359
direct attacks like correlation power

72
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:21,150
analysis patient correlation paralysis

73
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,299
is extremely powerful but you need a lot

74
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:26,699
of measurements probably to do something

75
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:29,819
with proper attacks you have some

76
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:33,120
promise that if our profound part is

77
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,489
very good we can break the target in

78
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:37,709
only a single measurement so that's the

79
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:39,540
nice part about the profile attacks

80
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,260
there is that magical boundary yes if

81
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,329
your profile is perfect you will break

82
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:49,019
the target a single trace understand

83
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:51,569
some function and of course in reality

84
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:54,479
we rarely relative monster ease but we

85
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,449
still break it much more with much less

86
00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:00,239
traces from more efficiently then if

87
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,709
doing direct attacks

88
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:04,620
so that's the eutteum of course on the

89
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,290
other hand is that part when we say well

90
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,810
you need to have the identical copy for

91
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,239
device what happens if you don't commit

92
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,150
well in academia be commonly are not

93
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,759
caring so much about it and you will see

94
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,089
also that in results common in academia

95
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:23,520
we say well they are two devices and

96
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,570
that's perfectly fine

97
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,400
but let's make our lives

98
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,380
but it now head everything simpler the

99
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,150
result let's say there is only one

100
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,830
device and then we will artificially

101
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,010
divide the measurements and say these

102
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,710
part of measurements belongs me first of

103
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,690
all and then the second part of the

104
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,220
measurements belongs to the second

105
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,889
device so we are kind of mimicking the

106
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:46,139
wheel setting in this saying well this

107
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:48,900
is close enough because if our talk is

108
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,000
not successful here in more difficult

109
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,580
setting it will be even less etcetera so

110
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,130
from the evaluation point of view a lot

111
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:00,060
of our perspective I said be a volume if

112
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,340
you do this movie that's what exactly do

113
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,970
we do well we do the attack to to see

114
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,650
what is the performance of the attack

115
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:10,590
and how do you bother it what are the

116
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,400
performance of the attack well it matrix

117
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,010
such like like here and like success

118
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,990
rate by guessing entity

119
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,150
I will not go into details but what's

120
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,580
important to know is we basically wanna

121
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,550
see on what position is the correct key

122
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,220
in our list of guest keys so if your

123
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,950
guest key is very high that means your

124
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,210
attack is very powerful

125
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,270
if your guess key is very far from best

126
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,880
guess that means you're guessing model

127
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,130
is very bad so your attack is very bad

128
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,919
so with all these metrics you came to

129
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,970
get your best guess key to be hopefully

130
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:51,210
correctly and if not correct as close as

131
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,310
possible to the correct one here I just

132
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,729
give expression how one would hardly it

133
00:05:56,729 --> 00:05:59,400
or probabilities so we can discuss it

134
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,340
later but I don't know man

135
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,080
so this is genuine this is profile of

136
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,750
facts but let's see now what happens

137
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,690
with my human and yes already same time

138
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,669
a template attacks because more than

139
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:13,410
this is all connected with machine

140
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,699
learning but let's go into clean machine

141
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:19,979
so what happened let's take ten years

142
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:20,430
ago

143
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,139
this is already a little bit more fuzzy

144
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,479
because there were more papers it's very

145
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,760
hard to state what paper appeared first

146
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,010
and at one point which really start to

147
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,229
get a good result but actually people

148
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:32,699
recognize that machine learning

149
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:35,490
techniques and actually supervised

150
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,340
learning also belongs to profile of

151
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,680
facts so

152
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,990
the same setting as incoming for follow

153
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,230
facts profiling and upon him we get the

154
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,640
same supervised machine learning

155
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,400
supervised machine learning training and

156
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:55,940
testing the same as it sounds natural it

157
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,520
should work but of course they also

158
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,920
realized much more can be done with

159
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,550
machinery

160
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:04,550
so while even today machine learning is

161
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,280
most well known for doing the attack

162
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,650
itself but you can do many more stuff

163
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,260
you can do preprocessor so various

164
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,880
alignments you can do feature

165
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,820
engineering select features transport

166
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,430
features do a lot of steps that to make

167
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,800
your attack much more power maybe even

168
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,490
not needing so fancy machine learning in

169
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:28,880
the end if you do put proposal so this

170
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,220
is also the part of the promise of

171
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,840
machine learning there are many

172
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,660
techniques many different goals it's not

173
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,970
only about the attack but about the

174
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:43,100
whole environment what is machine

175
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:43,700
learning

176
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,800
of course I will kind of almost skip

177
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,530
this slide but it's a pillow study that

178
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,210
use computers their ability to learn

179
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,610
without being specific program what does

180
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:56,420
it mean for us in faction it learns how

181
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:00,290
to classify the sbox outputs or around

182
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,990
outputs for certain classes labels

183
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,960
without being explicitly programmed to

184
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,690
recognize this marks to this this must

185
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:13,310
be done so it's it's a big how we can is

186
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:17,450
our life and do recognition away

187
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:21,080
in a very efficient way so what are the

188
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,590
types of machine what do we actually use

189
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:28,220
because machinery is you here are just

190
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,310
sometimes machine so this is on the

191
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,110
basis of the feedback there is the

192
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,539
supervisor there is unsupervised

193
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:36,110
learning

194
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,480
semi-supervised learning and so on and

195
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,440
so on and so if we talk about my channel

196
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,250
or tasks or symmetric in crypto call

197
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,900
only the main role is supervisor if we

198
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,180
talk about public equal

199
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,610
people started more with unsupervised

200
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:59,029
learning its various bustling ideas and

201
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:01,490
more recently actually people are moving

202
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:06,470
in to supervise and semi-supervised is

203
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,320
some strange sleeping like supervised

204
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,620
but it not a lot of measurements so you

205
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,130
can still do something I will just give

206
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,959
a rough estimate supervised learning

207
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:21,850
inside channel I would say 95% of papers

208
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,010
unsupervised couple of percent

209
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:27,470
semi-supervised I know two papers that

210
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,200
do same super master section and

211
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,020
actually it's very strange setting

212
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,230
because of course it's a big attack but

213
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,360
still doing something so people are not

214
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,890
worried about to think about so

215
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,700
supervised learning is the most

216
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,450
important what is well we have our

217
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,339
training things you come out open

218
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:53,149
instead you have our training pairs X&Y

219
00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:56,300
extra it's races why are the labels from

220
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,630
s box outputs or round outputs or heavy

221
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,130
weights and in distance of those

222
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:04,400
variables and then X is commonly known

223
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,070
as the feature vector because every

224
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,589
every way in that vector is a feature

225
00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:13,160
and why is the label and our objective

226
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,400
is to find a function f such that y is

227
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,750
equal to f of X and then if Y is a real

228
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,570
number we talk about regression if Y is

229
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,029
a boolean variable we talk about binary

230
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:28,820
classification and if Y is a member of

231
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,640
Finance that multi class specification

232
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,010
and actually you can see that mostly

233
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,959
people today do multi class

234
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:38,270
specification and for instance in the

235
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,029
setting of block ciphers we mostly

236
00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:44,300
check what what happens with a yes and

237
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,970
then in alias you would commonly come

238
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:49,339
nine classes so Martha class

239
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:51,680
specification of nine classes if you

240
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,550
have Hemingway can business models or

241
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:57,860
256 classes if you have the sbox

242
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,980
outreach model identity map so this is

243
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,890
the supervised learning pacification and

244
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,500
multi class both people

245
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,590
and this worked very much actually one

246
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,210
of the last slides I will also show you

247
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:16,650
couple of exerts on various papers doing

248
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,290
the techniques here but what's important

249
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,750
to note people play with a lot of

250
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,450
diffuse but those techniques are all a

251
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,080
small part of what there is and still it

252
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,780
makes like random forest like support

253
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,330
vector machines worked quite well

254
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:36,000
and it was very successful people also

255
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,460
use immediately say multi-layer

256
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,590
perceptrons and this is also an

257
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:44,220
interesting question I'm not really sure

258
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,440
honestly at one point multi-layered

259
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,300
lesson plans were really used in deep

260
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,640
learning versus they were just used in

261
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,790
machine man so where many some out to

262
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,340
their personal deep learning when it was

263
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:00,180
more than one hidden way but notice that

264
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,270
mean all the papers and such an analysis

265
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,150
in multi-layer perceptrons researchers

266
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,190
commonly do not mention the number of

267
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,200
hidden layers so actually it's very

268
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,140
difficult to know is it machine learning

269
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,020
is it deep learning but what is the play

270
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:19,800
and why do we do it so here I put the

271
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,770
type of four years ago and then question

272
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:25,580
because I really do not know when is not

273
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,310
convolutional neural networks appeared

274
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,260
2016 so that's why I write four years

275
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,770
ago and why do we like to play because

276
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:37,680
it can reach top performance even if

277
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,660
device is protected with countermeasures

278
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,460
I don't like to talk too much about

279
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,080
countermeasures because we have only 30

280
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,550
minutes but they are masking

281
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,420
countermeasures

282
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,090
they're hiding countermeasures but deep

283
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:51,000
learning is good for both hospitals and

284
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,550
we like it because it works great of

285
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:57,060
course but also because it allows us to

286
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,120
be able to be placing because common

287
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,070
machine learning simple techniques we

288
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,660
need to do those key change in

289
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,630
philosophy steps here the deep learning

290
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:09,270
the commonly just input your own

291
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,580
features and we leave everything for the

292
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:15,120
algorithm so it allows us to to skip one

293
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,980
face and just leave it for the algorithm

294
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,380
this is also one very nice part why the

295
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,010
one

296
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:24,150
while many people like people but that

297
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,070
unfortunately at the same times also

298
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,740
means we do not know how to explain

299
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,020
what's happening inside deep learning

300
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:34,710
very well so how do we give common deep

301
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,320
learning these things that that appear

302
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,960
inside channel well we start with a new

303
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,410
role they make many of us you connect

304
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,570
them this is already called multi-layer

305
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:48,540
perceptron because we have multiple

306
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,510
layers and then this is one example of

307
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:54,210
our neural net so you can see here I

308
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,310
write many hidden layers under

309
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,090
quotations

310
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,400
it's not so many but think of it like

311
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,260
crazy many levels but we can also do

312
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:07,380
network of this shape only one hidden

313
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,140
layer and many many new words again this

314
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,320
is number of lures are not so huge but

315
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,600
think of it like having thousands and

316
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,430
thousands tens of thousands of minutes

317
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,560
and then it's also difficult question to

318
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,950
say well what architecture would be

319
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:23,550
better

320
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,880
do we take one we can be another so this

321
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,000
is also opening a lot of perspectives

322
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,840
how to make the best architecture and

323
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,390
this is one example of let's say common

324
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,910
convolutional neural network in spite

325
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:42,780
generalizes what can we see here let me

326
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,740
tell you immediately

327
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,570
this is not the best neural network

328
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:48,690
there is it's one common example up to

329
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,630
last year but what we can see here that

330
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:54,090
actually this neural network is not very

331
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,640
deep so it's couple of comminution

332
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,470
layers it's couple of fooling layers

333
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,480
little bit low power little bit better

334
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,450
normalization nothing much and still

335
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:06,450
works way and actually the same

336
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:09,030
architecture weren't great to break a

337
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:13,050
lot of different implementations of aes

338
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,870
we and without countermeasures hiding

339
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,760
they must accomplish but this

340
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,780
architecture also was used to break

341
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:24,030
public key electrically a elliptic curve

342
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,890
cryptography it's only a single

343
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:28,740
measurement in their tactics but quite

344
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,850
general structure in the way

345
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,160
and still able to do a lot but I

346
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,050
shouldn't understand if you look at the

347
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,720
big picture so this is the big let's see

348
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,680
big picture first is Alison where almost

349
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,959
everything started seriously portfolio

350
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,889
genre then vgg the architectural shown

351
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:51,709
is also the VDD time and then resonant

352
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:55,490
and here you can see the the ratio of

353
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,699
the spices these sizes are really

354
00:15:57,699 --> 00:16:00,350
correct so ratios are correct

355
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:03,440
now I can tell you the network I've

356
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,529
shown you is so much smaller than this

357
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:10,250
building and up to recently that

358
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,649
architecture precise channel analysis

359
00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:15,139
but great and even more recently

360
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:18,470
researchers they make much more

361
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:21,290
architectures that work even better so

362
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:24,649
here are very much somewhere so this one

363
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:28,910
already tells us ok we do deployment and

364
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,949
there is a reason why we do deployment

365
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:34,009
but deep learning winning versus much

366
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:35,870
deep learning are used in other domains

367
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,079
it's very much different so we are very

368
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:42,350
much script kiddies or many other

369
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,630
domains when they regarded from the size

370
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,029
of the network that we need we can use

371
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:49,399
bigger but apparently at least for now

372
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:53,420
there doesn't seem to be a lot of me so

373
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,759
what are the common results these are

374
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,759
just coupled to me to be emphasis on

375
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:03,290
stock so here I write I picked four

376
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:06,409
column newspapers this is also money the

377
00:17:06,409 --> 00:17:09,380
big issues for our domain we do not have

378
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,260
good public Lea of available data but

379
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,720
with hot Sun and they are good but we do

380
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,359
not coming and when you are very limited

381
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,150
in data sets you can use you are never

382
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:23,119
sure if what we are doing is really the

383
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,429
best way how to do it but here you can

384
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:28,610
see DPA contest before they said this is

385
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:31,100
the common one people start this is

386
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,070
something you can see also from the from

387
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,630
how the features look like the

388
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,710
importance these data is very easy to do

389
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:42,409
then you have some data like this this

390
00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:43,490
is very much

391
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:44,610
quite difficult

392
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:47,820
very from that history both of these

393
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,160
datasets commonly do not have a mountain

394
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,670
oops

395
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,500
then you have something that has a

396
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,240
hiding fountain that you random delay

397
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,460
fountain issue so something happening in

398
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,390
the time domain

399
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:00,420
hey Oscar that has a masking

400
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,059
countermeasure and today most of the

401
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:04,890
research that they asked that as the

402
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,890
standard data to do the test so let's

403
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,780
say these are the common data sets

404
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,049
people considered and I don't know again

405
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:15,750
go into details but for instance this is

406
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,400
one in the fiction of the results you

407
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,799
get that he created for that very easy

408
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,620
data set and deeper so you can see me

409
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,049
break the target it's two three four

410
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:28,290
five things in essence extremely easy to

411
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:32,850
break even something must still break it

412
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,429
with a couple of hundreds and these

413
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:36,870
result like I said I'm not even

414
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:37,830
state-of-the-art

415
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,110
anymore so I think now you can probably

416
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:43,020
break it with confidence so we are

417
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,059
already quite mature and breaking the

418
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:48,320
data signal that we have followed for me

419
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,480
and of course this is the deep learning

420
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,980
for breaking the time but we can't

421
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,470
luckily to still some other stuff you

422
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,049
remember I said we do not need to do

423
00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:03,390
pre-processing because deep learning to

424
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:06,510
do everything part but we can do the

425
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,299
first and actually I think this is one

426
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:11,100
of the more interesting directions to go

427
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,549
now how to do good pre-processing for

428
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:16,140
deep learning to make the attack even

429
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,510
better so for instance here this has

430
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:22,740
been Oscar the intercept and here we

431
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,140
also to ask the data that we added the

432
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,660
random delay countermeasure so random

433
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,510
delayed withdraw and this chance we

434
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,970
implemented in a quite difficult late

435
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,070
this is very difficult for the neural

436
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,410
network to bed so you can see the even

437
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,120
the best attack let's say temperature

438
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,690
part for CNN yes again loop is not very

439
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:43,110
good

440
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,030
guessing entered your fifty will not

441
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:50,010
bring you breaking him but then look

442
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,320
what happens if we add convolutional

443
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,590
encoder something that three processes

444
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,830
and basically learns how to remove the

445
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,759
from a legend from something that is

446
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:04,950
extremely difficult to break to

447
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,950
something that is extremely easy but

448
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,259
this is in my opinion very interesting

449
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:13,259
perspective for for us that are

450
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:15,809
interested in deep learning inside

451
00:20:15,809 --> 00:20:19,200
channel to go beyond attacking only

452
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,570
attack we need to think what more can be

453
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,669
done what are the new interesting

454
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:27,179
directions we can take the really hot

455
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:28,980
promise we'll be learning and there are

456
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,580
not other techniques we can actually use

457
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:35,299
and also this is what I told you

458
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:38,879
mitching retreat in academia very simple

459
00:20:38,879 --> 00:20:41,970
saying well we take one device and we

460
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,519
pretend those are two device so it's not

461
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:49,429
really the case well here i depict one

462
00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:52,080
one attack with multi-layer fashion

463
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,809
don't be deep learning when we do chew

464
00:20:54,809 --> 00:20:57,149
then you have basically the same device

465
00:20:57,149 --> 00:20:59,279
with the same key so you can see

466
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:01,940
guessing entropy around to one of them

467
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:06,269
extremely easy to break so no problem at

468
00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:09,960
all the two traits is your baby and this

469
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,870
is very easy target but this is what

470
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,840
happens if you attack different of us

471
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,960
it's so the same type of device but it's

472
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,360
two different samples and they have

473
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,879
different keys because that's reality

474
00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:26,309
the key you have on your device would

475
00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:28,289
not be the same as the key as you come

476
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:29,820
on the earth arguments otherwise that

477
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:33,090
would be very straight set and here we

478
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,889
can see that for many attacks we are

479
00:21:34,889 --> 00:21:37,769
each actually not even able to break so

480
00:21:37,769 --> 00:21:40,799
this tells us that from one side our

481
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,350
results with deep learning are great and

482
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,909
we are pushing forward when we are

483
00:21:44,909 --> 00:21:47,190
saying we are managing to break many

484
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,889
stuff very easily but on the other hand

485
00:21:49,889 --> 00:21:53,250
side you see what we are far because we

486
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,980
do some assumptions with a lot we are so

487
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,529
inside interesting they how to connect

488
00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:02,519
it in those and I more or less all the

489
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:04,950
time so let me give you a little bit on

490
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:08,190
the conclusion part so this is this is

491
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:10,679
just a slide I prepared some time ago so

492
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:11,520
it's awesome

493
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,520
the latest up-to-date with papers that

494
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,760
consider machine learning for a task and

495
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,059
you can actually see what well first

496
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:23,370
it's quite this a number of papers there

497
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:25,650
is a lot of research happening and most

498
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,540
of these papers up in the last half

499
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:32,220
years and also from the other side we

500
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,350
can see that the number of the things

501
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:38,880
the people really use is very supervised

502
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,910
machine learning has dozens hundreds of

503
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:44,309
the heels here we what become one two

504
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:47,880
three four paws but the things so we

505
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,480
actually tried only a small part and I'm

506
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,730
not saying we need to try everything but

507
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,920
the question is did you try really the

508
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,920
most important the best choice that's

509
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,290
but a big question because there is also

510
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:03,270
they're not free lunch the end saying

511
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,370
there is no single best algorithm for

512
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:08,910
all the problems so it's maybe to watch

513
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:11,100
to expect you can find one algorithm for

514
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,790
all our daters but should we also expect

515
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,770
that there are no better algorithms in

516
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,350
general thanks it's an interesting

517
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:23,000
question to see what is the number of

518
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,679
exploration versus exploitation what

519
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,470
point do we stay fine I do not want to

520
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,630
explore any more machine learning it

521
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:33,179
means any more different things but now

522
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:35,190
I really want to learn that it learning

523
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:38,550
to me and you was it in the best way

524
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,280
because big part of it for these but

525
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,559
I've actually completely skipped up to

526
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:46,710
now is with hybrid parameters Union the

527
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,840
more complicated techniques you use they

528
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,450
have more hyper parameters more settings

529
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:54,120
you need to select we talked about deep

530
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,390
learning and I said key the layers okay

531
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:00,210
how many people means one two three four

532
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:03,510
five 55 so Alex that has eight layers

533
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:06,570
but the resident has 152 layers how do

534
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,420
you select well only with a lot of

535
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,870
experience and a lot of experience so

536
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:16,590
there is also bad trade and also what I

537
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,960
want to say why I are deep learning the

538
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,270
moves working so nicely for those

539
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,800
publicly available data

540
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,710
so when we talk about hiding

541
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,850
countermeasure hiding how to measure

542
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:30,500
comes in depend on it

543
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,110
and there for instance something like

544
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,360
convolution you know that was but great

545
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,480
why well because emotional and that was

546
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,670
from the property of spatial invariance

547
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:44,690
so ocean or that blendable a nice rock

548
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,940
that changing the time domain that

549
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,130
misalignment if you wanna say it like

550
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:51,680
that does not pose a problem

551
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,770
so convolutional neural network is

552
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:56,720
inherently adapt to fight against

553
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,120
countermeasure like that and on the

554
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,780
other hand side but not is it mask let's

555
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:05,090
think how do we how do we attack must

556
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,980
latest there'll be no higher order

557
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,220
thought what aspire or their fun we

558
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,290
combine the features we try to combine

559
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:15,070
the feature on the value and on the mask

560
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:17,990
but isn't that what fully connected

561
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:20,120
layer in multiplayer products it

562
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,010
connects very featured to every feature

563
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:25,310
so you do get the same combination of

564
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,230
all the features so you do commit

565
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:30,290
combine both maths and the sensitive

566
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:32,150
information but that's right

567
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:35,300
deep learning is quite adapt to both

568
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,730
masking and hiding because it does

569
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:41,840
something quite natural so what are the

570
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,150
challenges so this is the part when I

571
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:46,280
said what are the challenges we need to

572
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,650
explore well how do you select those

573
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:51,110
machine learning how do we do our high

574
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,480
profile Matic Union

575
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,480
many people do random search or research

576
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,880
or this or that and we are actually not

577
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,310
even sure how important is it do you

578
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,530
really need to fuel along or can be just

579
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:06,350
a couple of experiments and be done then

580
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:09,170
deportability one device versus two

581
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:12,860
devices lacks a lack of data's this is

582
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,410
what I already said in the community

583
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,450
extreme ability I think this is

584
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,720
extremely important as not only carry

585
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,890
the attack but knowing why the attackers

586
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:27,020
interpreting results and explaining the

587
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,820
neural network that's a big challenge

588
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,860
and of course that's a challenge for for

589
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,260
machinery domain so one would say well

590
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,170
this is too much velocity small but we

591
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:36,780
are

592
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,970
we are limiting our attention with a

593
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:41,250
small number of problems so for us it's

594
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,750
easier because we do not care about

595
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:47,490
image classification this time yeah big

596
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,560
problem there is no clear connection

597
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,720
between machine there are general

598
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,780
metrics so when you do your side channel

599
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,180
attack I said you care about Kevon to

600
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,400
care about gets me through successfully

601
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,970
but maybe do your machine train us

602
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:07,860
almost if you have a good accuracy

603
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,590
doesn't mean you will baby target not

604
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:13,530
always just in your Hemingway scenario

605
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:18,330
heavyweight you can tell you everything

606
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,550
is coming wait for and your accuracy

607
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:24,420
will be 27% because all the numbers

608
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:28,800
between 0 and 255 70 numbers has been

609
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,300
delayed for so 70 divided by 256 it's

610
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,520
27% so you can have extremely stupid

611
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,830
machine on how to get all smart you want

612
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,770
to move it from duck style but that

613
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:43,860
cannot help you breaking so what kind of

614
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,500
matrix do we need for our smart channel

615
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,650
and then calculate how do we call where

616
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:51,060
to counter measure how do we work

617
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:55,170
against them also one important thing we

618
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:57,150
are solving problems that we already

619
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,940
know how to stop we are attacking data

620
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,010
sets but we knew how to attack even

621
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:05,400
before tea play so we also need to go

622
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,950
further we need to look at the problems

623
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,960
that we do not know how to solve it

624
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,390
other things this is the challenge not

625
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:15,060
only doing like other people did and

626
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:19,470
something better something new we are

627
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,240
very much like in any kind of

628
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,010
methodology any kind of flavor

629
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:25,650
how do we set our experience how do we

630
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,380
say this is better that's worse so quite

631
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:32,160
a lot of open fissures and also some

632
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,490
some more general things they're big

633
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,560
where do people use machine learning in

634
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,140
general means in cryptography because

635
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,810
the implementation tasks cryptography so

636
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:45,930
side-channel we thought also you can

637
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,730
easily use it informative fault

638
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:50,070
injection but also model in the past

639
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:53,520
parce detecting how the Trojans machine

640
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,090
learning to identify topics like that

641
00:28:56,090 --> 00:29:00,000
but also for crypt analysis people child

642
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,940
if they're trying machinery for

643
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,610
factoring numbers for designs of ciphers

644
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,460
there is a lot of aspects what we need

645
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:11,280
to be aware is the machine learning

646
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,290
algorithms do not know what they are

647
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:13,680
doing

648
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,960
we feed every data machine learning

649
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,240
algorithm does not care with crypto data

650
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,380
or his image so actually became use

651
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,600
machine learning techniques for a wide

652
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,810
variety of folks the questions recognize

653
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:30,270
those problems that they really see that

654
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,970
we need to solve that we do not know how

655
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:36,630
to swap record that's the champ and

656
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:40,260
finally yes machine learning in my

657
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,720
opinion plays very important role in

658
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,270
cyber security and that role will just

659
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:47,640
go up and on fire because in the end

660
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,880
what do you wanna be one good results in

661
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,550
an automated way we wanna exclude a

662
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,590
chance of human error they would like

663
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:58,050
the attack to work on so we would like

664
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:00,690
the design to be done at market so

665
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:03,270
avoiding human error make it faster make

666
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:08,100
it easier and today implementation task

667
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,920
machine advanced efficient it seems the

668
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,750
most powerful option people are very

669
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:16,410
happy to do so but still but we need

670
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:19,260
inside shadow or twist currently seems

671
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,540
to be much important what we need in

672
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:24,420
other domains and of course there are

673
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,460
many many thoughts acknowledged from

674
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,620
other domains we can be used to my

675
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,380
advices before trying to invent

676
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,290
something completely new see if someone

677
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,600
try to solve the same from other domain

678
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,210
but same common probably yes our

679
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:42,000
problems are not so relieved so there is

680
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,710
a good chance there is already a good

681
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:47,580
solution son and final point which I

682
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,170
think it's extremely important for all

683
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:52,860
of us to think about it why are we in

684
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,410
the game of autonomy we are in the game

685
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:58,140
of attacking so that in the end we can

686
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:01,560
design more secure device so when we are

687
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,299
using deep learning for the time

688
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:05,879
and breaking pockets that's great but

689
00:31:05,879 --> 00:31:08,999
how does our new about teaches us how to

690
00:31:08,999 --> 00:31:12,029
make the better design if I tell you my

691
00:31:12,029 --> 00:31:14,909
deep learning broke this target amazing

692
00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:17,700
but how can I use that knowledge to make

693
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,950
a better - better how to measure in

694
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:22,169
future so this is something anything

695
00:31:22,169 --> 00:31:25,529
what is is it deep learning doing and

696
00:31:25,529 --> 00:31:28,559
how do we make better products in the

697
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,779
future because in the end that's the

698
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:33,659
game we are in the game of making most

699
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:36,450
beautiful and we evaluated with such an

700
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:41,789
artist and thank you for your attention

701
00:31:41,789 --> 00:31:48,059
I do also have stop sharing and start

702
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:53,489
sharing I just want to share so this

703
00:31:53,489 --> 00:31:57,090
screen this is also I hope very

704
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:01,289
interesting and very simplistic example

705
00:32:01,289 --> 00:32:04,169
what I want to tell you when people

706
00:32:04,169 --> 00:32:05,820
start in the template attack is the

707
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:09,149
cosmic models actually the settings were

708
00:32:09,149 --> 00:32:12,239
favors for development for much less

709
00:32:12,239 --> 00:32:14,759
developed and if you wanted to do attack

710
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:17,039
you really needed to do some coding to

711
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,289
do a lot of recreation but think of it

712
00:32:19,289 --> 00:32:21,720
today if you want to do a machine run in

713
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,789
the darkest eyeshadow what do you need

714
00:32:23,789 --> 00:32:25,919
to do well you need to load the data

715
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,309
state divide the measurements couple of

716
00:32:29,309 --> 00:32:31,889
lines of code and for instance I show

717
00:32:31,889 --> 00:32:34,559
the code for support vector machines for

718
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,840
multi-layer festival and for read the

719
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:40,499
forest so attacks we need three months

720
00:32:40,499 --> 00:32:43,080
ago but five lines of proof so that

721
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,470
tells us people even without a lot of

722
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,600
knowledge about side channel amount

723
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,970
machinery can easily do attacks and

724
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,850
that's very nice part because we are

725
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:55,499
getting more and more people interest

726
00:32:55,499 --> 00:32:59,129
but we should not avoid the fact that we

727
00:32:59,129 --> 00:33:01,230
need also to know what is happening so

728
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:03,179
while it's good for us to be able to

729
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:05,759
copy and use the code we need to think

730
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:09,269
what the code does why is it good and I

731
00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:13,379
let me show you one more example today's

732
00:33:13,379 --> 00:33:15,149
was very simple machine learning

733
00:33:15,149 --> 00:33:16,529
techniques but

734
00:33:16,529 --> 00:33:17,059
even

735
00:33:17,059 --> 00:33:19,100
we go for something let's say little bit

736
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:22,549
more complicated so this is the full

737
00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:25,190
code you need for your deep learning

738
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:27,230
attack in chaos

739
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,960
fine you can make your network bigger

740
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,700
you can make this you can make that

741
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,190
actually this code even cost several

742
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:37,490
different networks so hundred fifty

743
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,679
hundred sixty lines of code you come to

744
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,440
full attack to come to very efficient

745
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,480
attacks in here we have the here and

746
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,909
example even something that was

747
00:33:46,909 --> 00:33:50,749
relatively fast I write it on a laptop

748
00:33:50,749 --> 00:33:53,809
that does not have any any GPU so it's

749
00:33:53,809 --> 00:33:55,909
just well description

750
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:59,749
it's just infographic path and even with

751
00:33:59,749 --> 00:34:04,610
Rusty's and it's a convolution so we can

752
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:07,839
see that we can do powerful attacks

753
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:11,089
there not a lot of knowledge coding laws

754
00:34:11,089 --> 00:34:14,030
or even very specifically and this is

755
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:16,550
nice because it gives us all opportunity

756
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:19,699
to learn and to do more stuff but we

757
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:22,040
always need to be careful why are we

758
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:26,089
doing something to have good motivation

759
00:34:26,089 --> 00:34:29,119
to have good intuition how does it make

760
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:39,739
sense and this is perfect timing sipping

761
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:40,819
thank you very much for your

762
00:34:40,819 --> 00:34:43,668
presentation yes now it's time for Q&A

763
00:34:43,668 --> 00:34:46,510
you can open if you open your chat

764
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:51,168
function then everybody please feel free

765
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:53,629
to send your questions to stiffen in the

766
00:34:53,629 --> 00:34:56,119
chat and he'll be able to answer right

767
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:59,720
now want us to open source frameworks

768
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,160
for machine learning deep learning

769
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,740
against a channel that we can try on

770
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:07,010
available data tools so from dataset

771
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:11,359
side there I know five or six publicly

772
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,760
available data sets I would recommend

773
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,630
checking any of the latest papers

774
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,619
published on our some of the top

775
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:20,060
conferences like chess

776
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,310
commonly people will write links there

777
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,410
for all those deficits so those would be

778
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:28,130
something like oscar DPN before areas

779
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,680
are the area stage and

780
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,520
chessy yep from HS 2018 competition that

781
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,330
race could be this is what people mostly

782
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:39,920
open source framework for machine

783
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,390
learning I do not know any framework

784
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:49,460
really for this why well I I believe the

785
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:52,520
biggest reason is it's very simple to do

786
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,980
side channel with machine learning so

787
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:59,260
people did not really big big framers I

788
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:02,240
I know for instance my group is now

789
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,940
building a framework hopefully it will

790
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:07,160
go out in couple of months then there

791
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,760
will be something but currently many of

792
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,420
the papers do publish their own

793
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,800
architectures so if you go for instance

794
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,290
on the Oscar page you will not find all

795
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:20,750
the data sets you will also find very

796
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,490
nice smarter than your place at thrown

797
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:25,310
in very nice comma Lucian network but

798
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:27,140
really a framework framework in the big

799
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,840
picture I do not know for side channel

800
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:33,620
with machine learning people what

801
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,900
performs better still name or our names

802
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:39,200
so CNN is coalition or network her name

803
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,870
is recurrent Alanna port this is very

804
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:45,910
good question and tricky one because

805
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:48,710
currently the answer is very simple CNN

806
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:51,680
without a question so all the results we

807
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,610
have publicly available indicate that

808
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:57,770
CNN works great and unfortunately

809
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:00,380
Ireland does not work at all or works

810
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:03,310
terrible that and this is in a way quite

811
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:05,930
counterintuitive because we one would

812
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:08,150
say well what is our structural measure

813
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:11,180
with some time series something from the

814
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,190
oscilloscope and our lens because of

815
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,860
their occurrence they should work quite

816
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,530
nicely with time series but it does not

817
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,480
seem to be like that and it seems that

818
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,970
the problem is the recurrence technique

819
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:25,580
usually takes two small periods to take

820
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,710
all the important information but

821
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:31,550
currently our lens seems not to be

822
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:34,370
strong option in such animals

823
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:37,010
I must say from the other side that

824
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:39,500
there are not many available results I'm

825
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:43,580
aware one or two papers in general even

826
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,600
try our

827
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,110
so we do have how many results maybe we

828
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,940
do not have more results because people

829
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:53,030
tried and did not succeed but what is

830
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:57,620
available he did not work right you

831
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,450
deeply help with five three or four

832
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:01,550
higher clock frequencies rather than

833
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:04,340
lower frequency microcontrollers I see

834
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,140
lots of processing and noise in more

835
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,970
than songs well this is very good

836
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:12,490
question I would I don't say a copious

837
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:15,050
but this is this is extremely good

838
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:17,600
question because we do really see that

839
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,260
leave from academic perspective our

840
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,870
indistinct of thinking well machine and

841
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,220
deployment works great

842
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,040
our results are amazing but when we talk

843
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,580
with people from practice from industry

844
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,780
commonly you will get quite a lot that

845
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,090
they say well honestly this doesn't

846
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:37,670
really work in practice then do a

847
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:41,420
difficult target it doesn't work and now

848
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:46,700
the question is why so I hope I hope I I

849
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,950
would like to say that I think and I

850
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:51,170
believe it will help but there is a big

851
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:54,790
big road up to to that point because

852
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:58,190
first we need to thin as as a community

853
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:01,190
data set with those measurements and all

854
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,020
again we can really do the attacks and

855
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,060
see how well is it work and improve and

856
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,980
improve and improve I would say from

857
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:12,110
first probably - not very good but I do

858
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:14,900
hope it's definitely doable maybe for

859
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,850
that those targets we will finally need

860
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:18,890
to go to real be planning big big

861
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:23,750
networks hopefully but I have hopes that

862
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:32,680
it super okay no more Christmas people

863
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:38,150
yes everyone this is your last chance to

864
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:40,340
asks different question for today the

865
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:50,630
last excellent question I was I was

866
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:52,820
chairing Europe that was

867
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:55,130
Mitchell held in Zagreb so I had a

868
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,660
dagger into the ground

869
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,800
so whoever counts

870
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,530
next year 2 euro clip if you help us in

871
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:02,810
video yes let's go

872
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:05,870
then in Zagreb so this is actually the

873
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:08,990
view from the top top floor of the hotel

874
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,210
where we would have our reception party

875
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:13,580
so this is the view you can enjoy it

876
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:17,180
there getting okay

877
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,770
I lived there so maybe that's why I do

878
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:20,870
not appreciate it so much but yes I

879
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:23,180
heard it's beautiful at least for

880
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,690
tourists yes let's say it like that but

881
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:29,840
which nice book to study and one sleepy

882
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,000
even practiced over the security limits

883
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,460
of security in bed itself yes

884
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:39,230
so book wise there is not so much I must

885
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:42,020
be honest they're extremely nice book to

886
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:46,700
start is the blue book so revealing the

887
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:51,290
secrets of smart cards but that's 2007

888
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:53,330
that book does not have anything

889
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:56,570
specific for machinery so I would say

890
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:58,370
the best reference for really

891
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:00,590
state-of-the-art results is checking

892
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:03,170
checking the two savings from one of the

893
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:06,620
top conferences like I don't know chess

894
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:10,670
or more dark if it's little bit more on

895
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,830
the hardware side or date or something

896
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:15,040
like that

897
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,890
any particular good countermeasure

898
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:22,730
against machine learning VP a very good

899
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,360
question

900
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:27,950
from several people it does not seem so

901
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:33,170
that there is much done up to now we are

902
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:35,060
still in the setting like I said the

903
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,850
problem is that that academia versus

904
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:39,800
practice between academia I think we are

905
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,200
already crazy successful but people in

906
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,640
English they think well here are not so

907
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:47,810
crazy successfully in top results so the

908
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:52,190
question is I do not even know which

909
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:54,020
state of the art countermeasures that

910
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:57,200
are commonly used on targets that are

911
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,270
commonly used that would be very easily

912
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:02,750
breakable anyway but I do not know any

913
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,630
of very specific results going for

914
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:08,510
something very very much against machine

915
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:11,860
learning the one paper and noise

916
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,890
to use the process you could use a noise

917
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:17,420
that makes up with several examples

918
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,490
because of the server example is

919
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:21,680
something that makes machine learning

920
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,570
something so if you can make a

921
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:27,610
countermeasure that produces noise that

922
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:30,740
pushes examples to become a receiver

923
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,660
examples that could be very interesting

924
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,790
combination the biggest problem with

925
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:37,190
something like this is in practice it

926
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:39,080
should be very difficult to make a

927
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:42,560
countermeasure that behaves like but

928
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,080
that would be one very let's say exotic

929
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:49,790
in cool direction to go on McAfee I'm

930
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:51,980
bit concerned about the publish result

931
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:54,770
in some papers due to the nature it's

932
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:57,740
hard to make results can you comment on

933
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,810
this or have your solution I complete

934
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:02,990
that we there is a big problem with that

935
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:06,020
and unfortunately commonly many people

936
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:09,050
to her very simple answer that is in my

937
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:10,280
opinion very wrong

938
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,350
why because they say well we are

939
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:14,480
structural people we are not machine

940
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,030
learning people so it'll be imprecise

941
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:19,760
machine run inside it should be

942
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,070
tolerated because it's not our paper and

943
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:26,480
they indeed many of the results are very

944
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,700
difficult to recreate and that is a

945
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,310
problem it covers the community but this

946
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:33,290
is also the problem that we recognize as

947
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:35,000
the community and we are working to

948
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,390
improve but the best simplest solution

949
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:41,330
is really what many people are doing

950
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:43,730
they do publish their best architectures

951
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:46,520
so you can down find quite a lot of

952
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:49,490
machine learning models online or at

953
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:51,620
least architectures if not before models

954
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:54,410
and then it's quite trivial to reuse

955
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:56,450
that code and see how I do not get the

956
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:59,210
same result then there must be something

957
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:02,300
very strange so I would say the current

958
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:05,360
best solution is for people to really do

959
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,120
offer their their architectures online

960
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:11,000
especially if people are claiming those

961
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,490
architectures are great then it's very

962
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:15,830
nice to share it with other researchers

963
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:18,950
that we can also use it in exploring I'm

964
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:22,210
very very grateful to

965
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:24,790
people behind us guarding some elective

966
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:26,950
papers they really published their

967
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:29,380
architectures and I do news don't like

968
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,000
it that you see many experiments because

969
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,250
it's very natural to use it they you

970
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:35,470
then you know for sure what you use is

971
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:39,490
one day the spot any it was about your

972
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:41,349
traits collection measurement setup in

973
00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:47,500
fact if you have tried so about exactly

974
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:51,220
what so for deeply before it's a

975
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,170
software implementation mask

976
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:55,599
implementation that is that has some

977
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,130
problems so it's basically a mask

978
00:44:57,130 --> 00:45:01,810
implementation so it's a s 128 I do not

979
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:06,190
remember more details ADHD is FPGA

980
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:10,720
implementation with very low signal to

981
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:15,760
noise ratio without countermeasures yes

982
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,869
Rd is software implementation random

983
00:45:19,869 --> 00:45:22,440
delay in Phillip and ask that is again

984
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:27,910
software with masking and so I do not

985
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:30,310
talk about the setups there because none

986
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:32,560
of those data sits among so I did not

987
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,650
really do the acquisition the results I

988
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:37,570
showed you for portability so the

989
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:42,060
difference is there are done bit ABR and

990
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:48,060
the setup is so iam measurements several

991
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:50,830
oscilloscopes in parallel all doing the

992
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:53,190
measurements at the same time the

993
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:56,589
oscilloscopes lacroix the iam probes

994
00:45:56,589 --> 00:46:02,380
were larger and for more details I would

995
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:05,109
recommend send me a mail and I will I

996
00:46:05,109 --> 00:46:09,460
will give you exact links with all

997
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:11,770
details because I do not remember all

998
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:13,750
the details about the measurement setup

999
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:21,400
honestly what should be good there are

1000
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,550
many muscles many measurement methods so

1001
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:27,099
perfect for a doctor or perfect for

1002
00:46:27,099 --> 00:46:28,750
designer let's say perfect for the

1003
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:33,190
attacker first before attacker means no

1004
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:36,070
countermeasures and very nice example

1005
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:38,110
but let's say perfect for evaluate and

1006
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:40,420
perfect for us as researchers I would

1007
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:45,000
say that the amazing set that would be

1008
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,180
the same algorithm which is 128 just

1009
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:52,720
made it simpler done in portability

1010
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:56,050
settings so two different devices with

1011
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:58,540
and without countermeasures or

1012
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,730
countermeasure all countermeasure off

1013
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:04,150
because that gives us a lot actions good

1014
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:06,340
smore because if you wanna play it one

1015
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:08,710
device you take measurements for one

1016
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:10,600
device if you wanna do portability you

1017
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,900
have to have make calculation without

1018
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:16,960
calculation countermeasure wise I would

1019
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,800
recommend to have well this is a lot of

1020
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,380
work but unfortunately we need we need a

1021
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,660
strong masking countermeasure and we

1022
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,850
need a strong hiding countermeasure and

1023
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:29,530
then we would need a second without

1024
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:32,830
countermeasure only hiding only masking

1025
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:35,830
and ideally even both because we wanna

1026
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:38,110
see what are the limits currently we do

1027
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:39,900
not know what to do limits are different

1028
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,670
we think deep learning is great and very

1029
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:46,900
savety because what we do is to see so I

1030
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:50,110
would say but there is not a single

1031
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:52,480
person taken see what would be perfect

1032
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,160
is actually to have quite a lot of

1033
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,820
measurements that do come learn to be

1034
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:00,190
small differences between each other so

1035
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:02,770
that we can really evaluate the effect

1036
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:04,240
of something small

1037
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,460
okay what's the effect of portability

1038
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:07,660
well I can do that

1039
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:10,690
only for how exact setting portability

1040
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:12,730
what's the effect of masking or if I

1041
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:14,650
found everything fixed and then only

1042
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:17,770
mask all off so it's quite a lot to work

1043
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:23,620
and currently I would say I do think

1044
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:26,800
that masking countermeasures do give

1045
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,460
better stronger results than hiding it

1046
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:32,740
seems all the hiding is also not very

1047
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:35,950
explored so I would say this is the

1048
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:38,380
direction that seems more interesting

1049
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:40,480
interesting for people to live

1050
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,380
but anything would be very helpful we

1051
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,240
are so limited with what we have but

1052
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,229
anything will be

1053
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:52,749
okay I think we're getting to the end of

1054
00:48:52,749 --> 00:48:54,819
the session so maybe time for one more

1055
00:48:54,819 --> 00:48:56,380
question if you have one more question

1056
00:48:56,380 --> 00:49:10,630
and then we'll finish that was a perfect

1057
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:12,729
timing then thank you very much stepan

1058
00:49:12,729 --> 00:49:15,519
for your presentation and for the

1059
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:18,009
questions what was to have you at

1060
00:49:18,009 --> 00:49:21,219
hardware i/o and that we hope to see you

1061
00:49:21,219 --> 00:49:30,819
in future editions as well message to

1062
00:49:30,819 --> 00:49:33,369
all the people I covered only small

1063
00:49:33,369 --> 00:49:35,799
parts so if you are interested in any of

1064
00:49:35,799 --> 00:49:39,430
these you come by mail do send me mail I

1065
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:42,699
will do my best place for you two papers

1066
00:49:42,699 --> 00:49:45,279
the data sets to do architectures

1067
00:49:45,279 --> 00:49:47,769
I will do my best to help if I can so

1068
00:49:47,769 --> 00:49:53,680
just right then let's blast off great so

1069
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,290
feel free if you have any more questions
