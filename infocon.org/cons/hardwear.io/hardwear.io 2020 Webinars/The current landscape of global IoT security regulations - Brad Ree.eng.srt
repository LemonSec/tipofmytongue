00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,309
hi everyone welcome to hardware eye

3
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:14,610
webinar today we are also streaming on

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,970
YouTube in addition to our zoom webinar

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,760
and please welcome our speaker for today

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,300
a Bradbury Brad will present the current

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,980
landscape of global IT security

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,680
regulations and he will talk about the

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,330
continued in fragmentation and

10
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,369
surprising approaches taken by some

11
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:37,440
countries and Brad is a CTO of IO XT in

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,930
this role he leads the ixt security

13
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,300
products supporting the IO XT alia

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,570
alliance and he is highly versed in many

15
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,969
IT protocols and their associated

16
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:51,750
security models so the presentation will

17
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,270
take around 20-30 minutes and they will

18
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,430
have a questions at the end so please

19
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,469
feel free to send to Brad any questions

20
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:00,629
in the chat and he will answer them

21
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:04,860
after his presentation so Brad now stage

22
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,510
is yours you can start your presentation

23
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,740
all right well good morning everyone

24
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,280
here we go

25
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,240
so I'd like to sort of start out the IU

26
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,670
XE alliance where basically the global

27
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,430
standard for IOT security but what we

28
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,790
really are is two hundred two hundred

29
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,220
over two hundred device manufacturers

30
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,460
retailers basically the ecosystems

31
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,700
network operators and and service

32
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,040
providers all really working to address

33
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,970
consumer security concerns what we

34
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,579
really did was we develop a IOT security

35
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,439
standard based a lot on what we were

36
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,200
seeing happening out in the global

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,649
regulatory markets but then also what

38
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:54,869
are our board companies and and such are

39
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:57,869
using in their own ecosystems and the

40
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:59,909
core thing that we did was we developed

41
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:02,549
a testable and scalable security

42
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,659
standard that really applies from light

43
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,598
bulbs to set-top boxes the cars and cell

44
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,450
phones now the reason for all of that is

45
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,950
really sort of

46
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,050
talk about what's happening in the

47
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,150
regulatory space and you'll see sort of

48
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,090
why industry went in this direction but

49
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,370
let's you know start out with a little

50
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,500
bit of you know back to the future and

51
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,640
where this all began so you know the the

52
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,340
real shot that went across all the

53
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,190
bowels of the governments were the Mirai

54
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,760
botnet attacked back in 2016 so you know

55
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,770
a couple of interesting facts is sort of

56
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,300
looking back through this write quite a

57
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,010
bit of stuff was really written on this

58
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,160
but the interesting thing about this

59
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,800
attack was really it ended up being only

60
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,910
about 23 different manufacturers so you

61
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,500
know it just happened that this 23

62
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,959
manufacturers had a whole lot of volume

63
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,630
and could really go and you'll drive a

64
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,200
lot of chaos out there the interesting

65
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,480
thing about that though is prior to

66
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,940
their attack what they what they were

67
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,350
trying to do was they wanted to hide

68
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,330
their activities so they actually

69
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,760
released the source code into github and

70
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,079
then soon after went and it launched the

71
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:21,810
attack was also sort of interesting just

72
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,459
literally last night I did another

73
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:25,890
search on github keep in mind this isn't

74
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,380
a terribly scientific approach but

75
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,220
there's now 850 repositories that

76
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,829
contain some form of Mirai and even the

77
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:36,750
the rate of growth really surprised me I

78
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,970
had recently looked at this back in

79
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,970
November and there was only about 600 so

80
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,880
people are still using this framework

81
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,250
replicating it and expanding so this is

82
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,030
really the the seminal activity that

83
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,280
woke up a lot of governments and said

84
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,200
you know we should really start doing

85
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,470
something about IOT security yeah here

86
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,720
we go so just back it up a little bit

87
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,750
right so you know the Mirai attack for

88
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,690
those who weren't where was really

89
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:08,340
Japanese give a name for the future and

90
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,019
everything so means a little bit more

91
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:12,000
now that I got my screen share and I

92
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,029
thank you so much so this here is what

93
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:20,600
we really see happening in the US for

94
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,010
regulations and what I want to really

95
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,419
focus on was the

96
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:27,580
the fragmentation here if you take a

97
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,199
look you got States going to the left

98
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,969
and you know the federal government

99
00:04:30,969 --> 00:04:32,469
going to the right everyone's trying to

100
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:35,560
do their own things but as a result of

101
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,289
the mere I attack California was one of

102
00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:41,830
the first states actually go and and get

103
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:45,039
a get a law in the books now the

104
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:48,189
California bill was sort of interesting

105
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:51,279
on its surface it tried to do a pretty

106
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:53,289
decent thing it just said no

107
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:56,409
pre-programmed passwords so you know or

108
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:57,969
at least if there is a pre-programmed

109
00:04:57,969 --> 00:05:00,849
password on the on the first login you

110
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:02,830
have to change so that that would

111
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,909
actually make it you're pretty

112
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:05,860
straightforward however where they

113
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,590
started getting into more interesting

114
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,960
troubled waters is they added the clause

115
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,990
reasonable security so you know the

116
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,669
challenge with reasonable security of

117
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:18,819
course is what is reasonable and at this

118
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,979
time when this went through there were

119
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:23,289
no federal guidelines nothing from this

120
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:25,469
nothing really too terribly published

121
00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:28,240
you know there are a couple Federal

122
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,729
Trade Commission actions that were taken

123
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:32,529
against some people that people were

124
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:36,879
looking at but this this is for anyone

125
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:39,339
here in the United States state bill 327

126
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,310
it's sort of the big call to action as

127
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,979
we got to be a little bit more careful

128
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:47,379
and and help try to define these

129
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:50,889
reasonable security things now what's

130
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:53,080
interesting for those who may be in

131
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,000
other countries you know the United

132
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,729
States has this regional you know state

133
00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:00,669
versus the federal kind of thing what's

134
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:02,560
interesting with the state is once one

135
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,899
state does something well then another

136
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:07,270
state tends to pick it on up or again

137
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,310
being right next to California just sort

138
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,110
of looked look to the south and said hey

139
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,789
that that looks like an interesting

140
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,879
thing but then they went and expanded it

141
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:19,180
so what we really see is you know this

142
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,009
example of they they follow through with

143
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:23,379
the same your pre-programmed passwords

144
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:25,960
added you know the same reasonable

145
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,419
security issue but then they even went a

146
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:30,009
little bit further talked about you know

147
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:33,189
generation of new means and then sort of

148
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:36,550
a half step backwards where unlike

149
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,440
California where you know this law is

150
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,190
going to be

151
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,310
in California Oregon said this law is

152
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,390
here unless there's a federal regulation

153
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:48,340
now another couple of interesting things

154
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,960
that came out of Oregon versus

155
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,690
California was Oregon went and and

156
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,600
started defining a little bit more the

157
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,380
type of devices so you see down here and

158
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,600
a what they really did was they said

159
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,320
these IOT devices were born target just

160
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,080
personal used so this isn't per se

161
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,970
commercial or things like that

162
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,310
the other interesting thing that they

163
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,490
did though is expanded from just talking

164
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,420
about internet protocols to any other

165
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,670
address and included the indirect

166
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,340
communications so these things start

167
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,160
pulling in other protocols like ZigBee

168
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,890
and z-wave and things like that that sit

169
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:34,060
behind the Gateway so the challenge here

170
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,450
though is with 50 states each of these

171
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,610
states started doing different things we

172
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:42,160
see continued fragmentation just as a

173
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,400
little key here the the bullets here

174
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,560
with dark lines around them have all

175
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,230
been enacted the dash lines are still

176
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,360
being discussed and everything and we

177
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,970
see things like in Virginia now they're

178
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,590
going even further and saying the

179
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,660
password should have you know so many

180
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,060
characters so many numbers things like

181
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,330
this you know from an IOT standpoint

182
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,970
this becomes rather troublesome when if

183
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,730
you're trying to you know ship a

184
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,930
connected light bulb and it's going to

185
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,669
Mississippi and it has to have a you

186
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:15,910
know 15 character password versus going

187
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,820
to Minnesota and it has to have 15 plus

188
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,220
special characters so these are the kind

189
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,160
of things that really have us concern

190
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,250
now on the flip side Congress finally

191
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,160
started taking a look at this but for

192
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,979
those who follow politics in the United

193
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,740
States here we've got a very fragmented

194
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,679
very politicized environment so sure

195
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,719
enough Congress couldn't just settle on

196
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,590
one idea they watch two different

197
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,720
potential bills now neither of these

198
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,420
bills have been enacted yet they've gone

199
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,060
through committee more on the IOT and

200
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,730
Monaca which really is just sort of a

201
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,310
half-step forward this act was really

202
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,320
meant to say anything that the

203
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,450
government purchases must meet these

204
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,150
security requirements but in the United

205
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,950
States this gets to be a bit of a

206
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,380
slippery slope when you look at how much

207
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,020
stimulus money goes into things like

208
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,210
solar panels and things like that and

209
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:17,720
exactly where this would be applied now

210
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,460
what we also see with a lot of these

211
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,800
early regulations and as they've moved

212
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,440
so in the early regulations as I

213
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,240
mentioned things like Virginia is saying

214
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,910
how many characters in a password the

215
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,580
original IOT Improvement Act had a very

216
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,130
similar thing they explicitly call out

217
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:37,490
in the the bill what kind of security

218
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,320
features had to be there

219
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,140
now the real challenge there is you know

220
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,910
think about it if we barely can get

221
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,430
anything through Congress do you want to

222
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:50,000
have to go get a bill passed to change

223
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,970
the length of a password so instead what

224
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,830
has really happened is the latest

225
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,810
version of the IOT Improvement Act

226
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:59,330
basically said security guidelines

227
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:02,870
should be followed from nest so thus

228
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,630
we've seen the latest movement here NIST

229
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,900
IR a two five nine which I'll get to in

230
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,150
a second they went and they tried to

231
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,880
define what security should look like

232
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,240
for consumer and commercial products the

233
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,820
interesting thing with NIST is NIST is

234
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,220
not a regulatory body they're just a

235
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,470
standards organization typically their

236
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:27,410
stuff is written as best practices and

237
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:30,500
such so even looping back to sort of my

238
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,630
opening statement about the iOS the

239
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,970
Alliance and that testability this is

240
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,650
one of the things that we actually see

241
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,570
as a challenge coming out of this

242
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,520
approach is when you write a best

243
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,130
practice it's not necessarily a testable

244
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:46,339
standard but let's take a look at an S

245
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:48,830
stuff so on its surface

246
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:52,790
NIST really settled into six core items

247
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,880
device identification protection of the

248
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,160
data software updates you know

249
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,050
configuration protection of the

250
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,990
interfaces and then a cyber state

251
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05,690
awareness now what's interesting is if

252
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,610
you look at what's

253
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,860
in this side versus the European side

254
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,480
when we get over to the European side

255
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,670
you see that beast who don't necessarily

256
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:16,990
line up which does cause some issues for

257
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,420
any one ship being globally and

258
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,420
everything but the other thing that I'd

259
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,670
like to sort of point out so this this

260
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:28,690
the NIST IRA 259 was published just last

261
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,510
week there's a couple of these items in

262
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:34,420
here that are concerning and I I

263
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,579
definitely would recommend folks taking

264
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:39,790
a look at things like that device

265
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:43,870
identification so clearly pinning device

266
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,899
identity when a when a product enters a

267
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:49,089
network right you have to build a route

268
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:51,430
of trust and all this that's important

269
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:54,160
but on the flip side should every single

270
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,190
consumer product have a unique logical

271
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:00,010
identifier so these are some of the kind

272
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,800
of concerns from a data privacy you know

273
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,019
even thinking I'm looking at GD P R and

274
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:06,820
some of these other things if every

275
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,320
single device has these unique

276
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,079
identifiers and if they become immutable

277
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:13,680
what does that mean in the long term

278
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,019
another couple things that are sort of

279
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:20,970
surprising in this in a 259 is

280
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,860
requirements here that the cryptographic

281
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,430
keys can actually be adjusted by

282
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:32,170
authorized entities so you know that and

283
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:35,740
along with the ability to do software

284
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:40,029
rollback those two things would be

285
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:42,370
concerning for for most folks running

286
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,829
large ecosystems and everything right

287
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:46,680
typically rollback attacks are

288
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,860
definitely you know an attack vector

289
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,329
anyone who can downgrade a key length

290
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:53,920
and that's you know we've seen those

291
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,720
kind of issues come on up in some of the

292
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,029
latest Bluetooth attacks and things like

293
00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:01,779
that so I just want to caution you know

294
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:03,970
those who are tracking this - absolutely

295
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,250
watch for some of these kind of things

296
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,550
and you know encourage encourage change

297
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:12,910
where possible the good news with this

298
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:16,180
is this is not per se a regulation these

299
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,370
are still just best practices or

300
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,350
guidelines

301
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,850
so flipping over to Europe Europe we see

302
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,730
things a little bit cleaner there seems

303
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:30,310
to be less of the fragmentation between

304
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,410
at least you know the local countries in

305
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,550
the European Union

306
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,250
essentially the path that we see

307
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,740
happening and the dominant regulation

308
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,460
that's come out is the en 303 six four

309
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,610
five that really traces its heritage

310
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,280
back to the iot code of practice that

311
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,750
the UK government put out through their

312
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,210
Department of digital culture media or

313
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,390
sport or as they like to call themselves

314
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,450
or the department of fun so these guys

315
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,100
are right if you think about why would

316
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,500
it's the sport group we looking at IOT

317
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,540
security well really it comes down to

318
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,790
digital rights management through the

319
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,980
the media and broadcast protection so

320
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,170
that that's the heritage of where that

321
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,080
group started but what they really did

322
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,960
was they they came up with their 13 core

323
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,950
principles and from these 13 core this

324
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:28,000
is what went in to en 303 6 4 5 these

325
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,330
mostly stayed intact but like any

326
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,820
committee work once once things got

327
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,790
started they quickly expanded I think

328
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,220
the last time I looked at this I think

329
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,680
it's about 60 different sub elements

330
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,490
here at its core what we see is the

331
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,400
three primary things no default password

332
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,690
a vulnerability disclosure program and

333
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:55,840
having devices as upgradable as a matter

334
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,960
of fact in the UK right now there's been

335
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,270
some announcements that they plan to

336
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:05,080
introduce into Parliament some kind of

337
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,310
regulation enforcing these three items

338
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:11,860
so I said on a surface this all looks

339
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,560
great some of the challenges though on a

340
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,860
global nature is first and foremost what

341
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,050
you really see between the u.s. approach

342
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,180
or I should say the North American

343
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,550
approach and the European approach is in

344
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,530
the European side there's a little bit

345
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:29,230
more of a consumer focused along with

346
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:32,410
data protection so things you know very

347
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,500
much reading on

348
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,930
gdpr where you've got to be able to make

349
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,630
it easy to delete personal data along

350
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,990
with ensuring that the data is protected

351
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,330
like I say on its surface that's that's

352
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,520
all good but then there's some other

353
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,930
things as you get into some of the

354
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:51,160
details where companies are going to

355
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,800
actually be asked to disclose what

356
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,320
sensors are in their devices what data

357
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,250
is in the telemetry information you know

358
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,800
things that get to be a little bit more

359
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,110
difficult especially if you've got deep

360
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:10,100
supply chains and everything another set

361
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,340
of features of this that Elise is just

362
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:17,210
some caution here is the scalability of

363
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,610
some of these so you know we all know

364
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:22,100
that validating implicated super

365
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,890
critical to do but in practice and in

366
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:28,520
scale how do we verify all of the IOT

367
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,580
devices meet these kind of things you

368
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,890
know even even things like minimizing

369
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:36,500
attack surface once again that's that's

370
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,900
definitely very good security best

371
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,510
practices but then as you look at it

372
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:44,360
from a testability how does that happen

373
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:50,720
in practice and in scale so flip it on

374
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,470
over to Japan Japan last year took a

375
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:57,140
really different approach to the problem

376
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,200
so essentially what they've got is in

377
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,330
the build-up to the Olympics they were

378
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,640
very concerned about what was happening

379
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,500
in the network they were concerned about

380
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,189
a mass botnet attack and so the approach

381
00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:12,619
that they really took was instead of

382
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:15,140
encouraging change or regulating the

383
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,119
devices that went out they almost took

384
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,810
more of a policing approach so what they

385
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:23,630
did was they they gave some of their

386
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:26,000
agencies the permission to scan

387
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,420
everyone's network so anything that was

388
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,750
in your home and publicly connected they

389
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,810
would scan against the known username

390
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:38,330
and passwords then where this gets to be

391
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,010
sort of interesting is they would do the

392
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:42,470
scans they reach out to the Internet

393
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,870
service providers the Internet service

394
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,910
providers would tell the consumers that

395
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:47,270
they

396
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,520
have a device in their home that appears

397
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,040
to be hackable and then also there would

398
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,650
be support to help people work through

399
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:58,640
this so this made the news pretty big

400
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,350
when it first got announced what's

401
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,030
rather interesting just sort of looking

402
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,820
through where they're at the first six

403
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,300
months of this project I I forget the

404
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,250
exact number but it was tens of millions

405
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,770
of devices were scanned and what was

406
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:15,230
rather interesting about this was about

407
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:18,800
a hundred and fifty notices per day went

408
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,460
to the the carriers and the ISPs so it

409
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,650
wasn't an insanely large number but a

410
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,960
hundred and fifty devices per day when

411
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,670
there's something like cameras and

412
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:31,550
set-top boxes and DVRs you know these

413
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,800
kind of things can really sort of pile

414
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:38,570
up and wreak havoc on the network now in

415
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:41,830
practice what's sort of interesting is

416
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,990
this year is and luckily I believe I

417
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,600
removed all the account information this

418
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,320
was a similar thing that that AT&T had

419
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,190
sent over to my dad a couple years ago

420
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:58,100
very similar AT&T detecting something in

421
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,070
the network but you know I question when

422
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,470
you send something like this to a

423
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:07,370
consumer what actions do they can they

424
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,860
take right are they are they empowered

425
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,350
to actually take action here so no I I

426
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,360
had gone and visited my dad and he

427
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,010
pulled out this email and said hey I

428
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:19,040
received this you know AT&T says

429
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,990
something in my house has been taken

430
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:24,500
over but what is it and my first comment

431
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,320
as I read through this is I said well

432
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,570
dad you you received this in October he

433
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:33,220
goes yeah and I go well it's it's June

434
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:36,380
did you do anything and it is kind of it

435
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,700
was well I didn't know what to do so I

436
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,380
just filed it away until I could talk to

437
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,280
you in person and see what's going on so

438
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,960
though the the policing approach is

439
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,270
interesting the real challenge to any

440
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,220
kind of consumer especially with any

441
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,070
amount of equipment in the home is what

442
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:57,800
exact actions can you take so pulling

443
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,290
back up to at least where the iox

444
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,010
Tijuana

445
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:04,190
really took this so what we did was we

446
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,900
looked at what's happening in those

447
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,780
regulatory bodies we still see some

448
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:11,870
pretty large philosophical shifts

449
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:14,860
between the policing approach of Japan

450
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,900
consumer centric approach of Europe and

451
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,140
more of the minimalist device centric

452
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,750
approach of Europe and really tried to

453
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,510
build a set of standards that sort of

454
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,990
weaves between those until we can see

455
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:33,320
some consolidation around there so the

456
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,410
the core message here is there's still a

457
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:39,980
lot of work to be done I'll back up here

458
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,970
to the latest area that we see is we do

459
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:46,670
see the current fight for global

460
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,310
regulations has actually been moved up

461
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,620
to ISO I think that's where we're

462
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:55,280
probably going to finally see North

463
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,040
America and Europe come together it's

464
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,050
still a little bit unclear on what kind

465
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,000
of enforcement we're going to see out of

466
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,180
that but I do hold hope that and Leeson

467
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,340
ISO is a national I'm sorry an

468
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,830
international organization that is

469
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,380
really at least set up for this but I I

470
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,810
still am holding my breath to see

471
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:21,970
exactly where this lands so with that I

472
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:27,760
like to open it up for any questions I

473
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,900
think I'm supposed to look in a chat

474
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,750
window right yes thank you very much for

475
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,030
your presentation yes gonna open the

476
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:38,930
chat window and yeah people can send the

477
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,060
questions over there let's give them a

478
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:47,420
few moments to type it in sure thing and

479
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,940
as a as two people are thinking that

480
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,400
everything yes I you know I I do

481
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,710
question the approach of you know

482
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:57,320
sending grandparents email address or

483
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,110
emails that talked about an IP in your

484
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,690
home has been hacked it's like that bad

485
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:05,000
email I love to just say because it's

486
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,890
one of those wonderful actions like what

487
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:12,740
do you do about that right so got a

488
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,240
question here

489
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,630
how are startups and large manufacturers

490
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:19,070
digesting different standards and then

491
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,770
what is working for them and what are

492
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:25,030
their concerns with respect to these so

493
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:28,310
there is a a challenge for the startups

494
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:31,850
for sure you know at least I'll give it

495
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,130
a little bit of a pitch once again for

496
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,500
what the iOS the Alliance is is we do

497
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:40,310
see unfortunately the regulatory game is

498
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:43,220
is mostly a large corporation game

499
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,550
obviously the meetings are open

500
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:49,220
happening all around but it is a little

501
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:52,130
time consuming to you know spend time in

502
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:57,710
London and in DC and especially with all

503
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:01,070
the travel constraints but anyone can

504
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,350
attend these meetings it just takes some

505
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:06,190
time what we do see is large

506
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,630
manufacturers typically already have

507
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,820
their own security standards so what we

508
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,460
see is quite a bit of positioning of

509
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,120
making sure that the regulations fix the

510
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,760
minimum bar and don't go too terribly

511
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,430
far so from a start-up standpoint that

512
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:24,590
would of course be a very big concern is

513
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,810
if the bars raised too high does this

514
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:29,180
add too much time and cost to their

515
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,030
products and then what is working for

516
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,280
them and what are their concerns so the

517
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,500
the biggest concern that the

518
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,920
manufacturers who we talked to is

519
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,230
essentially the fragmentation so if

520
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,840
you're building a device and it needs to

521
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,590
be sold

522
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,890
you know globally just dealing with all

523
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,630
the different plug types is a big enough

524
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:53,060
challenge but if each especially in the

525
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,040
United States if there are 50 different

526
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,430
IOT regulations that is a real big

527
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:01,370
problem for companies to scale the other

528
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:04,220
thing that we see is as all the

529
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,560
organizations started we all agreed at

530
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,110
the high level but as we start working

531
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,120
down into the details you start to see

532
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,090
some drifts in different directions so

533
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:16,880
really as of today both the North

534
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,110
American and European standards are a

535
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:23,330
challenge they don't align in the same

536
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,640
direction so that would be the the

537
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,950
biggest concern that I see from everyone

538
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:35,330
and yes I'm sorry I didn't mean to laugh

539
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:36,919
on this one is there a regular

540
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:38,870
regulation that states oh that

541
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,820
cryptographic operation should be done

542
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:43,010
using dedicated hardware accelerators or

543
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:45,530
would a certified software

544
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,780
implementation suffice I'm sorry where I

545
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,210
thought that was is even on standard

546
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,250
based cryptography is a challenge

547
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:55,010
internationally you'll see that some of

548
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:57,860
the curves that that were pushed in

549
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:01,000
different countries aren't universally

550
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,490
recognized what we do see though is yeah

551
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:06,409
should dedicated hardware accelerators

552
00:25:06,409 --> 00:25:09,860
be used for the most part everyone's

553
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,650
leaning towards that that's where we

554
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:15,080
should go one of the biggest challenges

555
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,840
and even in the iOS D Alliance we had

556
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,710
this discussion around should secure

557
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,870
boot based on Hardware root a trusty

558
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:26,539
baseline and the core problem that we

559
00:25:26,539 --> 00:25:30,669
have with this is hardware root of trust

560
00:25:30,669 --> 00:25:34,159
processors and dedicated hardware

561
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,470
accelerators aren't universally

562
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:40,580
available in all these small CB radios

563
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,640
and in the the little tiny sensors that

564
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,010
have to run off coin cell batteries for

565
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:48,590
ten years so this is this is where the

566
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,539
real balance I think most people have

567
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:53,120
multiple levels and they're encouraging

568
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,590
folks to go to hardware base

569
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,780
accelerators but when you look at all

570
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:00,710
the all the things in that IOT it's it's

571
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:03,200
a real big swath to go from the set-top

572
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,270
box all the way down to the lowly light

573
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,760
bulb and it's the light bulb and these

574
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,970
low end products that are concerning to

575
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:18,169
set that bar there all right all right

576
00:26:18,169 --> 00:26:21,500
well I definitely appreciate being

577
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,990
invited on and able to talk to everyone

578
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:27,289
you know if there's any other questions

579
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:30,070
you know feel free to reach on out and

580
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:33,500
you know I I love to talk about all this

581
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,530
fun security issues thanks a lot yeah

582
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,909
thank you very much again for your

583
00:26:37,909 --> 00:26:41,470
presentation it was really interesting

584
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,050
you

585
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:48,299
