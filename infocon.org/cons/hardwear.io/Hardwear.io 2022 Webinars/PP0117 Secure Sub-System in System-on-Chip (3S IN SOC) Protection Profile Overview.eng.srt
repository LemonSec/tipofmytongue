00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,640
protection profile overview

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,280
um now i would like to invite you to

24

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,600
certification so i will present

27
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,479
the

28
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,439
work which was done which was led

29
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,000
by me in eurosmart a

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,360
the

31
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,759
3s in soc protection profile

32
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,759
overview

33
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,080
okay

34
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,040
next okay it's working

35
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,240
great

36
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,280
so

37
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,520
in the last year we see more and more a

38
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,439
solution of integrated

39
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,720
secure a advanced secure functions

40
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,360
in a system on chips and the mcus

41
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,680
in particular it's very common to

42
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,600
integrate secure element

43
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,159
which is known as the highest security

44
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,960
level a

45
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,439
product

46
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,159
for a ics and

47
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,040
also we see more and more interest in

48
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,520
integrating the hsn

49
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,160
to the sock

50
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,239
but the

51
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,040
the major adoption barrier

52
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,040
for those integration is the lack of

53
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,400
protection profile which describes

54
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,959
what are the exact requirement

55
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,400
uh to protect those high um high-level

56
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,280
security requirement in an integrated

57
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,800
solution

58
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,400
and in many cases most of the a

59
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,120
soccer mcu's vendor are not the

60
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,280
traditional secure element a

61
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,840
industry or market and there are

62
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,400
there there is lack of knowledge of the

63
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,519
security

64
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,959
requirements that need to be fulfilled

65
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,840
so eurosmart took the challenge and

66
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,400
established the secure subsystem in

67
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,080
stock protection

68
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,080
protection profile subgroup

69
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,360
for developing this protection profile

70
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,200
the group

71
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,400
includes

72
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,680
a

73
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,760
representative from the industry from

74
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,640
the develop the developers from the lab

75
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,920
the itself

76
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,879
a certification body were invited

77
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,440
uh so basically we cover all the the

78
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,760
the bodies that are involved in the in

79
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,920
both in in the

80
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,400
sponsoring the evaluation and holding

81
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,720
the assessment and the certificate

82
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,080
so

83
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,080
before we talk about the protection

84
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,799
profile just a little bit of reminding

85
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,640
or explanation what is protection

86
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,519
profile and protection profile

87
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,680
is first of all is used part of the

88
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,519
common criteria

89
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,840
a process the iso 15408

90
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,480
and this specified generic security

91
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,120
evaluation criteria a

92
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,360
for the vendor to prove the claim of

93
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,000
security for a family of

94
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,840
a product

95
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,840
it's very important to understand the

96
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,200
protection profile doesn't define a

97
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,199
specific implementation

98
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,160
or

99
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,279
how to do it it's only guidance for the

100
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,240
general security requirements that need

101
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,880
to be fulfilled the way of

102
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,600
how to do it is the responsibility of

103
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,280
the vendor

104
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,479
and the protection profile itself is a

105
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,800
combination of threats

106
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,040
uh that need to be

107
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,960
that were analyzed

108
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,600
for the family of the products

109
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,400
a

110
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,199
security objectives assumptions security

111
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,320
functional uh requirement this safaris

112
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,360
and

113
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,479
once all those requirements are set we

114
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,720
also include a the security assuming

115
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,520
assurance requirement which means how in

116
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,240
we and which aspect need to be assessed

117
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,120
for making sure that the claim of the

118
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,840
developer is indeed

119
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,360
correct

120
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,120
another dimension of the protection

121
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,440
profile is the evaluation assurance

122
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,000
level which means in which level of

123
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,520
security this product family

124
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,680
need to meet

125
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,039
so uh

126
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,240
the levels are from one to seven

127
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,360
uh

128
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,880
typically high level insurance is five

129
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,759
uh

130
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,960
and

131
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,000
all

132
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,320
these activities are being

133
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,720
in most of the cases are being

134
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,320
initiated and

135
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,720
created by the community

136
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,960
by the stakeholders of this

137
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,080
a product family or or the specific

138
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,759
solution

139
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,360
as was done for pp117

140
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,160
as i mentioned it was a group of

141
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,880
developers labs and certification bodies

142
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,280
and about pp117 what was the objectives

143
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,560
first of all

144
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,280
to develop protection profile for secure

145
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,080
subsystem in sock

146
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,039
second the objective was

147
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,560
to have strict conformance to

148
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,720
the well-known security asset protection

149
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,280
profile pp11884

150
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,520
which is the

151
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,039
the

152
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,880
the well-known secure element protection

153
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,000
profile

154
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,039
and the

155
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,280
this objective was highly critical for

156
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,479
our work

157
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,479
to provide the developer the capability

158
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,120
uh to claim for compliance to pp84

159
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,440
according to different a

160
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,840
protection profiles without

161
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,199
without

162
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,759
doubling the the certification which

163
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,360
means that

164
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,800
that if in

165
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,199
in another protection profile there is a

166
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,199
reference to pp

167
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,880
0 0 4

168
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,160
84

169
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,280
the

170
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,919
the developer can do the 117 but and it

171
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,319
still has three conformance to this

172
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,080
production profile

173
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,199
also the pp target is el4 plus which is

174
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,639
the same as pp

175
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,080
84 with the lcd vs2

176
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,680
and

177
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,919
80 dpt and van 5. in addition we add the

178
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,280
fluorimentation

179
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,720
cflar.2 which is a ucc

180
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,199
a cybersecurity european cyber security

181
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,039
act requirement

182
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:37,840
uh

183
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,639
so now we also make sure that we are in

184
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,880
line with the

185
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,680
with the cyber security act

186
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,759
on top of it we

187
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,160
have we include support for external

188
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,360
memories

189
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,479
till now

190
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,960
the solution didn't include the usage of

191
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,080
external volatile memory in a secure

192
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,199
devices so we support this architecture

193
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,240
which is

194
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,440
the most popular for a socks

195
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,840
we add optional packages for software

196
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,960
loading and update recovery provisioning

197
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,680
composite software isolation and we kept

198
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,000
the crypto package as was in pp84

199
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,639
and we make sure that this protection

200
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,520
profile is in line with the

201
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,720
a

202
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,960
uh with the groups

203
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,160
outside the

204
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,919
external to your smart as the

205
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:34,159
gssgsmida developed the eucc and the

206
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,640
fido

207
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,839
and let's speak a little bit about the

208
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,919
target of evaluation

209
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,040
as i mentioned before uh we are talking

210
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,920
about security subsystem the security

211
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,040
subsystem as you can see at the right

212
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,720
is integrated in a system of chips

213
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,040
that have interfaces

214
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,640
to the system on chip and also a in most

215
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,760
of the cases we'll use externally

216
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,360
nvm

217
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,160
non-volatile memory

218
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,720
we define a range of security

219
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,399
it includes

220
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,320
several security functionality

221
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,519
to

222
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,160
address the security objectives

223
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,240
and

224
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,720
the isolation is one of the important

225
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,720
topics that they

226
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,160
were fulfilled

227
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,920
and were addressed

228
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,399
because of the need of a

229
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,640
avoiding leakage of information from the

230
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,440
secure subsystem to the stock and the

231
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,360
outside

232
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,760
and

233
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,760
as i mentioned before in most of the

234
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,519
cases external and non-volatile memory

235
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,240
or

236
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,080
volatile memory will be used

237
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,680
so

238
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,920
the structure of the of the protection

239
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,640
profile starting from the base pp which

240
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,920
are the the mandatory uh security

241
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,920
functions that they

242
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,560
need the developer need to meet for

243
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,720
being able to claim

244
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,040
for a compliance to this protection

245
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,560
profile

246
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,760
on top of it we have a

247
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,240
the dedicated security function for

248
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,000
external memory

249
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,720
for a crypto library usage

250
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,399
a for a

251
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,920
composite software a isolation if it if

252
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,640
it's a part of the target of evaluation

253
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,160
and the loader

254
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,399
in many of the cases composite software

255
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,600
isolate

256
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,839
composite software isolation and lo and

257
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,440
loader we will

258
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,680
arrive we will come together

259
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,720
this is the certified v1

260
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,920
version

261
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,360
uh we

262
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,800
plan to to develop actually the next

263
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,640
month additional packages to to make the

264
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,399
the production profile

265
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,000
uh

266
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,760
comprehensive and

267
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,480
that meets all the the requirements in

268
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,680
the industry

269
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,399
which the the packages are the updater

270
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,760
the recovery and the provisioning that

271
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,480
we expect that in many

272
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,880
market segments it will be required

273
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,480
okay

274
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,040
about the threads uh that

275
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,800
we address

276
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,560
uh i won't go into details because uh

277
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,440
the ones that under that know pp84 know

278
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,760
most of the the threads that are

279
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,040
mentioned the others just i want to give

280
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,440
you the impression of what are the

281
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,760
content of this protection profile

282
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,440
so the great part is the part that is a

283
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,440
discrete compliance

284
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,360
to a

285
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,279
pp-84

286
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,560
which are the

287
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,519
general security functions for a leakage

288
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,920
and the physical probing and the

289
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,160
physical manipulation

290
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,360
and the abuse function and and also the

291
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,560
randomly

292
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,440
the

293
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,519
crypto threads is the trnd

294
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,279
we add a additional set of threads that

295
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,639
they are

296
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,360
in line with the stock architecture

297
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,839
which are first of all the threats

298
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,800
related to the use of external

299
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,920
memory

300
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,600
is the

301
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,360
in the main context of use the clone

302
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,279
replace

303
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,839
the replay

304
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,720
thread and the rollback and also the

305
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,680
insecure state and the views and as you

306
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,440
can see

307
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,760
in the traditional secure element

308
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,480
architecture of internal memory embedded

309
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,839
the flash

310
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,760
uh

311
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,040
there are there is a new uh a thread

312
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,839
that need to fulfill so it means that

313
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:02,560
the

314
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,160
pp84

315
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,639
according to our analysis it's not

316
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,480
sufficient to to

317
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,600
describe all the threads that are a for

318
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,760
the sock and also we have a set of

319
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,920
threads which are related to the use of

320
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,040
a

321
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,639
of a external memory

322
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,639
and now nero will explain about the

323
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,000
methodology

324
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,920
okay so um hi so as rachel mentioned um

325
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,880
there was a need to uh redefine

326
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,199
uh the protection profile so that it can

327
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,480
be used

328
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,440
in the case where a secure subsystem or

329
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,760
a hardware security module or a secure

330
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,839
element is integrated into another

331
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,880
silicon of a more sophisticated system

332
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,920
on a chip

333
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,760
and one of the main uh

334
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,600
drives for uh

335
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,440
generating a dedicated protection

336
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,959
profile

337
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,120
is that there is a need to reuse

338
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,079
uh this certification in order to have

339
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,320
the same hardware security module

340
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,760
implementation

341
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,600
uh integrated into more than one soc

342
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,800
okay because we know that socs have a

343
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,600
newer generations as the years go by

344
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,680
whereas the security functionality

345
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,519
remains basically the same

346
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,399
be that a secure element implementing a

347
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,519
payment applications or

348
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,440
sim card uicc

349
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,360
or hardware security modules

350
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,440
this security functionality basically

351
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,920
stays the same all the time and the socs

352
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,760
continue to grow and evolve but if you

353
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,480
want to integrate this kind of uh

354
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,199
security functionality we need to make

355
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,800
sure that it can be reused from

356
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,199
generation to generation without tasking

357
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,440
the soc vendor with having to go through

358
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,360
the same certification process again and

359
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,720
again

360
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,279
so one of the main um

361
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,079
uh

362
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,160
let's say uh tests of the pp117

363
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,240
is to ensure that this reuse can be uh

364
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,959
done

365
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,120
easily so

366
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,560
that pp117 includes um also the

367
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,560
provisions for doing the rail

368
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,000
certification and reusing the

369
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,680
certification from generation to

370
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,120
generation so

371
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,160
once

372
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,199
a vendor submits the soc and the secure

373
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,480
subsystem for lab evaluation

374
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,959
they also request for an evaluation test

375
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,199
report for integration in etr for

376
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,120
integration which is a document that

377
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,199
describes what needs to be done

378
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,079
when this certified

379
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,839
subsystem

380
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,680
is being integrated in the next

381
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,959
generation of the soc

382
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,759
okay this document identifies what are

383
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,839
the boundaries of the

384
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,600
target of evaluation the secure

385
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,320
subsystem in terms of the soc and how it

386
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,480
should be reused in the next generations

387
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,240
if we take the basic uh or the classic

388
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,000
situation where a vendor takes an soc

389
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,959
adds some secure subsystems and takes it

390
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,279
to certification

391
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,120
this soc

392
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,720
in many cases

393
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,759
uses an external uh

394
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,240
non-volatile memory to hold the user

395
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,399
code and data for the secure subs for

396
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,240
the soc sorry um can be a smartphone or

397
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,480
whatever and there is also always a

398
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,000
pleasure of

399
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,440
storage space

400
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,160
and this external storage space

401
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,279
uh sometimes is used to hold also

402
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,160
the secure subsystem code and data

403
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,120
so we have the soc we have a flash

404
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,800
interface for the external standard

405
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,199
flash out of the soc

406
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,279
and this entire

407
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,680
soc with the secure subsystems using

408
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,399
pp117 guidelines go to certification

409
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,120
process it's being certified

410
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,800
but then

411
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,679
once the new generation of the soc is

412
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,119
being designed and sometimes

413
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,959
modifications to the flash interface

414
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,559
must be done because the functionality

415
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,799
of the soc changes the type of external

416
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,319
flash changes

417
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,799
uh we know that there is always a move

418
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,959
for faster higher capacity flash devices

419
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,240
socs have uh more functionality more

420
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,760
cores sometimes they need more

421
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,839
interfaces so

422
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,880
when the an soc goes through a change

423
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,679
that also changes the flash interface

424
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,039
it uh

425
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,440
devoids the existing certification

426
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,320
because

427
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,799
in under these circumstances the

428
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,960
existing certification of the secure

429
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,280
subsystem cannot be carried on it needs

430
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,880
to be uh reevaluated by the lab because

431
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,520
some interfaces that involve the secure

432
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,200
subsystem have changed

433
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,840
in other cases there is a way to carry

434
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,919
on this certification from generation to

435
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,080
generation by uh using a secure flash um

436
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,559
in combination with the secure subsystem

437
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,640
we know that most socs

438
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,640
um can uh

439
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,200
hold or implement a lot of

440
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,000
uh volatile memory ram memory inside but

441
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,120
there is uh very very little options to

442
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,400
incorporate

443
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,000
non-volatile memory

444
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,440
and with uh

445
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,559
the most advanced process nodes uh below

446
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,400
15 nanometers

447
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,640
and non-volatile memory cannot be

448
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,360
implemented in the soc die so there is

449
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,919
always a need for an external secured

450
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,760
external storage sorry

451
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,080
and another option is using a secure

452
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,600
flash in combination with the secure

453
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,799
subsystem

454
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,640
a secure flash is a

455
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,280
flash memory that has been certified

456
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,039
according to a

457
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,360
required protection profile

458
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,440
and this secure flash

459
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,679
uh along with the secure subsystem is

460
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,840
going through the certification process

461
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,880
of what we call a composite

462
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,400
certification where

463
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,799
the certification of phone component and

464
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,320
another component

465
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,880
are evaluated together

466
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,679
and to ensure that the complete product

467
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,840
as we see here in the dashed red line is

468
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,520
also certified

469
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,679
as a target of evaluation

470
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,240
now once this is certified because all

471
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,880
the interfaces are inside the target of

472
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,960
evaluation yeah they are between the

473
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,039
secure subsystem and the flash the

474
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,720
secure flash

475
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,400
this configuration

476
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,320
can easily be taken from

477
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,880
one soc design to another soc design

478
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,080
because in terms of evaluation nothing

479
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,440
has changed

480
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,600
in the secure subsystem it remains

481
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,480
exactly the same

482
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,520
so

483
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,280
what does pp117 means in practice

484
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,640
so

485
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,400
as rachel mentioned there are a lot of

486
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,640
vendors involved in the creation of this

487
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,240
protection profile but there are many

488
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,440
more vendors

489
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,360
that are looking into this protection

490
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,520
profile right now

491
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,679
i can say that i think

492
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,200
99

493
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,720
of tier 1 and 2 vendors are uh

494
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,640
really evaluating

495
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,880
pp117 and the impact

496
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,240
on their soc design right now because as

497
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,000
rachel said once ppe117 is out

498
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,880
there is no way to evaluate an soc with

499
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,600
secure subsystem just using pp0084

500
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,240
we have the industry has moved on to a

501
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,200
more elaborated more detailed protection

502
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,360
profile much more suiting

503
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,960
the needs of advanced soc designs

504
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,159
so

505
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,039
an soc designer that wants to integrate

506
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,880
a secure subsystem into their soc design

507
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,799
for all the good reasons of cost

508
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,480
reduction space reduction power

509
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,600
reduction

510
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,480
and opening up for more capabilities in

511
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,679
the soc

512
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,400
required to look into pp117 and

513
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,880
understand the impact

514
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,919
okay

515
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,159
now some designs up to use

516
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,559
regular standard external non-volatile

517
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,000
memory

518
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,760
and that will require some complex

519
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,520
security mechanisms to be implemented

520
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,520
these days so see i will go through them

521
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,000
in a minute

522
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,280
but

523
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,679
meeting uh the requirement of vp117

524
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,320
and also trying to share that

525
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,720
non-volatile storage with other soc

526
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,080
functions

527
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,480
which seems to be uh

528
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,559
somewhat of a given

529
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,320
uh requirement

530
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,280
uh

531
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,880
means that there is a lot of attention

532
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,120
that needs to go into the detailed

533
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,360
design of these interfaces to make sure

534
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,080
that security is not

535
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,400
breached in any way by sharing the same

536
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,720
storage between a secure subsystem and

537
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,000
standard soc functionality

538
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,520
so what's the main difference between

539
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,760
pp84 based secure element or uicc

540
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,880
and

541
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,880
integrating the 3s into an soc

542
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,640
so as i said

543
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,320
the storage

544
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,559
needs to be out of the soc boundaries

545
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,159
and when i mean out of this the

546
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,200
boundaries

547
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,559
even if it's an integrated or sorry a

548
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,480
stacked die or a multi-chip module

549
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,159
inside one package

550
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,440
in terms of pp117 it means that the

551
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,280
devices are separate because it's very

552
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,039
easy to uncap

553
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,240
an soc

554
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,720
and access whatever is inside

555
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,280
so once we take the um

556
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,799
soc

557
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,960
and the subsystem the secure subsystem

558
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,880
and the memory and they are in two

559
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,039
different devices

560
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,600
there needs to be a lot of attention on

561
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,720
how the data is protected

562
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,840
so the data should be protected from

563
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,000
content abuse replacement replay and

564
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,919
rollback

565
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,320
okay content abuse means that

566
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,240
someone that is not authorized to access

567
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,640
the data it could be a

568
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,679
an adversary that is opening up the uh

569
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,000
smartphone or whatever device it is it

570
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,240
can also be a piece of software that is

571
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,600
capable of

572
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,200
somehow

573
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,159
reaching

574
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,039
these

575
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,559
protected areas in the memory device and

576
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,039
reading them and trying to decipher

577
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,280
what's stored in them so that's content

578
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,559
abuse that's one thing that should be

579
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,039
mitigated another one is replacement or

580
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,320
erasure

581
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,880
of this data without the

582
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,440
security subsystem being aware of those

583
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,720
changes this is also a major risk

584
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,720
because it allows someone to modify the

585
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,120
content of the secure subsystem be that

586
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,760
the code or the user data

587
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,600
and these two

588
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,400
threats can be easily mitigated by

589
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,720
using strong encryption

590
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,799
and authentication so if you encrypt the

591
00:23:58,799 --> 00:23:59,919
data

592
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,840
it's not possible for someone else to

593
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,480
use it read it abuse it if you add

594
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,640
authentication replacement will be

595
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,279
easily detected by the secure subsystem

596
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,520
but there are two more attacks

597
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,440
which are must be considered according

598
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,679
to pp117 which are replay and rollback

599
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,520
replay means that

600
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,120
because the

601
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,840
storage and the main soc are in

602
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,600
different packages

603
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,320
there is a way to somehow

604
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,080
interfere with the communication between

605
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,960
them

606
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,000
and record the commands going

607
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,559
one way or the other and play them back

608
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,520
later on to try and to

609
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,159
turn the soc or the memory into a

610
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,559
previous state okay suppose you have

611
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,320
some uh let's say credentials stored in

612
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,600
the device

613
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,159
and you record how they were modified

614
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,760
and they are modified again you can

615
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,080
maybe somehow go back in time so to

616
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,279
speak

617
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,000
and

618
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,760
abuse the

619
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,080
interface between the two devices to

620
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,880
modify the content of the flash or

621
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,880
somehow uh make the soc uh believe that

622
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,480
is

623
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,880
using a different content that is what

624
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,799
is stored in the flash i did at that

625
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:15,919
time

626
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,360
rollback is another attack

627
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,400
which uh in which the adversary the

628
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,520
attacker

629
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,760
tries to put all

630
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,919
out of date information into the flash

631
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,840
but this information is

632
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,840
also um

633
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,279
cryptographically protected and

634
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,000
authenticated because it was an original

635
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,520
information that has been stored there

636
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,120
in the past

637
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,960
and trying to roll back the system to a

638
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,200
previous state using uh

639
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,760
such attacks because if you have a

640
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,640
standard flash memory you can take it

641
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,400
out of the system you can read it you

642
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,360
can reprogram it it should it's easily

643
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,240
done

644
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,320
and if you are able to reprogram the

645
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,200
device with older content which is uh

646
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,159
encrypted and authenticated using the

647
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,320
correct keys of the system you'll be

648
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,760
able to rollback the system to previous

649
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,919
state which is very very very uh

650
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,400
unwanted and it's considered a security

651
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,360
breach in order to counter this rollback

652
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,360
and replay

653
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,360
pp117 adds

654
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,000
what we call an irreversibility inquiry

655
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,559
which is in essence a monotonic counter

656
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:23,919
it means that every operation that

657
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,640
modifies the content of the flash

658
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,880
also increments this irreversibility

659
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,960
anchor this monotonic counter

660
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,320
and all the encryption and

661
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,120
authentication that is being done

662
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,120
also uses the value of this monotonic

663
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,400
counter to make sure

664
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,600
that the content is always

665
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,600
encrypted and authenticated with a

666
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,000
different value this value is only known

667
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,400
to the soc and the flash device or only

668
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,840
to the soc but this enables the secure

669
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,520
subsystem to ensure that the content

670
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,400
inside the flash is up to date and is

671
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,000
authentic

672
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,600
and has not been modified in any way

673
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,320
so

674
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,159
as i said there are two options of using

675
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,720
an external memory one is using a

676
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,039
standard flash as i've described and the

677
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,840
other is using a certified secure flash

678
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,039
to meet pp117 requirements

679
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,799
what are the benefits of using certified

680
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,279
secure memory

681
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,200
certified security handles all these

682
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,000
tasks of encryption authentication

683
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,360
replay protection and worldwide

684
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,640
protection

685
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,600
it contains the irreversibility anchor

686
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,399
aka the monotonic counter inside the

687
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,200
flash device because to implement such a

688
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,679
monotonic counter inside an soc

689
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,840
requires a lot of

690
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,320
otp space which is sometimes not visible

691
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,600
in an soc and if it is feasible it will

692
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,080
carry a very hefty price tag

693
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,399
for the silicon size

694
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,760
it allows a very simple reuse of the toe

695
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,840
in new designs since the secure flash is

696
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,360
part of the toe

697
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,760
and there are no interfaces for other uh

698
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,919
elements of the soc to access the

699
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,720
content of the non-volatile memory

700
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,760
and

701
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,080
it minimize the overall certification

702
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,399
effort

703
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,559
so

704
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,720
a simple ver very simple block diagram

705
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,240
of a secure subsystem inside the soc you

706
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,000
will have your cryptographic

707
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,480
functionality the small cpu that is

708
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,279
part of the secure subsystem and it

709
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,880
refers to the external flash and the

710
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,440
certified secure flash and all this

711
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,679
dotted uh dashed line

712
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,240
is being certified and can be reused

713
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,760
again and again again in future

714
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,880
generations of the soc or in many socs

715
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,120
from the same vendor because

716
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,360
in essence this doe never changes it

717
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,200
stays and remains the same throughout

718
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,159
the generations of the device

719
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,080
so to summarize

720
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,399
um

721
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,799
the secure subsystem including the

722
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,360
secure flash interface is implemented as

723
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,360
a closed block within the sock the pp117

724
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,039
paves the way for

725
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,320
integration

726
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,200
of

727
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,679
certifiable secure functions into modern

728
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,440
socs

729
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,240
it allows simple reuse of the secure

730
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,840
subsystems in many soc designs

731
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,559
and when using a certified secure flash

732
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:31,840
with a

733
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,240
secure subsystem

734
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,080
the user or the designer gains the

735
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,279
benefit of

736
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:42,480
having a reusable simply reusable uh s3s

737
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,480
component that can be used in many soc

738
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,080
designs again again with a very very uh

739
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,480
[Music]

740
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,279
limited certification effort for

741
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,679
further generations

742
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,360
and now it's time for q a

743
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,200
thank you very much for the presentation

744
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,279
i would like to encourage everyone who

745
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,600
have who has any questions to write them

746
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,399
in the chat box

747
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,399
let's wait a little bit

748
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,399
sure

749
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,279
i do not yet see

750
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,200
any maybe people need some time to

751
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,080
digest uh what they heard today

752
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,000
so if they need to ask questions or

753
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,200
contacts in

754
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,679
on top of the webinar we they also can

755
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:40,799

760
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,120
any questions they can get back to you

761
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,200
later uh on this presentation

762
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,080
since

763
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,640
we don't have any uh questions

764
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,640
there is a question slice will be

765
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,760
available we have recorded the um the

766
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,000
session and the entire session with the

767
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,840
slides will be available on our youtube

768
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,399
channel in a few days time after we edit

769
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,320
the video

770
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,799
so they will be available

771
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,000
