00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,000
who is an assistant professor at the

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,840
university of florida

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,599
in today's presentation sara will

10
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,279
provide us with an overview of the

11
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,760
relevant scope vulnerabilities attacker

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,680
motivations and challenges to build

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,559
trustworthy intelligence systems

14
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,320
visara i would like to invite you to

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,280

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,280
you go i hope

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,079
everyone can see my slide

18
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,039
yes

19
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,160
perfect

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,360
thank you

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,680
so health andrew was like a kindly

22
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,079
introduced me uh i'm an assistant

23
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,480
professor at university of florida and

24
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,800
i'm also the member of the florida

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,920
institute of cyber security research

26
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,159
here in gainesville

27
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,200
and my research and my lab focus on

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,400
cyber physical system security so

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,759
let's start with the content so today

30
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,200
i will talk

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,280
mostly about

32
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,119
like what

33
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,360
are like the environmental physical

34
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,119
attacks in general and how

35
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,759
like transduction attack especially when

36
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,840
involved sensors

37
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,240
and the perception

38
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,360
system

39
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,320
they can be a health trend

40
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,759
in a certain way from attackers but also

41
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,600
some unexpected

42
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,960
signals

43
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,399
and how

44
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,560
like this can impact

45
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,000
decisions that are taking a high level

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,479
part of the system for our system

47
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,079
especially

48
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,799
when it comes from like a machine

49
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,240
learning based decision

50
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,719
so it is a combination of hardware and

51
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,800
software interaction

52
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,760
and uh definitely this

53
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,319
is a new challenge that uh

54
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,640
like not only my love about it like in

55
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,840
general this opened up a lot of new

56
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,000
opportunities to understand how hardware

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,280
and software interact to each other how

58
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,879
like the system

59
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,680
can be undermined by this interaction

60
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,480
and how we can fix this kind of issues

61
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,800
so

62
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,959
so usually when we talk about

63
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,800
like physical attacks

64
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,160
we

65
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,879
have the impression to have two major

66
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,319
categories so we always talk about

67
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,840
like these

68
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,680
two main families

69
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,720
one is like related to false injection

70
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,680
attacker and the other mostly related to

71
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,360
psychonaut attacks

72
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,040
so when we talk about the fault

73
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,840
injection attack we have this sort of

74
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,720
division by not invasive attacker and

75
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,879
like invisible attack

76
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:21,680
and

77
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,640
what uh what actually means is that we

78
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,319
try to inject

79
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,879
like high posted signals

80
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,840
or like we

81
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,640
use strong dmi signal or

82
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,440
like other powerful um

83
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,319
like optic signal for example laser beam

84
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,760
kind of beams

85
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,440
to

86
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,560
interfere with the electronic components

87
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,560
especially cheap

88
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,319
in this case

89
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,200
and

90
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,000
like the main principle is that we're

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,879
trying to induce errors

92
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,400
in like a digital domain for example uh

93
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,200
when we use glitches in voltage we are

94
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,120
trying to get the system mixed here

95
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,319
in their processes for example skipping

96
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,280
instruction entering loops

97
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,160
and the main goal of this kind of

98
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,079
attacks is to understand for example

99
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,600
if uh

100
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,080
like we can expect the secret key

101
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,880
encryption keys or a certain way we can

102
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,800
halter the behavior

103
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,759
and these invasive attacks uh

104
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,479
like especially also might have a

105
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,440
components like the capping the chip or

106
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,680
at least the probing and attaching like

107
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,759
in very physical like a very near

108
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,360
proximity of the device itself

109
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,720
to induce

110
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,919
like this kind of reaction from the

111
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,199
system

112
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,240
on the other way instead we have

113
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,720
like side channel attacks in this

114
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,759
internal like mostly uh we talk about

115
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,560
some sort of attack that are passive so

116
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,240
they perceive

117
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,960
uh like the behavior of the system by

118
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,479
observing the physical signals

119
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,800
like the power consumption but also

120
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,280
electromagnetic emission temperature

121
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,039
changes and based on the processes that

122
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,360
like the system and in this case it can

123
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,360
be a microcontroller

124
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,919
or like whatever chip

125
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,120
um it has been like a releasing into an

126
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,160
environment in this case like based on

127
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,800
this signal you can actually uh

128
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,680
understand what the system is doing and

129
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,400
try to destroy secret

130
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,880
so when we talk about these physical

131
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,000
attacks we're mostly like consider this

132
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,199
kind of two categories

133
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,680
but what happened is that

134
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,720
like we

135
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,880
are um

136
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,000
also

137
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,120
try to understand what happened like in

138
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,199
the middle between the two

139
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,080
when you are actually have a

140
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,880
like hardware components that can be

141
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,720
sensors or

142
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,639
like in general heavy electrical

143
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,919
components

144
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,680
that have an interaction with the

145
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,039
physical

146
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,800
environment

147
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,600
and

148
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,520
due to this

149
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,160
like interaction between the other

150
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,880
components and the physical domain

151
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,000
you can actually

152
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,039
make them perform different attacks

153
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,120
and you can use that to undermine the

154
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,080
system in a way less invasive that for

155
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,919
the injection attack

156
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,000
but also uh like halter the behavior to

157
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,560
follow what the attacker

158
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,000
wants to do

159
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,120
like the goal of the attacker without

160
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,000
the um

161
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,039
basically the system recognize that an

162
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,039
attack has been there

163
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,919
so some sort of active attack

164
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,240
with novel strong pin in the analog

165
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,919
domain so something not related to

166
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,360
like digital

167
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,840
uh data

168
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,160
so the first example of this type of

169
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,479
attacks are what

170
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,360
uh are called like usually transduction

171
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,000
and transduction attack this is just an

172
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,960
example that are related to the sensor

173
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,639
behavior

174
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,440
so these kind of attacks are directly

175
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,240
injection on the system

176
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,199
and

177
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,400
usually

178
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,120
what does it mean so if we

179
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,479
think about

180
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:43,759
like the

181
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,720
structure of a sensor we can recognize

182
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,080
basically three main parts

183
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,520
so first of all is the transducer itself

184
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,440
that capture

185
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,400
the

186
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,479
like environmental signal from the

187
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,319
physical domain

188
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,720
and then a sort of signal processing

189
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,160
chain

190
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,720
that alter the signal in a way that it

191
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,360
can be like measurable

192
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,520
and then we have like this conversion in

193
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,400
like the digital domain so it becomes

194
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,720
something that can be elaborated by a

195
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,800
cyber system

196
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,599
so

197
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,680
like this type of attacks

198
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,520
uh instead of liking using glitches

199
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,919
they try to like suddenly alter

200
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:32,958
what

201
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,760
like sensors but also like physical

202
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,719
components in general perceived from the

203
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,799
environment

204
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,519
to

205
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,159
like have some sort of

206
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,760
um

207
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,839
like consequences on the level of the

208
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,800
processor itself on the operation that

209
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,440
has been doing what has been captured

210
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,000
and what is perceived

211
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,160
so usually these external alterations

212
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,600
are done by an external physical signal

213
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,760
such as electromagnetic interference

214
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,279
sound or sunlight

215
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,480
mechanical vibration for example in the

216
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,640
magnetic field so this external

217
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,600
alteration can overcome the legitimacy

218
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,480
and they come from the environment

219
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,959
and uh like

220
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:23,839
if

221
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:24,720
um

222
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,440
particularly crafted by an attacker can

223
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,440
alter this kind of process and alter the

224
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,320
behavior of the system to induce

225
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,880
incorrect operation at the end that it

226
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,160
can be for example a system that having

227
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,080
correct measurement

228
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,040
uh

229
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,680
to like a more complicated system like

230
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,360
closed loop or autonomous system that

231
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,519
basically capture the operation and try

232
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,360
to compensate their operation to uh like

233
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,880
at the end

234
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,920
uh

235
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,240
for example being able to maintain the

236
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,519
temperature in a cabin

237
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,399
or

238
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,320
uh like the correct like level of

239
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,519
water flow in a tank

240
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,000
so what we have at the end is incorrect

241
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,760
operation due to this kind of attack

242
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,200
in the analog domain

243
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,000
so

244
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,640
when we talk about like this kind of

245
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,480
attack we

246
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,120
always think about the

247
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,519
like the perception and what kind of

248
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,680
hardware components

249
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,279
are

250
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,040
part of this kind of attack so we

251
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,320
can imagine the consequences and like

252
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,000
these

253
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,760
uh of this attack in a simple system

254
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,680
like as i mentioned before

255
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,680
incorrect measurement

256
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,880
but what we are doing nowadays is

257
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,600
something a little bit different

258
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,480
so

259
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,279
you might have noticed how this sensor

260
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,920
or maybe we are surrounded by sensor and

261
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,320
how this can perform more and more

262
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,839
complicated operation

263
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,640
and

264
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,040
the signal that this sensor capture are

265
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,360
using for like more complex uh

266
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,640
operation

267
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,079
in general and this hyperphysical system

268
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,880
has like have a lot

269
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,839
of

270
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,600
uh

271
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,200
application

272
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,160
and

273
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,760
like nowadays we can have for example

274
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,519
system

275
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,959
that

276
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,440
can monitoring like our heart beat

277
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,040
from distance

278
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,880
like inside a car

279
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,399
or we have

280
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,079
a like

281
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,560
smarter neighborhood than that

282
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,120
like a connected together

283
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,720
we can have

284
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,000
like iot device that can lead to your

285
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,200
brain

286
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,560
and maybe understand your thoughts

287
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,240
so this sensor

288
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,279
i become like an essential part

289
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,079
of like our normal interaction with

290
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,760
cyber system

291
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,720
more than what has been before

292
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,440
we have wearable device we have

293
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,000
something that actually interact with

294
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,279
our physical body and make automatic

295
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,720
operation

296
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,760
and all this kind of operation are done

297
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,800
without

298
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,680
the human supervision because they are

299
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,839
completely

300
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,240
automatic so these

301
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,120
hardware components that can be censored

302
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,279
or in general what is exposed with the

303
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,639
environment

304
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,680
become more and more capable of

305
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,639
things that we didn't imagine before

306
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,399
and go beyond like the digital domain uh

307
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,480
like traditional like in uh for example

308
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,519
computer system

309
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,680
one example of this that has been uh

310
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,440
like how for a while uh was how these

311
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,880
sensors are using in like safety

312
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,560
critical system

313
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,920
such as for example autonomous vehicles

314
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,480
autonomous vehicles perceive

315
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,040
the environment using sensors for

316
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,240
example

317
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,519
lidars cameras invaders

318
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,720
and try to like drive automatically the

319
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,959
car

320
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,160
and then how to do that

321
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,600
so they

322
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,000
capture the data but also elaborate

323
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,240
using with the machine learning

324
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,240
algorithm

325
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
so this kind

326
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,760
of algorithm

327
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,160
basically learn

328
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,760
from like the training data and they're

329
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,760
able to uh

330
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,000
like understand patterns they're like a

331
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,320
repeated pattern and that make a

332
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,480
decision among them

333
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,839
but we always see that like this kind of

334
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,959
perception can be like

335
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,600
i heavily affected by what the sense of

336
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,199
birthing

337
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,519
and like this machine learning algorithm

338
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,959
can also have some issues

339
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,760
so here there are two examples of what

340
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,800
happened in like a tesla automotive

341
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,079
system

342
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,680
for all using in front of one of those

343
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,959
vehicles

344
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:37,760
and

345
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,920
like we saw that usually like the

346
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,040
perception of the system can be like

347
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,920
unintended alternate normally like in

348
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,480
the normal behavior for example in this

349
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,639
first figure we can recognize that the

350
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,760
car

351
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,720
erroneously see a person that it was

352
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,480
actually

353
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,959
like an advertisement in the back of the

354
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,079
bus

355
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,320
in another example

356
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,800
uh tesla recognized for example a

357
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,880
traffic light

358
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,519
uh like a yellow traffic light but it

359
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,519
was in reality uh like just the sun and

360
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,560
also the moon was

361
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,440
so this kind of erroneous perception

362
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,320
normally can happen also like in the

363
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,760
most

364
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,320
like a dancing system

365
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,480
and it can be like a completely

366
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,360
unintended

367
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,519
but what it means

368
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,720
like when

369
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,959
we are trying to do that instead of

370
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:47,440
unintendedly like for real as an attack

371
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,800
from an attacker's perspective when we

372
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,279
talk about like in general attack a

373
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,959
transduction attack

374
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,440
or something that try to alter the

375
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,839
behavior of a system

376
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,040
using less like electronic components

377
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,639
and hardware

378
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,040
we can basically think about the two

379
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,360
main things

380
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,519
so one is that

381
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,240
these electronic components like no

382
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,320
matter what are affected by physical

383
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,920
phenomena

384
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,959
and

385
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,519
in the other way these sensor components

386
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,240
but also like any electrical components

387
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,360
perceive more than what

388
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,639
they are designed for

389
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,759
these two characteristics like together

390
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,959
or like separately can be exploited by

391
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:43,120
an attacker to alter the system behavior

392
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,800
so compared to like traditional security

393
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,079
when we try to attack hardware like

394
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,600
invasively

395
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,040
to maybe extract secret from like the

396
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,360
digital domain

397
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,600
and probably like

398
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,160
traditional security defense against

399
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,599
data are already in place on the system

400
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,880
so we can prevent this this kind of

401
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,880
attack are more subtle

402
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,240
because they can bypass this control

403
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,839
because the system actually doesn't know

404
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,720
is

405
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,599
like it's not able to distinguish what

406
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,240
is like a real and what is not

407
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,199
like for the tesla example uh like on

408
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,400
the top but if it was a projected

409
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,799
life figure of a man

410
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,120
the car was perceiving an active

411
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,520
normally detecting a people without

412
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,640
actually knowing if it was being uh like

413
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,919
haltered

414
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,440
intentionally by a manifestator

415
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,280
so when we have like a traditional

416
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,960
defense for example on the firmware

417
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,600
level well like um

418
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,640
system

419
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,280
operating system application like this

420
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,480
kind of attacks that can go and escalate

421
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,520
from like the hardware level until like

422
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,200
the automatic uh decision based from

423
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,200
like artificial intelligence system

424
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,360
so what we have is what is called an

425
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,160
integrity issue so we cannot recognize

426
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,080
or maybe the system itself but without

427
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,000
any help but cannot recognize what is

428
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,919
allegedly signal and what is not

429
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,760
so when we talk in particular about the

430
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,640
sensory exploitation what kind of of a

431
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,520
signal we can consider

432
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,400
so usually you exploit maybe the

433
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,640
attacker exploit

434
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,960
like physical characteristics

435
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,240
uh of like hardware components

436
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,039
and we can classify like these five

437
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,880
categories in general

438
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,679
so the attacker can exploit like the

439
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,760
company for example like a reference

440
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,760
frequency of certain components for

441
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,720
example inclusive vibration

442
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,559
this is a typical attack that involves

443
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,640
sound injection

444
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,000
you can induce vibration that maybe can

445
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,240
like cause or maybe the most simple

446
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,640
consequences is denial of service of

447
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,280
system but you can also like doing

448
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,880
suddenly

449
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,080
like change for alter classification of

450
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,559
the machine learning system

451
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,120
you can use non-linearities like a

452
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,679
rectification level of like little

453
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,320
components for like amplifiers

454
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,840
so you can

455
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,400
basically act

456
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,440
as a

457
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,679
like having a bias on the voltage that

458
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,600
is being measured

459
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,120
and using this bias to alter and maybe

460
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,320
transform a zero to 1 in digital domain

461
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,720
and vice versa

462
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,840
you can use also what is called

463
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,679
intermodulation distortion so

464
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,919
like when a signal passed through some

465
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,480
physical components or some medium like

466
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,799
in general it can hold slightly in air

467
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,480
for example but in very rare condition

468
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,360
you can naturally demodulate the signal

469
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,080
and the transformer for example some

470
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,280
sort of like light injection for example

471
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,360
in emi so you change the frequency

472
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,840
over your

473
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,840
signal another more simple way to

474
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,720
exploit this attacker is a sort of

475
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,960
periodicity and we will see an example

476
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,480
later on

477
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,840
and also over sensing so the fact that

478
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,240
as i mentioned before

479
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,400
certain components act

480
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,799
in different way for what we expect and

481
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,799
what we designed them to do

482
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,440
like for example i will show you how

483
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,600
men's

484
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,159
microphone can actually perceive light

485
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,320
as it was found

486
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,919
so this is just an example of what kind

487
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,039
of of

488
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,799
like

489
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,360
physical interaction of hardware has

490
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,120
and how you can exploit that to cause

491
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,360
problems in the like artificial

492
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,760
intelligence systems

493
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,400
so one of the examples that i want to

494
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,559
show here is what happened in voice

495
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,799
controllable system

496
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:15,679
so

497
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,320
we have when we're surrounding this kind

498
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,600
of devices and then usually like how

499
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,280
they simply works

500
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,120
so you have a microphone they perceive

501
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,760
our voice we have seen a processing that

502
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,240
basically cut down over

503
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,120
like a voice and execute commands

504
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,799
in based on speech recognition systems

505
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,840
very simple and we have iot device and

506
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,039
like device a variety connected to these

507
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,840
devices

508
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,159
so what we discovered in our lab is that

509
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,600
like

510
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,520
if you think about the structure of a

511
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,840
men's mic

512
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,159
it's like a

513
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,799
basically a diaphragm in a back plate

514
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,720
that will work like a parallel plate

515
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,400
capacitor

516
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,320
and then you have an acidic converter

517
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,880
that basically converts to the positive

518
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,520
changed voltage

519
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,840
here there is an example so it's very

520
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,640
simple and this was like an image from

521
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,080
some um

522
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,120
like smart speaker

523
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,760
so what happened is that we imagine that

524
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,840
microphone can capture only acoustic

525
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,400
waves because it make like the pressure

526
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,679
wave with this membrane and

527
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,600
like if this will change the capacitance

528
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
that is measured and then

529
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,960
you have

530
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,240
your

531
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,360
nice voltage interaction

532
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,360
but it's not true

533
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,960
so what happen is that the mems

534
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,960
microphone can also capture light

535
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,200
what does it mean

536
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,919
it means that if you change like the

537
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:54,880
light

538
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,840
and

539
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,520
like with the modulating um

540
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,840
modulating the current

541
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,080
of this laser beam

542
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,559
and like here

543
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,720
like him on the membrane

544
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,440
following a certain combination of

545
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,679
acoustic and photoelectric effect there

546
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,240
is our physics you can use the changing

547
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,840
capacitance that actually makes the

548
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,960
change that

549
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,640
a normal audio signal will provoke

550
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,840
so if you inject a sine wave

551
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,080
so if you change the current

552
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,440
of

553
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,880
like the laser

554
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,960
to follow a sine wave that will

555
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,320
correspond to a change in the microphone

556
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,919
signal

557
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,080
and these happen

558
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,000
because of the throttling the mems

559
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,440
structure

560
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,520
in several

561
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,039
microphone

562
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,679
so here we have like an oversizing

563
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,080
capability but how this changes on the

564
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,559
system

565
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,600
so

566
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,559
if i incorporate on

567
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,720
like these signals

568
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,640
an audio

569
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,919
signals

570
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,240
for example a commander okay google what

571
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,600
time is it

572
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,120
so i modulate the current of the laser

573
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,240
like follow this pattern

574
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,960
and i use that to inject it on like a

575
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,679
google home for example this will reply

576
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,200
so we actually did that

577
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,080
and

578
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,799
it's very simple setup that you can use

579
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,440
even a laser pointer to do it

580
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,480
like the one using for presentation

581
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,159
and with even like five millibars laser

582
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,360
power you can like induce answers to the

583
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,840
system

584
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,840
so we did a lot of experiment and adding

585
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,559
for

586
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,520
even like a telescope you you were here

587
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,919
or maybe we were able to inject like

588
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,000
comments more than 110 meters away from

589
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
like the victim the

590
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,640
system and we inject like in the port or

591
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,480
the microphone port because we need

592
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,760
something exposed to them

593
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,440
we also like attacking buildings here

594
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,240
and

595
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,320
like through glass windows because the

596
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,720
laser can actually like pass glass

597
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,799
windows without like any particular

598
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,120
restoration

599
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,440
so what we discover is that no matter

600
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,679
what kind of men's microphone we were

601
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,240
using all the systems were

602
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,080
affected by it

603
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,760
so the internal structure of the mems

604
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,799
microphone was not changing

605
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,120
like the function was not changing and

606
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,960
all were vulnerable

607
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,360
like in various degrees we attack like

608
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,120
smart speakers from google home to

609
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,720
ecosport but also to like

610
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,919
iphones and tablets for example

611
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,159
and we have several attacks arranged in

612
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,279
based on how difficult it was to inject

613
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,480
the laser beam

614
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,480
then for sure like based on that we try

615
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,640
to escalate to the attack

616
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,640
and try to understand if the system was

617
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,600
able to like get to our command

618
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,799
and

619
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,799
like attack the devices that were

620
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,520
connected to this mass speaker

621
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,279
and the nice thing so maybe we attack a

622
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,520
lot of things smart lock

623
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,000
like we make purchase we also being able

624
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,679
to start the engine of car

625
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,039
so

626
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,039
the nice things of it or maybe the nice

627
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,559
things are not for like for our

628
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,240
perspective but not for like the

629
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,960
manufacturer itself is that the system

630
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,919
itself like the signal processing part

631
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,559
in the must be learning was not actually

632
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,159
actually able to distinguish that it was

633
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,520
like a

634
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,279
sort of recording movies

635
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:02,480
and

636
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,120
dusty was acting as it was normal

637
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,440
we also attack a security camera we are

638
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,000
able to disable and enable the security

639
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,400
camera i also touch here the link so you

640
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,799
can see the demo videos of the attacker

641
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,200
with this account

642
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,200
for when we discovered the attacker to

643
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,120
the new generation of smart speakers

644
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,399
something has changed and uh like what

645
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,520
the manufacturer did hello maybe we

646
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,840
expected there might be a design choice

647
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,080
but we speculated that it might be also

648
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,320
due to our attack

649
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,120
like they covered the microphone port

650
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,120
so if you think about this the other

651
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,559
defense that they uh like implement

652
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,679
was a sort of

653
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:50,720
like

654
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,320
not allowed

655
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,799
like the part that were exposed to the

656
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,399
environment

657
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:57,760
the sensors

658
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,360
to be altered by uh like light in this

659
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,840
case

660
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:05,520
but

661
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,720
this was

662
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,720
a sort of

663
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,919
like not the optimal solution because

664
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,399
like after a while there was another

665
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:15,440
attack

666
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,600
they use intermodulation distortion that

667
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,840
is one of the characteristics that i

668
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,559
like explained before the hardware

669
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,279
to do exactly the same attack uh like

670
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,240
even if the microphone portal was

671
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,480
completely cool

672
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,080
that's why like electromagnetic

673
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,000
interference can pass through it like

674
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,240
attack the microphone then naturally

675
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,120
demodulate on the sensor level and so

676
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,080
you can likely basically inject the

677
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,840
commons on it

678
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,960
so

679
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,120
here we have like a vulnerability

680
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,279
combination and like the personalization

681
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,760
use it

682
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,320
to recognize the voice that is done by

683
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,880
machine learning algorithm

684
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,360
was kind of limited

685
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,399
and it was not accurate but at least

686
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,640
like this picture recognition resulted

687
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,000
like in the perfect layer to basically

688
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,840
interact with that

689
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,799
and be able to detect like our recording

690
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,240
voice

691
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,960
and also like this was also a

692
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,279
combination with other

693
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,600
like vulnerability in general

694
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,640
so for example like the wake up security

695
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,240
warden was only like recognized

696
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,039
by the system and not the entire command

697
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,240
so

698
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,960
upon that we have a lot of more like

699
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,679
characteristics

700
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,480
and also for the iot device we have like

701
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,880
the component and all the problem of iot

702
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,480
devices like

703
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,399
pin brute forcing

704
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:53,840
that we

705
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,440
like in place

706
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,240
and like voice recognition system

707
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,200
connected to like external iot were

708
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,440
vulnerable to this kind of

709
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,440
iot

710
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,679
the same for colors like not clear

711
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,320
proximity an official hack that we're

712
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,520
using

713
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,120
and uh like no key required another

714
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:24,320
security problem for executing operation

715
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,880
and this was like one of the

716
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,279
applications that how like machine

717
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,000
learning algorithm in general like in

718
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,880
combination with the like a cyber

719
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,200
physical system in hardware can be

720
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,600
affected by this attack another example

721
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,080
was a little bit complicated and it was

722
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,480
mostly related to advanced driver

723
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,320
assistance system and autonomous

724
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,679
vehicles

725
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,240
so usually like

726
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:52,680
these

727
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,000
[Music]

728
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,120
techniques are using for

729
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,360
taking partial and full automatic

730
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,159
control over critical driving processes

731
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,399
so like all the operation that you do

732
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,080
you capture like the amount of

733
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,159
environment and you deviate obstacles

734
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,799
for example

735
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:13,120
and

736
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,640
the thing is that

737
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,880
like if you think about

738
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,480
like a normal

739
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,919
what is called

740
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,919
other sudden learning attacks

741
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,440
the challenge is that

742
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,080
when you apply for example a patch in

743
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,399
the environment the machine learning

744
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,120
algorithm that is being not trained to

745
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,440
recognize this kind of of the

746
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,720
adversarial example

747
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,080
are affected by this

748
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,919
so we have these uh kind of of like the

749
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,559
from like several cameras uh

750
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,600
attack for example you have a patches in

751
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,960
the uh

752
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,799
cardboard that has been

753
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,080
like confused as a card for example or

754
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,200
you have 3d printer adversarial object

755
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,679
completely that can be

756
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,840
like they can fool and not have been

757
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,399
like classified by the machine learning

758
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:11,440
argument

759
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,399
but what was missing a cetera for the

760
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:18,480
application of the lidar for example

761
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,960
it was understanding

762
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,279
like what kind of physical iteration can

763
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,480
be used to affect

764
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,320
these kind of a machine learning

765
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,960
recognition

766
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,880
and what we did

767
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,440
was actually doing that

768
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,399
so

769
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,960
what we implemented was a sort of like

770
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,279
simple replay attack so the lidar system

771
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,840
in this case was target so the lidar

772
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,880
sensor

773
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,200
itself perceived like the environment

774
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,679
around the car

775
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,679
looking like a laser beam

776
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,519
and he calculated the distance from this

777
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,440
obstacle

778
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,519
basically perceive the echo that come

779
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:02,799
back from

780
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,840
like any obstacle calculator like the

781
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,919
timing

782
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,720
using a certain pattern

783
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,600
so here there is an example when we have

784
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,799
like a

785
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,600
common leiden spinning lidar that is

786
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,360
using for

787
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,120
getting a 3d map from the environment

788
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,600
it was a melody 16 16 because 16 was the

789
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,159
number of lasers that were shooting in

790
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:31,919
the environment

791
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,760
but they were shooting on a particular

792
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,159
order like in based on horizontal and

793
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,159
vertical in this case was vertical ahead

794
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,480
and as you can see here without a

795
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,399
certain period of time

796
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:48,080
like the laser process was handed out

797
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,559
so we have for example

798
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,640
like zero degree with the center of the

799
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,080
lighter and you have 15

800
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,440
50 laser in total like one of the upper

801
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,000
part of one

802
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,799
so just replay the echoes on the right

803
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,159
timing we were able to like

804
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,839
changing the depth of

805
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:15,199
like the pulses that we will receive it

806
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,280
and in the map

807
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,199
this was causing like a fake point

808
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:25,359
clouds that it was perceived as

809
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:26,320
like

810
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,000
object

811
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,359
in the road

812
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,839
so what we have right now is an attack

813
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,679
that involves sensor

814
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,800
and

815
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,918
these

816
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,639
combined with what we know about our

817
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,879
versatile example

818
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,760
transform this in an attack on a

819
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,399
successful and that is able to create

820
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,280
fake obstacles from

821
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,679
this was the first attack that basically

822
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,320
showed how hitting a simple hardware

823
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,719
components that can be attacked with a

824
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,079
simple replay attack can actually happen

825
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,079
the decision of a car because if a car

826
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,480
was like a detective and honestly an

827
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,440
inexistent obstacle it was changed

828
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,839
suddenly like the operation that it was

829
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,000
doing like activating the brake the

830
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,400
emergency brake because it was like an

831
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,160
obstacle appearing from the car

832
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,599
and the operation to do that was that

833
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,839
like the fake data injection was

834
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:29,599
pre-processing and like

835
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,560
go in the perception part of the machine

836
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,000
learning model

837
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,200
and after a certain operation

838
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,920
fake obstacle will produce it

839
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,040
and

840
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,079
like

841
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,440
change

842
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,920
the planning that the autonomous car was

843
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,000
making for the car trajectory

844
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,119
and this was a simple like model to car

845
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,520
to calculate how many points you needed

846
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,839
to create an obstacle and optimize that

847
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,680
and based on the confidence

848
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,320
so what we have is that like we

849
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,320
discovered that it was not necessary

850
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,599
like to

851
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,440
create the entire shape of a record for

852
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,400
example

853
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,119
here we have an example when like we

854
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,320
were able 30 meters away

855
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,680
to create just that diagonal line of

856
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,839
points and this was perceived as an

857
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:26,839
obstacle

858
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,960
and what we had at the end was like two

859
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,440
type of many uh like attacks

860
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,720
for sure making a car appear in front of

861
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,720
the car to make like the system

862
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,640
completely stop

863
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,520
or also like avoid

864
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,599
the car too

865
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,520
for example if

866
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,960
we have a fake obstacle in front of

867
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,880
a car in an intersection

868
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,599
so you may imagine how these like

869
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,320
consequences on cyber physical system

870
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,359
can be used by these attacks especially

871
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:11,200
for autonomous vehicles without humans

872
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,240
we also make an experiment and there is

873
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,800
a website so you can see it

874
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,200
that this can be done even

875
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,440
like a moving object

876
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,160
and like we build the attacking system

877
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,598
to do that continuously

878
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:32,880
so

879
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,359
we have right now

880
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,560
like the issue of or maybe the challenge

881
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,359
to not consider

882
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,480
hardware attacks have they owned but how

883
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,079
can you interact with the machine

884
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,599
learning models

885
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,920
because this is a new part this is

886
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,280
something that we didn't consider before

887
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,640
and attacker can easily access this

888
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,520
basic

889
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,280
technology and perform more

890
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,079
sophisticated

891
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:05,440
attack also

892
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,520
consumer electronic consensual the

893
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,520
bottom they become cheaper

894
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,480
and

895
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,720
uh like if you think about some years

896
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,599
ago

897
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,320
like some sense of a lidar system for

898
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,560
for example a lidar system can cause

899
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,720
thousands and thousands of dollars

900
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,640
but right now we have for example

901
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,640
solid-state lighters

902
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,520
or like more sophisticated like that

903
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,640
that was stuck like 100 dollars

904
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,320
the more we are surrounded by these

905
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,280
cheaper stuff like technology

906
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,440
and they are sophisticated but can

907
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,119
basically perceive all the world

908
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,440
surrounding us

909
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,760
the more our attacker can become a

910
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,280
vector

911
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,200
that can undermine these systems

912
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,040
so what we can do

913
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,160
so in our lab we also like understand

914
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,359
how we can prevent this kind of attacks

915
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,720
and usually is a matter of combination

916
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,359
with arduous software techniques

917
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,599
so the changes that are right now has in

918
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,760
the field is that you cannot

919
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,200
go and

920
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,599
uh like you consider other software as a

921
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,160
separate entities

922
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,880
you need to enhance both to be able to

923
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,839
compete with this type of sophisticated

924
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,160
attacks

925
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,680
you might have the comprehensive

926
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,440
techniques at the beginning on the

927
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,760
design level of the artwork but then you

928
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,920
need to expect for example for

929
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,560
electromagnetic interference for example

930
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,880
the analytical component will be always

931
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,599
be susceptible to this kind of signals

932
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:40,400
so

933
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,960
what you can do

934
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,560
another piece

935
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,880
of information that you can do is a sort

936
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,000
of detection so try to detect the what

937
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,839
is happening

938
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,320
but also maybe and this is really

939
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,599
important

940
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,000
when you apply detection the attack is

941
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,079
already in place

942
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:01,680
and if you think about the safety

943
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,599
critical system like the autonomous

944
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,680
vehicle that we see before that actually

945
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,960
is not enough

946
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,440
because it might be too late real time

947
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,119
system

948
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,400
doesn't actually

949
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,000
can be

950
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,839
like a completely safe with just a

951
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:20,400
detection system

952
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,440
and so you need to add something more

953
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,319
and one of the techniques

954
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,960
on mitigation as well

955
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,200
implied builder like it is the resilient

956
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,440
system that can also

957
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,079
like capture the signal being able to

958
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:37,839
understand that what kind of

959
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:40,319
interference you have

960
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:43,520
and be resilient

961
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,920
for medical devices for example you have

962
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,800
a particular set of

963
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,119
call emergency

964
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:52,560
operation

965
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,720
that allow the system to be resilient

966
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,280
and still continue to perform a safety

967
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,920
operation

968
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,040
so

969
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,000
this

970
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,040
uh like a conclude my thought i think i

971
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,040
i'm uh

972
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,599
i'm a bitterly or maybe i hope to be in

973
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,160
time but it's just to understand that

974
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,839
system

975
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:17,520
in some physical system nowadays

976
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,480
like are all integrated together we

977
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,760
cannot

978
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,160
like avoid to uh or maybe or treated

979
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,359
these two components as separate layers

980
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,359
and the more we go with technology i'm

981
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:34,880
thinking about satellite systems and

982
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,920
like all these automatic systems drones

983
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,520
constellation

984
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,319
automatic tract

985
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:45,760
we need to take care of both these and

986
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,839
work

987
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:48,400
together

988
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,359
and

989
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,680
now i am happy to answer all your

990
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,160
questions

991
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,920
thank you sarah for the presentation um

992
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,359
let's see if we have any questions

993
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:02,960
yes we do

994
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,760
so

995
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,130
um

996
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:06,000
[Music]

997
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,839
on the work on microphones did you

998
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:10,000
notice different behaviors on targets

999
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,800
which has which had multiple microphones

1000
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,040
as the laser was targeting only one of

1001
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,960
them i guess

1002
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,280
yes so uh

1003
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,119
the thing is

1004
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,920
for the characteristic of like this

1005
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,839
feature recognition system by design

1006
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,560
uh the system itself

1007
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,960
needs to um recognize the voice command

1008
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,200
even if you're far away so even if just

1009
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,119
one microphone was speaking out the

1010
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,079
sound

1011
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,040
so we discovered that no matter what how

1012
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,079
many microphones there was in the system

1013
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:50,960
like for example in the like some alexa

1014
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,520
device you have up to eight microphone

1015
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,440
in the same device

1016
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,560
it was just uh like possible to attack

1017
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,680
once to attack them

1018
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:03,040
this is

1019
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,200
just by design so one of the difference

1020
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,920
can be that you actually modulate and

1021
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,760
try to understand like what they

1022
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,920
perceive the other microphone but if you

1023
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,200
do that

1024
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,280
you have to keep in mind that you might

1025
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,760
be like lost quality

1026
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,880
when like only one microphone will pick

1027
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,520
the voice because maybe the the person

1028
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,040
is far away

1029
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:29,200
so it's a trade-off between the two

1030
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,839
thank you for answering the question

1031
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:37,440
do we have any other questions

1032
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,720
thank you

1033
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,880
i don't see any

1034
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,760
um so sarah thank you very much

1035
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,760
uh for the presentation

1036
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,000
i think people found it very interesting

1037
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,839
and thought provoking as i can see from

1038
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:55,119
the um comments

1039
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:56,640
so

1040
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,319
guys if you like the presentation just

1041
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,560
give a shout out to sarah and social

1042
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,960
media

1043
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,799
yes thank you

1044
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,160
um oh there is one last question that i

1045
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,079
can see here in the meanwhile um is

1046
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:13,680
there a material that can be used to

1047
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,240
reflect laser

1048
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:20,400
oh yes one of the thing is that you can

1049
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,720
i think it was in the last slide

1050
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,480
uh we also try to

1051
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,440
like understand what kind of

1052
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,000
like material can be like reflecting

1053
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,599
over light

1054
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,359
so you can apply some deflecting

1055
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:38,000
material like in general uh there's no

1056
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,680
one particular one

1057
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,880
the problem is that doing that

1058
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,319
you're covering the oil that allow like

1059
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,839
normal sound wave to come into the

1060
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:51,920
microphone so it needs to be engine

1061
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,480
nearly done pretty well

1062
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,440
to avoid to lose quality in the audio

1063
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,440
signal that you are collecting

1064
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,359
so one of the solutions that it was

1065
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:03,839
actually what they use in phones

1066
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:06,240
unintentionally

1067
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,119
was it to make this like a microphone

1068
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,000
all

1069
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,079
like

1070
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:14,720
with the displacement between the older

1071
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,040
that is in contact with the environment

1072
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,319
and the microphone menu

1073
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:22,880
and that this was make us harder to

1074
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:27,839
attack we use up to 65 millibars

1075
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,920
to be able to attack and we were able

1076
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,640
just to attack from a short distance

1077
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,240
so this kind of

1078
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,800
like prevention technique can be used to

1079
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,200
attenuate and increase the attacker

1080
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,799
effort but on the other way

1081
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,040
you're losing something on the audio

1082
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,560
quality maybe

1083
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,400
like you lose a certain physical

1084
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,800
condition so the more you had something

1085
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,200
another you might use something in the

1086
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,839
rest especially what you use for machine

1087
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,839
learning

1088
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,480
thank you thank you sarah

1089
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,960
thank you and i see one last question uh

1090
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,680
that popped up in the chat box um mark

1091
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,680
is saying thanks for the nice talk do

1092
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,119
you think that sensor fusion and

1093
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:15,200
plausibility checks could be a

1094
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,119
counter-measure to mitigate that kind of

1095
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,839
transactive fault attacks

1096
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:24,160
okay so some surfacing usually maybe

1097
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,079
is something adopted for example in

1098
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:29,040
autonomous vehicles so they

1099
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,000
capture the data from a glider camera

1100
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,079
and radar and fuse them together in a

1101
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,160
certain point of the algorithm

1102
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:36,960
so

1103
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,920
uh like usually fusion techniques have

1104
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,960
used for enlarged data so to capture one

1105
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,480
phone

1106
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,560
they are not maybe pencil fusion

1107
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,920
techniques by themselves are not the

1108
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,119
thing

1109
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,960
maybe are not the design with the

1110
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,520
attacker in mind

1111
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,599
so uh usually when we notice uh on uh

1112
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,599
for example on autonomous because in our

1113
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,760
attack it was just enough even if the

1114
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,839
sensor fusion was implemented because it

1115
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:08,560
was taking lidar and human data

1116
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,720
we were human in any case too like

1117
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:14,960
industrial obstacle this because like in

1118
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,720
especially real-time cyber physical

1119
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,760
system you have a sort of priority

1120
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,480
it means that certain information can be

1121
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,559
more relevant around

1122
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,319
and we discovered that for this

1123
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:28,960
autonomous vehicle usually they go for

1124
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,680
the safer decision possible it means

1125
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,400
that if some of the sensors perceive an

1126
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,240
obstacle

1127
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,520
it will

1128
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,839
definitely take the safer decision like

1129
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,040
to break

1130
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,280
because even maybe the camera doesn't

1131
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,400
perceive

1132
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,040
like a um

1133
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,319
an obstacle

1134
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,400
so what happened is that sensor fusion

1135
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,680
techniques that can be useful

1136
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,400
but they were not designed against this

1137
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,960
type of attacks so we need to like

1138
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,599
reinvent them in another way

1139
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:05,119
to get feedback and basically act as a

1140
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,319
sort of detection system

1141
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,720
but as i mentioned before

1142
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,720
only detection system by themselves

1143
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,880
doesn't work with this attack because

1144
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,960
it's already too late

1145
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,599
so you need to add something

1146
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:21,119
like prevention

1147
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:23,599
aside but also like build a resilient

1148
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:25,839
system that are actually able to

1149
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:28,400
mitigate even if you have this kind of

1150
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,800
incongruence between the sensors

1151
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:36,800
i hope i answer your question

1152
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,839
thank you sarah
