00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,600
joining us this afternoon i'm andrea and

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,080
i will be your host for today's session

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,160
i'm glad to welcome today felipe who is

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,240
a security researcher at quarks lab

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,680
where he had been working for the past

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,320
few years on car security his research

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,240
interest lies in embedded devices and

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,479
software defined radio and these are the

11
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,480
things that we'll touch upon today in

12
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,239
addition to answering the question why

13
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,440
and how we could be build a car in a box

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,120
fill it and now i would like to invite

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,559
you to start your presentation

16
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,800
thank you andrea welcome everyone i'm

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,640
very pleased that you joined this

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,199
webinar today we will talk about uh

19
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,199
co-working and

20
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,079
how we work in at works lab to improve

21
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,559
our carting trainings by building the

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,559
project car in a box

23
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,359
first of all before speaking about how

24
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,840
cars in a buck was built and uh what we

25
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,159
are trying to do with it i will speak a

26
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,320
little bit about automotive and cyber

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,200
security to give you

28
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,920
the word picture why cyber security is

29
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,640
important in the automotive world

30
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,360
first of all what is a car

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,280
it's the same thing that

32
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,520
as many decades if you think if you ask

33
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,960
someone

34
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,040
to describe your car is four wheels a

35
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,079
motor

36
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,920
but now it's become much much more

37
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,280
complicated

38
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,119
because there is a lot of new

39
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,680
improvement for the last decade you can

40
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,280
we saw that there is a driving

41
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,520
assistance with anti-collision system

42
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,159
line detection with a

43
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,799
on-board camera that analyze the the

44
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,040
wall environment right there you you

45
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,399
have the active espn abs for breaking

46
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,280
and

47
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,920
ending the car and also self-parking

48
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,960
features but new car also have a lot of

49
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,320
connectivity on

50
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,840
2007 if you have bluetooth in your car

51
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,800
it was a iron car now it's just a

52
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,640
mandatory feature to

53
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,680
link your phone with your sms or

54
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,239
have a call or while while driving

55
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,920
you also have gps and 4g 5g connection

56
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,000
for equal other traffic assistance and

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,800
some car also other wiffy hotspots on

58
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,000
board

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,040
but

60
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,519
by talking about onboard system you have

61
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:34,840
also onboard

62
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,000
services no modern car of

63
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,480
mobile application

64
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,280
which when you can control your car a

65
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,080
distance to start stoppage or for

66
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,519
example

67
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,120
initiate the

68
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,560
the heater

69
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,120
in winter to have a hot car when you get

70
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,000
in you have localization auto diagnostic

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,480
system and many resources

72
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,360
and

73
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,319
the most important things we

74
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,800
speak about is the autonomous driving

75
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,920
when we

76
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,680
we speak about autonomous driving we

77
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,680
will think about tesla but

78
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,480
for your information mercedes reached

79
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,640
the level three of five

80
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,440
fall 2021 for autonomous waving which

81
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,680
means the car is able to drive on a

82
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,000
specific road at a specific speed by

83
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,040
itself

84
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,599
that's very very important but

85
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,480
how can we get such uh feature and

86
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,959
intelligence into a car it's due to the

87
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,239
ucu ucu is uh stands for electronic

88
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,840
control unit

89
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,080
it's

90
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,760
like the the picture you have on the

91
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,799
right um it's a pcb with an

92
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,440
one or multiple microcontroller or

93
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,040
system on chip

94
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,440
their main role is to read data from

95
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,480
sensor

96
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,120
then from this data manage actuator to

97
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,519
control the door lock or the steering

98
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:56,560
wheel and

99
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,239
many other things

100
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,959
and to be as efficient and as

101
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,080
intelligent as they are the this is you

102
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,640
need to communicate communicate between

103
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,799
each other or to communicate with other

104
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,799
device or a back end

105
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,280
through some different networks who can

106
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,840
be wired or wireless

107
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,358
and

108
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,079
as now in a modern car you have between

109
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,520
50 to 100 of ecu inside

110
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,560
and

111
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,440
as i said there is many many networks in

112
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,479
a car the most common and the most known

113
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,880
one is the cam the control area network

114
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,520
it was built in 1986

115
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,639
and it's still very very common in car

116
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,960
most of the

117
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,479
important uh

118
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,800
systems are

119
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,680
use the canvas to to exchange data for

120
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,000
the protein power train control module

121
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,919
or download system

122
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,960
but as the feature of a new car evolves

123
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,960
we need more bandwidth we need more

124
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,280
speed and there is new network that

125
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,039
design like ethernet automotive or flex

126
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,160
rate for

127
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,520
drive by wire system and for

128
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,479
i

129
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,240
high quality multimedia content like

130
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,919
audio or video

131
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,280
they designed the most systems

132
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,919
and if we look at the car what do we

133
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,600
have we have

134
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,199
multiple

135
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,880
embedded device

136
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,800
which communicates through different

137
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,840
networks

138
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,160
and all this evolution come very quickly

139
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,280
into car

140
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,600
much more quickly than the

141
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,360
automotive manufacturer and tier one

142
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,720
manufacturer

143
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,880
were able to integrate security into it

144
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,080
and then this this lead us to a very

145
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,840
very broad

146
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,799
attack surfaces

147
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,199
in 10 years ago the main attack surface

148
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,000
you had on the car was the obd2 port the

149
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
plug you know this is uh

150
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
this plug you have near the driving

151
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,199
wheel uh for diagnostic use but right

152
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,120
now most of the attack surface are

153
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,360
wireless you have as i said bluetooth

154
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,639
connection 4g 5g connection wi-fi

155
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,600
for

156
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,160
autonomous arriving or advanced driving

157
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,080
you have all the v2

158
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,680
vehicle ground infrastructure

159
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,520
communication

160
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,000
which where the vehicle can communicate

161
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,639
between each other or between the

162
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,319
their environment

163
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,800
you also have a

164
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,880
attack surprise through the mobile phone

165
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,919
uh we adding rfid or uhf or standard 4g

166
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,120
communication

167
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,840
and all the all the electrical vehicles

168
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,520
are

169
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,160
growing in numbers uh you also have now

170
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,960
the

171
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,560
proline communication as an attack

172
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,759
surface when you plug your car into the

173
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,919
power charge it will communicate with

174
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,440
the grid to

175
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,720
see how

176
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,560
it can

177
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,759
efficiently

178
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,639
get

179
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,360
energy with the grid so you have also

180
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,360
this kind of communication and you have

181
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,280
computer vision for

182
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,599
obstacle avoidance and many other things

183
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,919
or thermal imaging

184
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:08,800
and

185
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,759
with all these features this leads us to

186
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,280
a major milestone so as i said before

187
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,199
there is many many many new features and

188
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,039
improvements

189
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,160
that were

190
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,000
implemented into a car

191
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,720
but

192
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,759
the

193
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,080
cyber security was not

194
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,400
their main

195
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,319
was was not an aspect of the the

196
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,160
production so in 2015 two researchers

197
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,880
chris miller and balazak uh

198
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,520
did a very very important things um on a

199
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,319
jeep vehicle there was a an infotainment

200
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,960
unit you know the unit you use to listen

201
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,599
to music and so on it has connectivity

202
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,759
through the one star systems

203
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,319
and uh over the year update but those

204
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,479
updates were not secure at all so they

205
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,000
managed to get a camera patch it with a

206
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,879
background from from from us and through

207
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,440
an exposed port update to serve

208
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,680
an expo services sorry they update the

209
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,680
firmware and they have control over the

210
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,440
wall car

211
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,080
there is no segregation between canvas

212
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,960
so

213
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,240
with the

214
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,479
the infotainment canvas they managed to

215
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,639
have control over the

216
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,039
braking system or powertrain control

217
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,520
module and were able to accelerate or

218
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,240
brake or turn the wheel while while the

219
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,639
vehicle was running and without any

220
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,639
control from the driver

221
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,559
and this milestone was very important

222
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,599
because

223
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,320
it's show to the different manufacturer

224
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,719
oh it is important to integrate cyber

225
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,719
security into

226
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,279
the vehicle manufacturing

227
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,440
this is this

228
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,560
well

229
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,440
there are a proof of concept

230
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,519
get to the recall of 1.5 million of

231
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,839
vehicles in the u.s which is very very

232
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,760
important

233
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,440
as we saw

234
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,920
in features new features

235
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,720
were

236
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,760
evolving very quickly into vehicle and

237
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,320
but regulations were quite slower there

238
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,600
is a major regulation in 2020 from the

239
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,320
united nations or group 29 which

240
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,600
integrated

241
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,720
cyber security into the regulation no

242
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,519
new car from 2022 must have a

243
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,800
secure other

244
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,920
sexual firmware uh updates uh integrated

245
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,040
and

246
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,720
during the whole

247
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,040
cycle life cycle of the vehicle cyber

248
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,279
security has to be managed and

249
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,800
integrated to the development but with

250
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,880
those there is a very

251
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,040
a great difference between security and

252
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,959
safety to remind you um safety is to uh

253
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,160
avoid you being armed by um

254
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,080
something exterior you know you're

255
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,240
driving at the road there there is eyes

256
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,480
on the road so you you have to keep

257
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,839
control uh

258
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,640
of your vehicle that's that's where esp

259
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,680
uh get in action and this is safety and

260
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,399
security is to avoid that

261
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,399
an attacker or something malicious arm

262
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,640
yourself or get uh

263
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,560
information from you that you don't want

264
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,760
to

265
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,959
to

266
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,320
to let out

267
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,800
and um there is also regulation about

268
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,880
safety like the ecole

269
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,720
in since

270
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,240
2015

271
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,240
2056

272
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,519
the eco is no monitoring to new cars

273
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,600
that means every new car

274
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,480
produce manufacturer are

275
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,720
gnss connective connectivity they can

276
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,160
read gnss data but they also have

277
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,920
data voice call and um

278
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,720
communication source for 5g onboard

279
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,200
every new vehicle all of it

280
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,839
for example in 2029 there was also the

281
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,079
tpms it's a tire pressure monitoring

282
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,720
systems that alert you when you have a

283
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,600
flat tire and this is also modulatory

284
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,839
and for a direct system that means you

285
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,920
have a uhf connection between every of

286
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,959
your tires and one of your ecu and there

287
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,720
are proof of concepts that you can

288
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,920
manage

289
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,839
you can craft

290
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,000
malicious signals to

291
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,839
to to get rid of to to to have action on

292
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,519
some issues so

293
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,360
we saw that cyber security into

294
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,480
automotive is very important because uh

295
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,000
we need safety

296
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,360
but bringing safety into car also bring

297
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,440
needs in security

298
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,399
and

299
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,920
if we get back to what a car is as i

300
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,959
said it's different embedded device all

301
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,000
the ucu and different networks that

302
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,760
communicate

303
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,600
allows you to communicate between each

304
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,560
other

305
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,480
and we are

306
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,760
clearly in our uh in quarks lab uh

307
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,240
domain of competence you know so it's

308
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,120
been years for now we are doing security

309
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,920
assessment on uc when cars we are doing

310
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,920
orion software

311
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,279
assessments

312
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,880
but we

313
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,519
also find very important to train to

314
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,079
to get people working into car different

315
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,639
actors so since they will be

316
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,680
sensibilized to the importance of having

317
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,639
secure systems and that's why we develop

318
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,839
uh many karaki trainings

319
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,120
and

320
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,600
creating a parking training is not as

321
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,399
easy as it seems why because

322
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,519
you have to

323
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,920
work on different network you have to

324
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,279
work and

325
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,399
teach how a canvas works but not only

326
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,639
canvas because there is many other

327
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,800
things and for each network you have

328
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,519
different protocol you have can you have

329
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,920
upper protocol like uds is a tpe or

330
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,720
specific internet protocol i do ip some

331
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,760
ip

332
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,200
so very very large range of things to

333
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,399
get in um a car is also a hardware

334
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,480
system with many hardware

335
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,120
embedded system in it and each system

336
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,880
has software so

337
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,800
you have to get

338
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,680
on every kind of

339
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,160
issues or vulnerability you can have

340
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,120
both in software or hardware or relation

341
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,160
for

342
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,360
both of them

343
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,440
and now you have also front and back and

344
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,880
applications like the infotainment

345
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,639
system and the backend like i said apply

346
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,440
api sorry to to control your car with

347
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,519
your mobile and each lcu has its own

348
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,160
architecture so uh when you are working

349
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,200
on a car you will have some kind of os

350
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,800
like for the infotainment the gen ev or

351
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,079
qnx

352
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,279
uos some other os we have will work on

353
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,079
an imperviser but

354
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,959
most of the ucu will be just a

355
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,600
microcontroller so

356
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,800
they will be

357
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,360
running a specific

358
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,160
firmware for their own architecture and

359
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,320
uc architecture are not the most common

360
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,160
you will find in other embedded devices

361
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,880
you will have tri-core or renesas

362
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,880
actuator which are not always well

363
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,959
documented so as you say as you see uh

364
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,279
creating a karaking training is quite

365
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,000
complicated because you have to get in

366
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,399
all of those aspects

367
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,240
that's why we decided to

368
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,639
get it easy at first and uh

369
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,800
we built an open source solution

370
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,839
which were the tiny ucu tinyu is based

371
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,720
on a tnc microcontroller

372
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
you can see on the bottom left of the

373
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,440
picture and it interacts with different

374
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,880
sensors and actuators like a real ecu

375
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,560
and it simulates

376
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,440
four different seo it was quite basic

377
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,160
and very good to um to attend this to

378
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,680
get a

379
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,399
to get a fresh start into karaking and

380
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,720
all canvas worked

381
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,760
but

382
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,320
this solution was not perfect if you

383
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,399
want to get the word picture

384
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,440
so

385
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,920
this is a little bit of teaser for the

386
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,720
the next incoming training

387
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,680
we designed the connected tiny ecu it

388
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,399
was a major improvement of the tiny ecu

389
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,320
you have two canvas you have different

390
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,839
microcontrollers

391
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,399
which manage a modern protocol like some

392
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,839
ip2ip

393
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,800
uh traditional protocol hqds can and so

394
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,000
on you have an onboard backend api to

395
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,680
simulate

396
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,600
exchange of the mobile phone and to

397
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,240
demonstrate some common vulnerabilities

398
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,279
it has its own key fob to

399
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,639
to have

400
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,560
passive killers and remote killer sentry

401
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,120
capabilities where there is also a lot

402
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,519
of vulnerabilities to to demonstrate and

403
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,920
it integrates a real ecu

404
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,959
so

405
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,360
you have a lot of

406
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,959
possibility with it

407
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,040
however even

408
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,519
doing search design is not

409
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,240
as real as you can have if you use a car

410
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,440
a real car so

411
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,759
the main idea when we did our training

412
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,160
was to bring a car to the training

413
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,360
but

414
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,839
it is not as perfect as it seems why

415
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,079
because first of all you cannot do such

416
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,320
things everywhere there is some place

417
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,279
you can you will

418
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,800
do your training

419
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,639
without any garage and so on so you

420
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,120
cannot park the car and but without the

421
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,079
car you can have the real things

422
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,800
then it's very it's out there uh the

423
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
pace of the training you know you're in

424
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,399
the conference room you're doing your

425
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,120
labs and so on you're pitching stuff and

426
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,600
then everyone has to pack his laptop to

427
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,639
go down two floors downstairs get to the

428
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,440
car you have to prepare the car and then

429
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,000
attendees can start playing with the car

430
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,600
but even when they start playing with

431
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,839
the car you can fit one two three four

432
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,759
people into the car we really see what's

433
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,680
happening and all the other ones are

434
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,480
waiting and it's not quite good uh it's

435
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,680
not quite

436
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,160
it's not as good as it has to be

437
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,920
for the the attendees

438
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,240
and when you do such things you have to

439
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,919
get access to a car you know because uh

440
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,439
if you want to show tricks you have to

441
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,839
to master it and when you play on a real

442
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,959
car you you still have the risk to break

443
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,000
it uh for example every car have what we

444
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,079
call a crash frame so if you fuse the

445
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,039
canvas and you trigger the cam frame

446
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,720
uh the

447
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,880
power control module will get in safety

448
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,840
and you

449
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,840
won't start your car again

450
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,240
unless you have access to a

451
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,039
manufacturer diagnostic tool so

452
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,960
having cartridge training is not

453
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,360
the the perfect solution and that's why

454
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,600
we decide to work on the car in a box

455
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,360
project the idea is to get a car which

456
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,640
is portable which can travel with in

457
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,720
train in car in

458
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,280
in by plan to get

459
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,840
to our training worldwide

460
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,760
and we get to this

461
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,480
i present you the car in a box so it's a

462
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,360
wrecked case uh which

463
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,799
respects the

464
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,520
the dimension to get into into a plane

465
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,360
it has 16 you see one inside the most

466
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,919
important one for all the feature all

467
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,080
the

468
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,640
the main aspect we want to demonstrate

469
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,679
on on the car it has four car networks

470
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,080
many lean networks lin is a cheap

471
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,480
network's very common in car we have a

472
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,640
full infotainment system which is very

473
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,679
important bluetooth and 3g connectivity

474
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,919
we have a commanded control panel which

475
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,280
can be

476
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,520
connected through ip to have a remote

477
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,120
control and to

478
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,039
this panel is uh is important also

479
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,799
because each of the real estate of the

480
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,320
car so when you start

481
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,400
sending command of using the bus the

482
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,559
different bases you can compare the

483
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,880
effect you have on for example the

484
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,559
instrument panel cluster

485
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,280
and

486
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,679
the real estate of the car

487
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,240
and how did we build that that's the

488
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,039
main

489
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,799
one of the important things

490
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,559
first of all you have to gather parts

491
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,559
you have to collect ucu

492
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,360
the first idea you can have is to go on

493
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,160
online on some different websites and to

494
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,400
get uh

495
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,919
used ucu

496
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,039
but uh

497
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,720
doing such thing is not the best

498
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,200
solution why because some ucu are what

499
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,240
we call enrolled bsa share information

500
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,880
between them if if they don't

501
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,480
have the same information they won't

502
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,960
start they won't work correctly

503
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,440
it's to avoid them

504
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,440
safe or things like that

505
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,280
to avoid that people

506
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,679
reduce the value of the odometer and

507
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:42,559
they can

508
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,960
resell their car with less calorimeter

509
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,919
than they

510
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,280
they really have

511
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,200
um

512
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,320
then

513
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,120
you you will need to to to work properly

514
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,799
you will need to have access to a car

515
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,640
when you can uh

516
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,280
jump read all the buses uh you have to

517
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,440
access to the same model of a working

518
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,080
car because also you see you some use

519
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,240
you need what we call a wake up frame if

520
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,480
there is not a good frame on the canvas

521
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,360
or some other bus the issue won't wake

522
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,320
up

523
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,799
because a car has to be

524
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,360
energy efficient and when you park your

525
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,320
car you want it that it draw your party

526
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,080
in one or two days

527
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,120
um that's why we decided to to get to

528
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,559
scrappy arduino and to

529
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,039
to scrap a wall car and we gather all

530
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,440
the ucu all the ryan ms in intact so

531
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,440
the the best solution we had to avoid

532
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,400
also the problem i list before

533
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,039
next once you have all your receive uh

534
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,120
you have to plan plug everything back

535
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,760
and honestly it's the

536
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,600
most difficult and the

537
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,360
the most time consuming

538
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,520
task first of all you have to find the

539
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,799
documentation the technical

540
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,520
documentation to know which pin on each

541
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,559
pcu

542
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,919
is used to

543
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,880
be poured on and which are the pin to

544
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,840
that act as a network and so on

545
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,120
if you have

546
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,200
quick tips if you have a ucu with more

547
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,600
than 20 30 pins

548
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,120
don't try to

549
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,159
get its own connector because you will

550
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,400
lost a lot of waste a lot of time to

551
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,640
find the good wire because all the way

552
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,559
around almost the same color or same

553
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,120
diameter it will be quicker to plug

554
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,720
directly to the

555
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,000
to the pin into the ecu to to get access

556
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,799
to

557
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,000
what you want

558
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,120
um

559
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,520
we also made what i will call a mistake

560
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,080
uh it's to keep all the wire as intact

561
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,039
as it can be because you let's you lose

562
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,520
a lot of time to untangle everything and

563
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,080
clean everything because it's with a lot

564
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,440
of grease and

565
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,760
in glue over all those things

566
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,200
um

567
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,080
if you don't find a ground on the pin of

568
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,919
your receiver it means that the body of

569
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,000
your issue is the ground

570
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,640
it's very common on safety you see you

571
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,760
like the airbag for example

572
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,600
to illustrate uh

573
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,919
what it's

574
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,679
some

575
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,679
work in progress while building the the

576
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,240
car in a box you have on the left uh

577
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,840
the wall harness entangle which we

578
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,480
waste many many hours two hours to get

579
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,280
in

580
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,159
in shape and then uh

581
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,280
some progressing

582
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,960
connectivity and

583
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,120
identification and good wires to to

584
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,520
connect every ecu together

585
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,120
uh while you're having all your ecu on

586
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,080
your hand it's very important and useful

587
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,320
to

588
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,120
do a reconnaissance on all this stuff so

589
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,000
you

590
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,840
remove the

591
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,320
cbody and look at all the pcb it's very

592
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,120
very interesting you can identify what

593
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,720
ships are used

594
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,720
if it is a microcontroller or system or

595
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,799
chip or maybe many of them

596
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,799
if you have access to ephraim or flash

597
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,240
ship dump it

598
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,440
because

599
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,880
in case of a wrong command if you you do

600
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,440
bad things you can refresh it and avoid

601
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,520
to break your car in a box

602
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,280
um

603
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,799
if you also

604
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,400
can look at

605
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,360
some

606
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,960
debugged access like a gtac port on some

607
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,799
software debug ports that are not so

608
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:25,919
common but

609
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,919
it's always useful to to get access to

610
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,159
it to to know where they are

611
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,720
and then once you know the the

612
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,320
the chip you have you can look for

613
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,960
documentation and have a very good

614
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,760
knowledge of everything for

615
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,480
the future path if you want to reverse

616
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,360
some

617
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,240
some firmware and so on

618
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,720
then you have all you receive you

619
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,960
connect them together and

620
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,919
the next step you want to have

621
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,400
a bench bench test

622
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,640
which work like a real car so you want

623
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,120
to emulate the sensor and on a car you

624
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,919
have

625
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,480
four kinds of sensor the most common one

626
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,720
the most easy to to to to emulate is a

627
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,279
simple relationship grant or relate to a

628
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,679
plus 12 volt

629
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,600
so it's quite easy

630
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,520
if you have a

631
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,600
voltage on the on the wire it's minor

632
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,679
one and if you drop to zero or the

633
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,679
inverse it's minus zero

634
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,400
and then uh you have a lot of sensor

635
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,240
which acts like a

636
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,640
barrier which need a variable resistance

637
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,600
like a potentiometer for example

638
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,240
the accelerator pedal or brake pedal the

639
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,480
more you push through the more

640
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,520
the more resistance it will have so well

641
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,679
you have to simulate this and then you

642
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,640
have two more uh signal to

643
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,120
you can have in a car you are squeezing

644
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,200
now like the

645
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,360
green signal you have on the right for

646
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,520
example you you will have it

647
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,840
on the motor for the crankshaft or

648
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,760
things like that to to get or in the

649
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,240
wheel to to get the speed of your car

650
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,880
and not so common but quite complicated

651
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,720
to emulate this uh array signal

652
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,120
sometimes you can emulate earthquaking

653
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,760
eye to get the same effect like like a

654
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,440
wave signal but not also and how did we

655
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,679
emulate all the sensor for relay to

656
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,480
ground it's quite easy uh you have

657
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,520
we used

658
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,279
an arduino mega

659
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,320
because it has a very

660
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,320
it has a lot of uh input output uh on it

661
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,240
to emulate uh really to ground or

662
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,720
related to only to one sorry i would

663
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,640
just connect to a pin and set it to one

664
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,840
or not

665
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,200
to get the the results

666
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,919
for variable resistance we used digital

667
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,960
potentiometer and so we can adjust

668
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,559
using a digital value the

669
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,080
the impedance

670
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:54,880
the

671
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,039
resistance we want to add the good

672
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,000
signal

673
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,880
and for square signal um

674
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,159
using the

675
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,240
the pwm

676
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,120
the onboard pwm arduino is not accurate

677
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,279
enough so

678
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,960
we we did uh

679
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,960
uh some

680
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,679
uh

681
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,320
sorry uh we use assembly card uh from

682
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,400
the the microcontroller of the the

683
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,520
arduino to to generate a very quick and

684
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,880
precise clock signal uh and add square

685
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,760
signals you know you you alter uh up and

686
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,840
down and you you get it

687
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,880
um

688
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,360
quick tip if you want to to to do the

689
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,840
same thing uh having access to a dynamic

690
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,120
software when you can read the value

691
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,000
of each sensor is very useful so

692
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,200
you can find you can tune the

693
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,360
the good output of your microcontroller

694
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,799
and add the

695
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,039
the result you want

696
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,760
also some critical sensor uh actual

697
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,880
authoritars likes the one for the airbag

698
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,620
to

699
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,120
[Music]

700
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,400
need a two-ohm resistor uh as a

701
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,640
proof-of-life otherwise if you don't

702
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,159
have this resistance on them

703
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,080
you will have a default on your car and

704
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,480
it will not work as you you want

705
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,720
all sensors are not wired some sensors

706
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,520
are

707
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,919
using a radio frequency signals for

708
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,000
example like the tpms the tire pressure

709
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,960
metering systems so we also

710
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,000
emulate all the sensor we used a

711
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,360
software defined radio system

712
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,080
the jastic one and we

713
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,520
we we record a signal from uh working

714
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,200
tire pressure tpms and we craft uh the

715
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,640
defect signal we want and so we have a

716
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,480
fully working

717
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,440
system

718
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,120
using this uh

719
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,360
adding this sdr device sorry into the

720
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,120
car in a box allows also more

721
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,000
more feature like we can now replay or

722
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,760
record

723
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,320
key fob

724
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,760
keyframe interaction when you press your

725
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,240
key fob to lock or unlock the the car we

726
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,880
can recall it and we play it and we can

727
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,840
demonstrate our remote keyless entry

728
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,960
works and for example our

729
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,520
wording codes are implemented to avoid

730
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,760
uh teeth

731
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,279
to to avoid that achieve steal your car

732
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,279
and then the last things

733
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,310
you have a working car but you want to

734
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,760
[Music]

735
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,880
it has to be used at the

736
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,559
uh

737
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,799
sorry um i'm looking for

738
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,640
from my world

739
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,880
you have to use it for your training so

740
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,960
you have to interact it with it

741
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,760
quite easily and to demonstrate things

742
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,840
so we built a command and control system

743
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,919
based on a raspberry pi

744
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,159
which has its own ui

745
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,000
there is a touchscreen on the car in the

746
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,520
box and

747
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,440
the raspberry pi communicates through a

748
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,080
serial communication with the arduino

749
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,480
and with this we can read the real value

750
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,600
like

751
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,480
which is the speed that is simulated to

752
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,159
the sensors or what is the the status of

753
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,399
some error of or

754
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,440
are the the lights turn on and off so

755
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,399
you can

756
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:22,320
check everything and trigger uh a lot of

757
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,679
things not everything but you can

758
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,080
trigger a lot of things on the car like

759
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,240
you you can see on the pictures

760
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,480
and as it is a raspberry pi uh it has ip

761
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,960
communication so we can control on or

762
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,559
broadcast the

763
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,360
screen remotely which is very useful for

764
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,360
trainings

765
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,799
so uh

766
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,000
to

767
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,440
to get to to the end of this

768
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,840
presentation uh

769
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,640
what

770
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,520
experience we earn of building a car in

771
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,480
a box

772
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,960
uh first of all there's some things that

773
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,480
we find very very interesting that um

774
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,840
usu are not dedicated to one

775
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,480
model of car you will find the same kind

776
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,480
of issue between different models of the

777
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,960
same brand same manufacturer or you can

778
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,720
find the same issue

779
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,720
share between different manufacturers

780
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,039
that's very important because that means

781
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,080
if you find a vulnerability into a ucu

782
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,039
it can affect a very very wide range of

783
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,039
cars

784
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,440
another lesson learned is that not all

785
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,360
sensors are real time

786
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,399
for example the fuel level

787
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,440
made an average of every values it's

788
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,440
read in a minute so if you try to

789
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,080
to spoof or fuse the

790
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,880
the data associated to the fuel level

791
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,960
you will not find

792
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,279
you will not see a result

793
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,000
directly you have to wait a little bit

794
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,640
so be patient if you want to build your

795
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,960
own test bench own kind of box

796
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,679
on a security point of view most of the

797
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,760
microcontroller or system or ship have a

798
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,000
real protection to avoid to then the

799
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,200
firmware

800
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,480
it's not

801
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,000
it was not designed to to

802
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,480
to protect again malicious

803
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,880
people but mostly to deceive chip

804
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,799
tunings which is a

805
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,559
something manufactured car manufacturers

806
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,720
want to avoid

807
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,519
now for us at gold club brazil boiling a

808
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,440
basic benchmark

809
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,320
for knowledge is very very easy because

810
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,559
when you connect so many usu

811
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,720
just connecting one or two uh together

812
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,440
is quite easy and the last thing um is

813
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,760
if you have access uh if you want to get

814
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,399
into a car having access to third party

815
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,640
diagnostic app application is very

816
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,519
useful because you can have some

817
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,519
information about the

818
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,799
item id and the canvas or

819
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,360
manufacturer command

820
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,519
that were hidden and you can work with

821
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,679
those commands and see if there is

822
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,840
something you can leverage to have a

823
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,880
specific interaction or access

824
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,760
in parties if you want to the care in a

825
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,399
box was used multiple times we did a

826
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,559
different

827
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,039
internal academic quartz lab uh when we

828
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,720
we play with it we

829
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,640
we can learn uh to teach uh betty's

830
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,080
basis uh

831
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,279
on kirking and you will also see it at

832
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,320
the next arduous usa 2022 in june at

833
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,559
santa clara if you want to

834
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,200
to to have fun to learn karaking to play

835
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,960
with the car in a box and you connect it

836
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,960
in c and so on so

837
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,760
i hope you

838
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,600
you enjoyed this presentation and if you

839
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,519
have any questions feel free to ask

840
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,320
thank you very much for the presentation

841
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,080
we actually do have two questions

842
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,440
already and

843
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,120
while we are answering them i would

844
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,799
encourage others to write their

845
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,840
questions if they have some

846
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,120
so the first question is i have

847
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,919
tried using the ics

848
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:08,080
em is there any alternatives available

849
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,600
well i see uh icscm ic sim for

850
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,360
instrument cluster simulation is a very

851
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,880
good basis to

852
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,440
understand how a canvas works but it's

853
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,240
very limited because um you think you

854
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,159
will trigger the light but you will only

855
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,360
trigger the information on the dashboard

856
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,960
that the lights are on not the real

857
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,720
lights um

858
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,320
there is some

859
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,480
i think the

860
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,880
get to get get a look at the cracking

861
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,919
village

862
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,399
they did very good stuff and i know

863
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,039
there is a they did a game a vr game

864
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,200
when you have some characting stuff and

865
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,320
uh

866
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,640
you you have some fork or icy sim which

867
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,519
are

868
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,080
a little bit realistic but not as

869
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,799
realistic as a car as a tiny ecu

870
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,679
thank you

871
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,679
another question is

872
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,960
there is no mention of open xc

873
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,000
xcp port this not cut

874
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,519
is this not considered part of the

875
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,199
attack surface

876
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,520
uh open xcp is a protocol it's not a

877
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,520
port at all so you can have you you have

878
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,760
access to open xcp through the canvas

879
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,839
and all the other things like that so

880
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:21,440
yeah i was wider when i speak i would

881
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,159
attack surface

882
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,320
all right another question is uh how

883
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,199
long did it take to build the box

884
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,520
many weeks

885
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:37,040
it took me two days to scrub the car

886
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,520
because i want to keep every uco and we

887
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,918
are harnessed as intact as it could be

888
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,679
and then to

889
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,839
as i said i i made many mistakes because

890
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:50,639
it was my first big dance best so test

891
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,800
bench story though

892
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,839
all the recommendations i gave you or

893
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:57,440
could

894
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,079
help you gain some time but

895
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,640
between three to four weeks to to build

896
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,760
all together

897
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,520
including all software and so on

898
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,560
all right yes uh

899
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,800
this was another question another person

900
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,640
asked the same question how long did it

901
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,200
take but there's another

902
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,079
question

903
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,240
and how much did it cost

904
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,480
uh well go to i ebay or some see

905
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,880
a website like that and look for the

906
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,599
price of the uc you need

907
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,440
if you want to have something very cool

908
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,079
to work with i would recommend to

909
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,400
have access to an infotainment unit

910
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,839
because

911
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,280
you will have the

912
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,760
most of the interesting communication

913
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,760
attack surface with it like bluetooth

914
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,480
wi-fi if there are some similarities

915
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,560
an entertainment use it i used

916
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,480
infotainment using a unit could be

917
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,760
between two and one euro dollar too

918
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,720
much more but yeah

919
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,800
and if you have a good friend like mine

920
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,280
uh we break its car it will be shipped

921
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,720
thank you

922
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,839
and uh i see one last question uh does

923
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,800
any of the ecu's supports support uds

924
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,839
protocol all the uc supports uds

925
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,760
protocol because it's you know it's

926
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,040
mandatory uh occur um when i i spoke

927
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,200
about the regulation um

928
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,359
for on their environmental needs and for

929
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:26,560
for

930
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,040
maintenance all this issue

931
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,720
needs to be

932
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,640
diagnosed you need to have access to a

933
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,440
diagnostic system so you will find uds

934
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,720
in almost every modern car

935
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,200
all right

936
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,400
a few other questions uh came in uh

937
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,240
is it possible to purchase a car in the

938
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,720
box as a whole unit

939
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,000
uh some company

940
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,520
will

941
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,680
not a car in a box but big test bench

942
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,280
for um

943
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,599
to for for to to

944
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:03,839
to teach to workshop uh to to garage uh

945
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,079
or to work with the car so it's it's

946
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:06,839
quite

947
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:08,000
expensive between

948
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,599
i think i saw some between 5 000 and 6

949
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,119
000 euros

950
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,440
but you know it's designed to be into

951
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,200
workshops so you can travel with it it's

952
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,000
very very big but it's you have a

953
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,240
real 12 volt batteries you have all the

954
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,160
parts of a car and so

955
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,560
mechanics student can learn how to

956
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,880
perform diagnostics use diagnostic tools

957
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,839
to visit but it's not a cheap solution

958
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,079
all right um can you recover firmware in

959
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,760
ecu of somebody

960
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,320
some damages breaks it uh during the pen

961
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,520
test

962
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,480
yeah as i said if you have access to

963
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,359
to to the ecu before playing with it uh

964
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:50,960
try to get the

965
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,599
first so if you did something bad you

966
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,839
can refresh it but to refresh it or to

967
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,400
dump it you sometimes need a specific

968
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,280
hardware because

969
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,839
as i said

970
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:07,200
um microcontroller used in ucu are very

971
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,640
specific

972
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,680
terms are dedicated to to

973
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,640
to some kind of embedded device for um

974
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,400
for automotive or

975
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,480
some specific industry

976
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,960
and uh you will not always find the

977
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,000
correct documentation or as i said most

978
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,079
of the times there will be

979
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,240
a real protection in place

980
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:28,960
for

981
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,640
renissa's

982
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,320
microcontroller for example you will

983
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,000
need to get uh their proprietary

984
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,800
hardware interface to to get to it so

985
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,040
that's not something that's quite

986
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,480
useful easy to to get it together sorry

987
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,280
and

988
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,960
sometimes you can also

989
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,280
look at

990
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,320
manufacturer websites to find if there

991
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,400
is some firmware update available you

992
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,920
can download

993
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,400
and hope that they are not encrypted for

994
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,480
infotainment unit for example they are

995
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,000
almost mostly

996
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,520
it's very common now but they are

997
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,280
encrypted

998
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,400
and last idea about it is you

999
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,200
if you dig in into the internet um you

1000
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,359
may find some websites where you can

1001
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:15,119
have a lot of

1002
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,200
camera available for a few bucks

1003
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,240
thank you

1004
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,800
and let's take one last question

1005
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,040
how gross was the car used to create the

1006
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,520
car in the box

1007
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,880
it was not running anymore

1008
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,800
all the issues were intact but

1009
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,480
all their bug

1010
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,240
were well on and stuff like that and the

1011
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,079
the car body was pretty bad

1012
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,599
all right thank you very much for

1013
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,599
answering the questions and also for the

1014
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,119
presentation

1015
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,079
um

1016
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,839
guys if you liked today's session and

1017
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:55,040
would like to learn more about

1018
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,440
automotive security filippo will deliver

1019
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,640
a training as he said at hardware io usa

1020
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,560
in the first week of june and his

1021
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,160
training will not only cover the

1022
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,640
theoretical parts but also there will be
