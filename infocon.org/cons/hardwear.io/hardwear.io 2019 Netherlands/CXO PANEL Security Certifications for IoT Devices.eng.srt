1
00:00:02,179 --> 00:00:07,830
okay well welcome everybody this is the

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,530
closing events of Abreu I hope you

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,080
enjoyed and so far at a conference also

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:16,259
the other events that have been

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:20,039
organized outside so really really happy

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:23,249
to be here moderating in the hardware 6o

7
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:25,890
panel security certification for hai ot

8
00:00:23,249 --> 00:00:28,049
devices well we're here for

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,460
notable gentlemen from the industry we

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,829
have Cora Scott from Google

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,540
we have Roberta Lansing from harm then

12
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:36,180
we are approved from NCC group and

13
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,600
Stefano is an arrow from Politecnico di

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,000
Milano

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,570
I will just leave just what immediately

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,580
to them to make another view and to a

17
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,190
billion production but I would also pass

18
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:49,860
along the first question what are

19
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,800
reviews on security certification and if

20
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,420
your organization is involved in any way

21
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,730
would you like to share anything

22
00:00:53,420 --> 00:01:01,170
interesting regarding this topic please

23
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:03,779
Cory so hello everyone I'm Cory Scott

24
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,420
I'm at Google Ness I head up security

25
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:11,369
and privacy or that part of the

26
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:13,770
organization and as far as answering the

27
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:17,630
first question regarding certification

28
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:22,229
the Google is definitely involved both

29
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:29,579
by providing feedback to governmental

30
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:32,639
and nonprofit organizations for industry

31
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:37,199
certifications as well as attempting to

32
00:01:32,639 --> 00:01:39,479
build in good certifications for the the

33
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:45,420
people who manufacture components for

34
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:47,759
our devices so Thank You Roberto we have

35
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,490
to share the mic yes I'm Roberto

36
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,159
I am an architect arm or so the resident

37
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:58,079
cryptographer and we security analysis

38
00:01:53,159 --> 00:02:00,240
for the key textual team and I ever kind

39
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,979
of share both words because of a makka

40
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,958
democrat ground and was at university

41
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:08,369
before selling my soul to industry so

42
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,509
you wanted to hear something about the

43
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:13,640
first question yes we

44
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:17,030
we believe certification for security is

45
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:20,750
important we have historically not being

46
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:22,370
done much in this area because we were

47
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,470
just delivering the I Rollins as well

48
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:27,770
the silicon and not even that the

49
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:29,090
blueprints for the silicon but as people

50
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:31,820
familiar with some things like they say

51
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:35,690
know that now will have to certify how

52
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:37,540
some of our stuff is being used say this

53
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:43,280
is the type of process this is starting

54
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:44,780
at arm Robert please Rob would NCC group

55
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,640
I run our hardware and embedded systems

56
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:49,280
practice and one of the things that we

57
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,140
do quite a lot is help our customers who

58
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,480
are building embedded devices of all

59
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,130
sorts in particular regarding

60
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,000
certifications a couple of our clients

61
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,530
have actually started their own

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,030
certification program if you would like

63
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,770
to kind of connect to their network use

64
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:03,290
their technology you have to have your

65
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:05,690
your device has to pass certain certain

66
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:07,160
certifications that they've set out but

67
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,550
almost all of these are kind of a bare

68
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,410
minimum

69
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,910
none of them are like setting a very

70
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,620
high bar but they're there trying to

71
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:14,329
change the whole ecosystem at once and

72
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,650
there's right now there's not a lot of

73
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:20,930
security as we all know in some of these

74
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:23,960
these low-cost devices I'm Stefano I'm

75
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:26,810
from academia and contrary to what

76
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:31,580
Roberto said we don't sell Souls because

77
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:34,580
we don't have honey so before joining

78
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:36,320
academia I actually had a soul and I

79
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:39,500
created the penetration testing company

80
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,840
one of the little is all this so I've

81
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,730
had my fair share of looking at devices

82
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,720
and tried to figure out how to say that

83
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:49,399
they were secure enough the I'm

84
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:53,960
currently involved in several

85
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:57,440
certification working groups both in the

86
00:03:53,960 --> 00:04:00,650
area of the cybersecurity act and in the

87
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,270
area of medical devices thank you

88
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:04,850
well brief introduction I'm Christopher

89
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:06,470
moon I will be moderating despondent

90
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:08,480
without any soul at all I would just be

91
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:11,359
brain and no heart and I will be painful

92
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,459
as much as I can help you just teasing a

93
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,549
bit know the reason for this panel is

94
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:19,489
that of course everybody understand that

95
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:21,969
the need for certification devise a way

96
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:25,250
to improve and the famous raised the bar

97
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,930
for attackers and so on

98
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:32,810
there are several initiatives which are

99
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:35,169
not always thought together then we have

100
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:38,120
a regulatory framework like au

101
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:41,120
cybersecurity Act and easie we have a

102
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,950
PSA from Arman certification and Roberto

103
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,860
I think is going to touch a few bees

104
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:47,570
here and there whenever possible I think

105
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:51,919
it was about time to ask a few questions

106
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:55,780
which are not often asked and the next

107
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:58,490
one is actually Indians we know that

108
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:00,140
security devices devices actually come

109
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,410
from a very long supply chain and

110
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:06,320
pendant from yesterday from Axl as a

111
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:08,979
beautifully touched upon this so in the

112
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,900
end the final outcome and the device is

113
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:14,060
the product and outcome over the entire

114
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:16,250
industry so the question is that is the

115
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,710
old thing the OEM and I am responsible

116
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:21,050
for the entire device security an

117
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:22,760
effective way of approaching a UT

118
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,500
security or do you think there are

119
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,270
better ways for approaching it in a

120
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:30,200
sustainable way who wants to take the

121
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:33,200
question first go ahead continue stab

122
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,700
yes so fundamentally when you're as a

123
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,710
consumer you're buying a product a car

124
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,870
computer whatever it is you're giving

125
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:40,130
money to you know Best Buy or GM or

126
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:42,560
someone and you're getting this this

127
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:44,450
piece of machinery if it has any

128
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,040
security issues that's who you should be

129
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:48,469
going to to get your money back and

130
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,250
that's the way like if I go buy a Wi-Fi

131
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,500
router at Best Buy

132
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,700
it doesn't work or it's not secure I can

133
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,120
take it back to a Best Buy I'll get my

134
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,830
money back

135
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,810
it isn't up to them to go to their

136
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,820
supplier and get their money back and so

137
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,380
on up the chain so you know if that

138
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,419
security vulnerability happens to be

139
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,500
somewhere deep in the firmware then it

140
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:05,479
might have to go quite far out the

141
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,840
supply chain but but this kind of like a

142
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:13,640
tree diagram of blame essentially so it

143
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:16,489
mean it all rolls uphill so one of the

144
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:18,260
things that I would like to see is

145
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:21,500
greater accountability across the

146
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:25,130
ecosystem so not just all the way to the

147
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,620
the final of the final OEM of a given

148
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:29,810
product

149
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:33,320
requiring that amount of security

150
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:34,540
certification really stifles innovation

151
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:38,040
in the industry

152
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:40,540
because you have to have security

153
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:43,840
expertise in a very in a lot of very

154
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:47,080
niche areas applied to every

155
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,690
manufacturer of every product if you

156
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:53,710
look at some in like you know typical

157
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:56,140
like food safety regulation the someone

158
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:58,419
who opens up a bakery is not responsible

159
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:01,810
for determining the safety of the flower

160
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:04,480
the the safety of the eggs the safety of

161
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:07,420
the milk instead they rely on existing

162
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,610
sets of certifications and regulations

163
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:11,530
about how those things are handled until

164
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,000
they get to the bakery and then of

165
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:15,400
course they're responsible for safe

166
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,670
handling of it to the final product so

167
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:21,010
if I send correctly you are suggesting

168
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:23,050
that the Sibylla intermediate

169
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:26,230
substitution component level that might

170
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:27,780
help in spreading the risk towards the

171
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:31,570
change this correct my understanding

172
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:35,109
absolutely okay great Roberto are you

173
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:37,210
same page I am the same page in fact as

174
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:39,580
you said of course if I buy something

175
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:42,130
like a smartphone from a particular

176
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:44,650
manufacturer that's the first place

177
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:48,400
where I go if I have a problem of any

178
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:51,239
kind not only security but it's

179
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,270
basically interface the first interface

180
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,740
for addressing these problems

181
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:59,260
responsibility of course is something

182
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,300
different I mean it might be for

183
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,830
instance there's a security problem that

184
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,350
isn't the modem they used and they're

185
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:08,710
not the developers of this model or

186
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:12,400
whatever whatever the component is so as

187
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:17,640
I said of course we then one has to be

188
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:21,630
able to go back and find in a clear way

189
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:23,710
where the security issue originated so

190
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:26,200
and that's actually responsibility to

191
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:28,960
think you are you are you are talking

192
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:31,330
about and of course that's also the path

193
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,120
that is important if regulators and

194
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:35,409
organizations need them to intervene to

195
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,900
address these issues

196
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:40,750
yeah it's also we're saying that the OEM

197
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:45,189
also takes the the initial bad press and

198
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:46,960
blame for everything in the end so these

199
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,510
also need to be understood and is not

200
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,269
risk

201
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:53,480
and Stephanie want to yeah actually

202
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:55,730
there's there's one thing that comes to

203
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,829
mind about this and an example that

204
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:00,680
comes to mind for me at least is not

205
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:03,380
really consumed you know cheap consumer

206
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:07,489
level example but the automotive

207
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:11,260
industry and there you have a very clear

208
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:15,920
picture of this because you have your

209
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:18,680
average car owner takes it up with the

210
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,680
manufacturer for whatever from defects

211
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,660
to vulnerabilities to whatever else that

212
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,870
the manufacturer is their interface of

213
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:28,550
course and the manufacturers have had an

214
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,709
interesting conundrum in these years

215
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:33,709
because on the one hand they've wanted

216
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:35,510
to push their security needs towards the

217
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:38,630
tier ones and throughout the supply

218
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:42,470
chain and on the other hand they found

219
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:44,720
out much to their dismay that they

220
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:46,490
couldn't because of course security is a

221
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,010
systemic issue right it's the final

222
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,779
integrator that that needs to figure out

223
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:53,540
how the different pieces fit together

224
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:56,810
they can push the words that their tier

225
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:58,969
ones security requirements but they need

226
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:01,430
to figure out a way to do to do it which

227
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:03,319
is not that easy if you think about it

228
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:06,849
writing the specs for an automotive

229
00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:09,889
component and including security specs

230
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:11,750
absolutely not easy I have seen tests

231
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:12,980
where basically the OEM would say oh

232
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:17,510
okay

233
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:19,430
Tier one create for me a head unit the

234
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:21,380
team's secure and the tier one would

235
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:25,729
come up with a unit to say here this is

236
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:27,790
perfectly okay and because secure does

237
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:31,250
not mean anything unless you specify

238
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:32,899
what you actually wanted to do or not do

239
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:35,779
or accept or not accept what is the

240
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:38,510
context so what you tested that head

241
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:40,579
unit which is perfectly well done in the

242
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,899
context of the vehicle it actually

243
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:44,300
doesn't work as intended

244
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:46,220
so um yeah that's that's the issue that

245
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:48,649
I see with breaking down the

246
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,899
certification process and and sending it

247
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:52,550
throughout the supply chain it's it's

248
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:55,310
actually something that is easy to

249
00:10:52,550 --> 00:11:00,930
imagine but very difficult to write down

250
00:10:55,310 --> 00:11:02,640
aspects yep so this dolefully means that

251
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:05,729
the OEMs will need to take the blame for

252
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:08,550
quite a bit of time but also is in many

253
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:11,370
situation it is also the the party that

254
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:13,740
takes the least margin along the chain

255
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:15,630
usually the to March in actually

256
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,520
diminishes along the chain until the

257
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:19,250
rival to the UM so basically will be in

258
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:22,709
the situation where you have one that

259
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:25,110
earns the list takes the blame but also

260
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:27,569
needs to take the responsibility for

261
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:31,110
safety justifying the device so how much

262
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:33,390
can you afford at that point to test

263
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,640
securely something it shouldn't be

264
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,779
something that we need to take into

265
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:41,459
consideration if you really want to have

266
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:43,560
secure devices yeah I mean the cost of

267
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:44,760
of the security eventually is going to

268
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:48,000
be passed on to the consumer there's no

269
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:50,130
way around that but but fundamentally

270
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,570
you have a chain of suppliers if you're

271
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:53,760
requiring that your suppliers give you

272
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,200
secure firmware and secure soces then

273
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,850
you need to make sure that that's in

274
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,560
your contracts with them so if you do

275
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,149
have a defect then it's on them to fix

276
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,010
it so you should have a contractual

277
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:03,060
obligation to roll that up he'll do you

278
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:06,120
think they are there this contact

279
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:07,619
obligation already it's there for some

280
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,270
things like safety and quality but

281
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,580
security is often overlooked in my

282
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,060
experience yeah Corey what did you

283
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,100
experience

284
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:17,459
Google Nest I mean do you have this kind

285
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:19,410
of agreement as well with parties up the

286
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:21,599
chain terms of responsibilities if you

287
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:23,910
want to share of course so we definitely

288
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,390
have certain specifications that we

289
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:29,610
provide to our suppliers to ensure

290
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:32,100
certain levels of security and and that

291
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:33,839
in if the product is not delivered

292
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:37,290
within those operational requirements

293
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:41,730
there are of course penalties and such

294
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:43,439
for that so I think it goes down a

295
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,420
little bit to what Stefano was saying

296
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,910
was is that you have to make sure that

297
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:50,060
the the recipe that you're building I'm

298
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:54,660
sorry I'm gonna be on a bakery and a

299
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:56,489
tilt today is actually something that's

300
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:59,339
sound in the first place because

301
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:04,320
otherwise you could you could still do

302
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:05,970
unsafe things so they we try to make

303
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,690
sure that

304
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:13,440
that the cost is appropriately balanced

305
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:15,330
yeah Stefan Alberto into this question

306
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,600
then should we find a way of pushing the

307
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:20,100
frets model or either down or absorb a

308
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,450
more understanding of the fat model

309
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,970
because that should be a way of saying

310
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:25,350
hey I want to have a product is more or

311
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,880
less it can be tested alone this

312
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:29,370
condition would that make sense would it

313
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,850
help in a way to build the product for

314
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:32,010
example

315
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:35,190
so what Stefan said of course that

316
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:37,410
security is a completely empty word if

317
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:39,420
we don't define against or what we're

318
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:43,500
defending against so we need a threat

319
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:46,709
model first as also you mentioned so

320
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:49,710
that's why it is very important that any

321
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:53,270
such process begins with a precise and

322
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:55,920
complete threat model and then you

323
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:59,610
derive from these the requirements for

324
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:03,300
each and every component you're going to

325
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:07,230
source and so you're going also to to

326
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:08,729
ask these and in a provable way from

327
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:13,230
from the people you are buying

328
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:19,400
components from if this is not done in a

329
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:23,730
very rigorous way then we always be

330
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:26,010
holes in the system and we know that a

331
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:30,000
chain is only as strong as the weakest

332
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:32,730
link and if and we can't afford this

333
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,520
especially now that the stakes are

334
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:40,140
getting higher with security being very

335
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:44,430
tightly bound also with safety and I'm

336
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:46,830
in a car a car is a smartphone with

337
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:53,790
wheels that that waits at least one tone

338
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:55,440
it can become a killing thing say we

339
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:58,560
really need to step up these efforts and

340
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:03,180
so they have to be very precisely bound

341
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:05,640
in contractual obligations so the

342
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:08,370
contract should include these things and

343
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:12,180
of course I mean if then the suppliers

344
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:16,080
further outsource then we will have to

345
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:18,739
request that they request the same from

346
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,740
their own suppliers

347
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:25,660
yeah it's so the complex part is yes of

348
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:29,139
course the threat model needs to be

349
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:31,509
passed down but the threat model changes

350
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:35,230
right why when you break it down it

351
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:37,209
changes form so it's actually a thing

352
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:38,949
that I have devoted some thought to and

353
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:40,479
I'm happy that it actually kind of

354
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:42,069
emerges every time that there's this

355
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,019
discussion because it means that I'm not

356
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:49,149
completely crazy I'm crazy but not that

357
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:52,709
completely crazy and it's and it's

358
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:54,639
actually a very complex thing to do

359
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:57,069
intellectually if you want to generalize

360
00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:00,100
this it's a very complex thing to do and

361
00:15:57,069 --> 00:16:03,069
I don't think that in at least in the

362
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:06,939
industries that I have looked at there

363
00:16:03,069 --> 00:16:09,420
is there is a neither a good process to

364
00:16:06,939 --> 00:16:14,079
do this or good tools to support this

365
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:17,279
threat model specific in specs in the

366
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:21,099
automotive world are passed down in the

367
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:23,740
glorious format of Docs documents like

368
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,540
Word documents and they are archived

369
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:28,990
they share folders that's that the

370
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:30,759
entire management system for these

371
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:33,249
things so when you change the vehicle

372
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:36,429
you basically copy the folder and try to

373
00:16:33,249 --> 00:16:38,499
edit the specs so it's it's it's

374
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:40,629
actually amazing to me that cars

375
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:42,999
actually move around on the roads and do

376
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:44,410
not fall apart right there well but he's

377
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:45,910
saying that we are the only one that are

378
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:47,889
getting older but not the systems

379
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:49,749
they're still there the systems are

380
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:50,470
still exactly the same as they were like

381
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:52,389
20 years ago

382
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:54,490
impressive that's just an additional

383
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:55,660
note about the threat modeling is you

384
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:57,759
know I can have a general-purpose

385
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:59,319
microcontroller and if I put that into

386
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,490
an Ikea light bulb that's a vastly

387
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:02,019
different threat model that if I put

388
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:04,209
that exact same component into like a

389
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:05,740
military jet and so when you have a

390
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:06,970
platform provider and we work with a lot

391
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,980
of chip vendors and when they're

392
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:10,120
creating a general thing the threat

393
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,039
model that they're building that to you

394
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:13,448
has to support the whole spectrum of

395
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:14,679
what the end product is going to be and

396
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,640
that's not always predictable you don't

397
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:17,529
know what people are going to create

398
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,089
with it no that's why your questions

399
00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:22,898
also if we shouldn't think of pushing

400
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:25,178
that up such as that the final om says

401
00:17:22,898 --> 00:17:27,369
hi need this kind of device over for

402
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:29,289
this purposes can you give me let's say

403
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:31,559
a component that has been either

404
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:34,259
engineer or design of test

405
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:36,240
along this the guidelines or not can I

406
00:17:34,259 --> 00:17:39,350
raise the point that we'll meet is even

407
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:42,570
more complex because of course I mean

408
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:47,248
that makes raising complex questions

409
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:50,370
that cannot be answered actually it's

410
00:17:47,249 --> 00:17:53,759
one step further because the the very

411
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:56,209
same final product can have different

412
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:59,220
threat models if you pick up the same

413
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:03,120
Volvo with the same self driving teeth

414
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:06,330
by Auto and it's sold to a consumer or

415
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,789
it's sold to a city for the ride sharing

416
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:11,549
system or it's sold to over for the

417
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:14,429
fleet the threat model for that because

418
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:17,100
is completely different and it's the

419
00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:20,009
same product so what threat model do we

420
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,869
do we test it against if we want to run

421
00:18:20,009 --> 00:18:24,600
certification it's it's actually a very

422
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:27,029
significant problem with security it's

423
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,889
not it's not uncommon that you have that

424
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:31,799
very specific product is certified for

425
00:18:28,889 --> 00:18:33,330
some use cases and not for other ones so

426
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:36,119
that would be just not an exception and

427
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:40,070
I think the process is for handling

428
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:40,070
different scenarios are already in place

429
00:18:41,149 --> 00:18:46,799
layer of complexity on top of the

430
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,779
product versus the components it's also

431
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,629
the product in which configuration and

432
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:55,379
for which use which is an additional

433
00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:59,189
layer great so but does this make all

434
00:18:55,379 --> 00:19:01,789
these many people request a

435
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:04,590
certification to be mandated by

436
00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:06,330
government regulatory framework they

437
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:08,789
yeah we need to do something this must

438
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:10,199
be one dated that's it is it even

439
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:12,149
possible to mandate something that we

440
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,759
don't understand my question

441
00:19:12,149 --> 00:19:18,299
I mean what do we want to mandate our

442
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:20,369
wouldn't be better that maybe when

443
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:22,529
instead of mandating something we make

444
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:24,299
desirable such as the security becomes a

445
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:27,059
bit of the value according to the chain

446
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:29,369
along the chain rather than just Monday

447
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:30,779
in that I'm just being able froggit of

448
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:32,490
and I'm pretty sure that people have

449
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:34,919
very different views also in the

450
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:36,389
audience so my view on on most security

451
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:37,679
certifications is that they don't tell

452
00:19:36,389 --> 00:19:38,939
you what you have to do to make your

453
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,559
products secure they tell you what you

454
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,840
should avoid doing to make it insecure

455
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,340
and so it's kind of a minimum bar if you

456
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,299
do everything correctly if you set your

457
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,220
bar as high as you can

458
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:49,139
and then getting these certifications is

459
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,789
mostly just documentation exercise to

460
00:19:49,139 --> 00:19:52,168
take your your existing requirements and

461
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:54,330
then putting that in whatever form the

462
00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:56,850
framework requires it to be documented

463
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:58,289
under because they're almost always a

464
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:00,209
lower bar then you should have set for

465
00:19:58,289 --> 00:20:02,549
yourself where we run into problems is

466
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:03,659
where its compliance driven and people

467
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:05,190
are like well I just need to get this

468
00:20:03,659 --> 00:20:07,080
certified so I can sell an extra hundred

469
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:08,129
thousand units and I'm and but they

470
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,720
haven't done any of the groundwork to

471
00:20:08,129 --> 00:20:12,029
make a secure product to begin with and

472
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,549
so now it's a how do I raise myself to

473
00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:15,960
that low bar but if you're just trying

474
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:17,220
to document a low bar when you've

475
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:21,899
already got a high bar it should be much

476
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:26,269
easier so in economics there's the

477
00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:29,969
concept of the market for lemons which

478
00:20:26,269 --> 00:20:32,730
you might have heard of where on where

479
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:35,369
you have a bunch of for example used

480
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:36,989
cars that they're all and they're

481
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:39,840
because several of them may end up being

482
00:20:36,989 --> 00:20:41,909
lemons that you as a consumer I don't

483
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,439
want can't inspect it you can't look

484
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:46,019
under the hood you can't figure it out

485
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:49,350
and so the price that you'll pay for any

486
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:51,239
given car is very low because you're

487
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:54,840
because you're assuming that you might

488
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:56,940
get a lemon and as a result and it

489
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,970
happens when you have this asymmetry of

490
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:02,009
information is that a consumer today

491
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:05,009
cannot look at a bunch of different

492
00:21:02,009 --> 00:21:06,869
devices and say okay I think that one's

493
00:21:05,009 --> 00:21:10,109
more secure than that one they rely on

494
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:14,249
things such as brand and experience with

495
00:21:10,109 --> 00:21:17,009
a particular company rather than having

496
00:21:14,249 --> 00:21:20,399
any type of independent meaningful

497
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:23,309
certification and so the problem is is

498
00:21:20,399 --> 00:21:27,029
that you'd end up when you do actually

499
00:21:23,309 --> 00:21:31,710
document the kind of what that baseline

500
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:35,519
is it does have an adverse effect on on

501
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:38,309
the market because it forces people to

502
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:40,460
kind of align to that standard and you

503
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:43,139
better have a good one because otherwise

504
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:46,379
what you end up with is that you see as

505
00:21:43,139 --> 00:21:51,238
Rob said a compliance based exercise and

506
00:21:46,379 --> 00:21:52,799
a race to the bottom so the I think what

507
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:55,139
we've seen with other types of

508
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:58,129
certifications whether it be you know

509
00:21:55,139 --> 00:22:02,840
PCI I think is a good example in the

510
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:04,780
payment card industry where you you end

511
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:07,730
up playing a lot of certification games

512
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:09,350
and in fact the first few version of the

513
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:14,210
standard failed because it was self

514
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:16,149
attestation and so it became a pretty

515
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:18,980
much a race to the bottom the determine

516
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:21,400
how payment card data it would be

517
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:25,700
secured so I gotta be careful about that

518
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:28,370
thank you anybody to add on this topic I

519
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:32,840
just wanted to add that there's a

520
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:37,010
there's also really a word we about you

521
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:40,490
problem here so you have the American

522
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:42,560
worldview where which is summed up by

523
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:44,450
the traditional saying that the scariest

524
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,790
phrase in the English language is we are

525
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:48,770
the government we are here to help so

526
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:50,389
that's that's the American view and that

527
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:52,160
there's the European view which is

528
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:54,350
embodied by the European Commission and

529
00:22:52,160 --> 00:23:00,530
it's rust I should not talk about that

530
00:22:54,350 --> 00:23:04,070
any further the when it can be mandated

531
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:07,760
in fact it's it's actually well well

532
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:11,870
underway to become a mandatory structure

533
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:14,870
for some fields the question is should

534
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:17,750
it and the second question is what

535
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:21,020
should be mandated now specifically

536
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:23,600
regarding that I would like to point out

537
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:25,460
that the cybersecurity Act which has

538
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,770
been enacted by the European Commission

539
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:30,080
and the Parliament as one of the last

540
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:32,600
acts of the previous Commission is now

541
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,250
now it's the the whole process is

542
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:37,159
stopped for a while while the new

543
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:41,450
Commission was formed but over the next

544
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:43,970
year earrings and requests for comments

545
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:46,910
are going to go out for the start of the

546
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:49,190
creation of the certification criteria

547
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:51,260
for the cybersecurity act if you have

548
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:56,300
not read it it's probably it's probably

549
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:58,430
better for you but the TLDR of the of

550
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:00,100
the cybersecurity act is that the

551
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:05,240
European Commission among other things

552
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:07,429
has decided to create a set of shall we

553
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,620
say industry specific or vertical

554
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:12,220
specific certifications to

555
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:16,669
the final a later stage two other acts

556
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:19,580
that will apply across the European

557
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:23,630
market so that they are that they are

558
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:27,050
common and in the next couple of years

559
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:30,650
these certification schemes are going to

560
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:33,320
be created and one thing that usually

561
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:34,880
happens is that when I go and work in

562
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:38,030
one of these bodies that are creating

563
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:40,670
certification schemes for the you so for

564
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:43,190
instance in the latest exercise where I

565
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:48,110
was talking about the cybersecurity of

566
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:51,230
medical of medical devices there were

567
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:55,189
about 30 people in the room very good

568
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:57,410
people by the way but very very focused

569
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:58,910
very determined to create something that

570
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:01,820
actually worked it was a pleasant

571
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:03,679
experience but there were Chu people

572
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:08,510
with a background in penetration testing

573
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:10,040
out of 30 and by chance because one of

574
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:12,470
these people was a representative of

575
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:15,170
standards body that happened to be from

576
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:17,450
us a penetration testing shop and I was

577
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:21,500
an academic that happened to have a past

578
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:22,070
as a penetration tester so that was just

579
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:26,179
by chance

580
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:29,510
so when you see pass by holes by Aneesa

581
00:25:26,179 --> 00:25:31,220
or by the european commission to enter

582
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:34,520
these interest groups or stakeholders

583
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:39,290
group do not ignore them because we as a

584
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:41,540
community ignore them at our peril Nick

585
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:43,639
I just like to pick up on something Cory

586
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,590
said I'm slightly more optimistic about

587
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,420
the the race to the bottom because I

588
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:50,840
think I think we're already at a bottom

589
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:52,850
and what we're seeing now is Europe is

590
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,990
working on some standards the US has

591
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:56,240
already passed laws in a couple of

592
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:58,400
states California and Oregon the UK

593
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,200
Canada they're investigating setting

594
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,880
some minimum floor and right now there

595
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,980
is no floor so you can make devices as

596
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,750
terrible as you want and sell them and

597
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:08,210
we're seeing that that lower bar being

598
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,809
raised at least to some minimum it's not

599
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:10,760
where it should be

600
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:13,428
I agree but but it's at least a start in

601
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:15,740
the right direction so to say these and

602
00:26:13,429 --> 00:26:18,140
the body wants a certification process

603
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:21,620
is too heavy also because it's always

604
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:22,559
expensive so when you have to abide it

605
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:25,320
some rules

606
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:28,168
and and you have to follow some

607
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,730
processes and you have to repeat them

608
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:32,309
for each iteration and that might

609
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:35,820
include the software then the cost costs

610
00:26:32,309 --> 00:26:37,889
can easily ramp up so there is a need

611
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:42,809
for the right balance of what you are

612
00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:46,019
requiring and so that is that you

613
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:49,860
actually have to hurt companies that do

614
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:54,240
gravy mistakes in security especially by

615
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:56,789
intentional inaction to hurt well where

616
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,309
where it hurts so in the pocket so there

617
00:26:56,789 --> 00:27:03,080
might be a system of fines you don't

618
00:26:59,309 --> 00:27:06,559
have to start hurting companies before

619
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:09,928
otherwise they they might even problems

620
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:12,840
entering entering the market so whereas

621
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:15,899
we do need certification and it must

622
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:20,789
address a good baseline not just the

623
00:27:15,899 --> 00:27:23,610
bottom and I think that's a given it's

624
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:28,408
up to the people setting this process in

625
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:32,668
place to make sure that actually the

626
00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:37,950
good work is rewarded and intentional

627
00:27:32,669 --> 00:27:39,899
sloppiness is severely that yeah it's

628
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:41,129
interesting to see that at the same time

629
00:27:39,899 --> 00:27:45,268
there were several initiatives which

630
00:27:41,129 --> 00:27:47,070
been initialized many some countries

631
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:51,840
already talking about mandating

632
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:54,269
regulation arm as a PSA certification

633
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,789
will it be mandated at some point in

634
00:27:54,269 --> 00:28:00,269
time will be always voluntary basis for

635
00:27:56,789 --> 00:28:05,820
your customers as far as you know so I

636
00:28:00,269 --> 00:28:07,619
don't know exactly but I usually when we

637
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:11,009
require something it is in the contract

638
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:14,369
so okay not doing what we required

639
00:28:11,009 --> 00:28:16,830
basically is a violation of the contract

640
00:28:14,369 --> 00:28:20,039
now I'm not illegal so I do not know

641
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:23,490
this rewarding and I shall never speak

642
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:25,549
yeah yeah I'm teaching you what I know

643
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:28,259
you are doing anyway there are different

644
00:28:25,549 --> 00:28:30,860
profiles you know it's a word I don't

645
00:28:28,259 --> 00:28:30,860
like very much

646
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:41,850
and there will be a process by which you

647
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:44,820
you get very specific certification yeah

648
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:47,610
for the usage of the PC components yeah

649
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:49,110
last question on this topic it's

650
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:51,209
interesting that basically it's been

651
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:53,459
done this year right after let's say I

652
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:55,409
have a created by a microcredit for

653
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:57,240
attack with meltdowns back trail all

654
00:28:55,409 --> 00:28:59,490
these things how much have they had a

655
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:02,480
role in creating a certification for our

656
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:04,889
Manila is if any at all to have seen any

657
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,679
concern growing and maybe we need to

658
00:29:04,889 --> 00:29:11,309
either in effect between these two

659
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:13,169
things yes no that is definitely a big

660
00:29:11,309 --> 00:29:14,370
factor but you know what there is one

661
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:17,039
thing actually now that you have to

662
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:20,189
understand it is a very British academic

663
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:23,519
culture so everything is debated until

664
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:28,049
everybody is sick of these and then you

665
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:30,690
continue as if getting sick in debates

666
00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:34,740
is a kind of a virtue or a kind of an

667
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:40,799
internal sport activity discussions

668
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:44,330
about adding security Processing's we're

669
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:46,830
definitely accelerated by this yeah and

670
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:49,980
well it was also one of the reasons I'm

671
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:52,379
actually having a little team I'm not

672
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:55,260
doing him I work alone that has

673
00:29:52,380 --> 00:30:00,830
definitely helped at least avoiding

674
00:29:55,260 --> 00:30:00,830
burnout in my case or delaying in time

675
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:08,610
but we also learned from from the past I

676
00:30:06,269 --> 00:30:11,070
don't want to use the word mistakes but

677
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:16,049
I mean sir what you observed is that

678
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:18,779
when we introduced trust zone we

679
00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:21,870
basically told the partners hey this is

680
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:24,000
a new hardware enforced bit that's how

681
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:26,129
it works that's how it separates the

682
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,029
resources from the non-secure world to

683
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:33,059
the world it is not no secure that's

684
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:36,299
that's the reason for the weird meaning

685
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:39,029
of the NS beats and but then everybody

686
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:40,549
was using this harder to implement their

687
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:43,289
own

688
00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:45,570
trusted education environment and many

689
00:30:43,289 --> 00:30:47,999
been broken and that the somewhat time

690
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:50,639
the reputation or what is actually a

691
00:30:47,999 --> 00:30:54,259
perfectly fine harbor architecture so

692
00:30:50,639 --> 00:30:57,959
for the future we are thinking seriously

693
00:30:54,259 --> 00:31:00,230
that new security related features if

694
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:04,610
any I'm not announcing anything here

695
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:09,090
another thing I'm not allowed to sure

696
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:12,779
but if you will see a new security

697
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:16,189
related the features in in arm there

698
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:19,619
will be also some very strong

699
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:23,850
instructions for use for for the

700
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:26,369
partners yeah audience can you please

701
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:28,199
raise hands who thinks that the security

702
00:31:26,369 --> 00:31:30,449
vacation should be mandated by

703
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:35,249
government please raise hands who thinks

704
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:37,559
it's right approach okay I actually

705
00:31:35,249 --> 00:31:41,970
would have expected many more on the

706
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:44,309
controversial so do you have any say hot

707
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:45,600
questions on this topic or controversial

708
00:31:44,309 --> 00:31:49,350
questions I would like to call solar

709
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:55,980
panel on Monday D from government or by

710
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:58,830
other bodies seriously we still have a

711
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:00,749
few I just wanted to take two take two

712
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:03,949
take just that very agreement employee

713
00:32:00,749 --> 00:32:03,950
are you out of your mind

714
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:09,779
so it's recently come to my attention at

715
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:13,199
least in the United States certain

716
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:16,499
certifications actually force companies

717
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:19,679
not to open their source or designs and

718
00:32:16,499 --> 00:32:20,850
I'm kind of worried that having the

719
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,740
wrong people in charge of these

720
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:26,908
certifications might lead to similar

721
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:29,490
things happening here because at least

722
00:32:26,909 --> 00:32:31,889
outside of if basic security a lot of

723
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:33,929
people tend to think that sharing your

724
00:32:31,889 --> 00:32:36,889
designs will make it easier for people

725
00:32:33,929 --> 00:32:43,850
to find problems and just less secure

726
00:32:36,889 --> 00:32:46,019
are like you know any like way how to

727
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:49,019
guard against these kind of things

728
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:51,119
because so I mean there's kind of two

729
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:53,799
distinct questions there that I see what

730
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:55,689
one is you know should we like

731
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:56,799
governments decide things and the

732
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:58,149
question is which government because

733
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,158
there's definitely ones that might rust

734
00:32:58,149 --> 00:33:04,658
and ones that I don't and that that's a

735
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:06,820
huge debate in itself in I lost track of

736
00:33:04,659 --> 00:33:10,419
the second question though sorry

737
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:12,428
oh yes that so that yeah the obfuscation

738
00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:14,860
essentially like security through

739
00:33:12,429 --> 00:33:16,899
obscurity is another debate that that's

740
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:18,039
been widely debated and I think I fall

741
00:33:16,899 --> 00:33:19,449
on the side of the fence where it

742
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:21,700
doesn't really buy you much it buys you

743
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:24,999
time but but the bugs will come out

744
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:27,070
eventually so yeah that's exactly what

745
00:33:24,999 --> 00:33:28,239
was saying it was kind of afraid that it

746
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:30,100
might lead to more security for

747
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:32,649
obscurity and therefore actually less

748
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:36,459
secure role so I mean there's a few

749
00:33:32,649 --> 00:33:38,949
aspects of that you know being part of

750
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:42,190
the product security team now for many

751
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:44,109
many years is is that there I've learned

752
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:46,149
that there's a significant impact of

753
00:33:44,109 --> 00:33:48,539
kind of this hype cycle that gets

754
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:53,549
generated by this disclosure of

755
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:56,710
vulnerabilities or security issues that

756
00:33:53,549 --> 00:33:59,200
pick up a large amount of press that

757
00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:01,539
then cycle into government calls for

758
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:06,399
action that then fall you know kind of

759
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:08,918
follow this cycle and so I there there

760
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:12,609
is always the concern that if you are

761
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:17,219
more transparent then you might invite

762
00:34:12,609 --> 00:34:20,918
more research or more involvement in

763
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:23,020
discussions about your about your

764
00:34:20,918 --> 00:34:24,699
product so and you actually as someone

765
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:27,190
who's just cares about the end result of

766
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:28,899
how secure your products are you want

767
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:31,210
that discussion you want that that

768
00:34:28,899 --> 00:34:36,460
transparency but the problem is is that

769
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:39,899
if if if the government regulations are

770
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:45,369
fueled by a press cycle fuel fueled by

771
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:47,379
like noisy security researchers that may

772
00:34:45,369 --> 00:34:49,750
not have necessarily add all the

773
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:52,719
necessary context into what they've

774
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:55,960
discovered and found you end up with

775
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:58,839
people being gun-shy but I you know I

776
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:00,910
believe that transparency is a critical

777
00:34:58,839 --> 00:35:03,578
component to making sure that you're

778
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:05,040
you're secure yeah this question we are

779
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:07,240
really approaching in the last few

780
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,790
moments

781
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:12,129
one question interesting will be we keep

782
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:13,750
on that's asking to test devices right

783
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:15,370
one while we know that when you test a

784
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:17,740
device you find some vulnerabilities

785
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:19,330
then they actually they get fixed and in

786
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:21,189
the end sooner or later they should be

787
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:23,200
certified well we know that for a

788
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:25,720
positive cycle the actually the process

789
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,279
in the manufacturer are actually even

790
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:31,180
more important do we actually perform

791
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:33,460
review of your code or your design do we

792
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:35,940
actually perform external audits how

793
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:38,050
often do you have a program for

794
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:40,020
answering to vulnerabilities and a

795
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:43,120
commitment to patch within 30 days

796
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:45,700
finally do you commit to keep the device

797
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:47,500
patched for next five years so these are

798
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:49,899
processes which are went otherwise and

799
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:51,910
are not that device wise why don't we

800
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,740
consider rather than testing all devices

801
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:55,930
certifying all the also the vendors

802
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:57,819
processes because so knowing that the

803
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:59,770
vendor actually has this processes makes

804
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:01,870
all the device or the vendors even more

805
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:09,340
secure what do you think with a quick

806
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:11,529
round of an idea so I mean the answer is

807
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:13,120
yes all of those things need to be to be

808
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:14,380
audited to make sure that they're secure

809
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,270
the process is the manufacturing

810
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:18,730
patching and when you're doing a

811
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:20,740
holistic test of a device all of that is

812
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:21,940
in scope now the question is whether or

813
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,290
not the client is willing to pay for

814
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:25,090
that because maybe they didn't allocate

815
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:27,340
enough money for that sort of you know

816
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:29,170
hole hole test and we definitely see

817
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:30,940
that quite frequently where they just

818
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:32,980
want to get the bare minimum tests

819
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:45,400
that's just kind of a failure of

820
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:48,280
budgeting so I won't speak to any

821
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:50,890
particular process but I think one of

822
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:54,070
the things that we should think about is

823
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:58,359
even in like IOT or at least in my space

824
00:36:54,070 --> 00:37:01,870
and consumer hardware on that much still

825
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:03,610
most of the security critical controls

826
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:08,279
are in the service infrastructure layer

827
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:10,960
that drives that drives the hardware and

828
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:13,390
so when you look at the processes that

829
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,620
are used to maintain that that service

830
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:17,310
infrastructure or that cloud

831
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:20,069
infrastructure is actually

832
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:24,060
that's important of set of processes to

833
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:27,930
look at rather than just what you do on

834
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:30,960
the hardware side if you also about the

835
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:34,109
security processes I wonder and I am

836
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:37,380
asking myself and so backs Nations

837
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:42,270
everybody here whether we might need a

838
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:45,480
certification process for for the

839
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:48,660
security development lifecycle so a kind

840
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:50,340
of an ISO 9000 standard for security

841
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:52,230
processes we have them for safety we

842
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:53,930
have them for things even though there

843
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:56,070
is another risk because security

844
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:59,700
processes must be tailored order to the

845
00:37:56,070 --> 00:38:01,500
company culture I'm moving from Qualcomm

846
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:03,899
where there was a very specific culture

847
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:06,810
I see that things are different in arm

848
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:09,900
and I even though I'm part of the team

849
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:12,360
that is setting up an stl for arm

850
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:14,220
we can't just copy the other one because

851
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:16,260
the company culture is very different so

852
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:20,399
the risk with these certification this

853
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:23,510
case which is something unsplit would be

854
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:28,410
that it might try to impose a

855
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:31,620
methodology which is not the right one

856
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:34,410
for all the cultures and so this is this

857
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:37,319
is evenly like an open question for

858
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:42,120
everybody to think about they want to

859
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:44,730
think about more about 7 I just wanted

860
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:46,740
to point out - one thing that I think is

861
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:49,080
clear in everyone's mind in this

862
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:53,370
industry but it's not outside this

863
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:56,160
industry that we know that for instance

864
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:59,130
security assessment as as you said

865
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,629
before very well it's basically a

866
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:02,400
negative thing right you are looking at

867
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:05,370
things and trying to figure out what is

868
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,830
wrong and most of other certifications

869
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:10,770
like Electrical Safety or biomedical

870
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:12,509
safety they are instead be predicated on

871
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:16,890
fact that you can prescribe what what

872
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:19,740
you want the product to do so this

873
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:23,900
difference makes me think that actually

874
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:26,759
the point about we may be better off at

875
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:28,980
certifying some processes we've all the

876
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,900
caveat that you rightly pointed out we

877
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:32,690
need to make it

878
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:35,570
generally enough but we may be better at

879
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:40,280
figuring out the processes and giving

880
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:42,680
some prescriptions or some requirements

881
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:45,230
to need for the processes then we are at

882
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,819
giving out specific requirements for the

883
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:50,360
products it's precisely the same way

884
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:53,570
that ISO 27001 describes a process and

885
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:56,360
not the outcome all the technologists

886
00:39:53,570 --> 00:40:00,590
and I know that the simple mention of

887
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:02,450
ISO 27001 has created a vacuum in yeah

888
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:06,020
even in the moderator don't worry about

889
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:08,600
it in fact one thing that I really hate

890
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:11,150
our recipe is pieces people sometimes

891
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:13,610
ask me what are the things I have to do

892
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:16,700
in order to get something secure and

893
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:19,010
what I teach in my security risk

894
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:21,919
assessment clusters within the company

895
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:23,780
is essentially that the reason approach

896
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,120
of course we have to write documents in

897
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:29,150
a very specific way but you can't really

898
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:31,790
get the recipe so I always have a slide

899
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:33,830
because I'm an arrogant uno it so they

900
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:36,740
want to show off a culture with a quote

901
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:40,069
or from Machado that is coming on tip

902
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:41,060
and no high Comino hockey caminar Alain

903
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:45,650
de si si

904
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:48,710
El Camino which means Walker there is no

905
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:52,070
path the path is done so there is the

906
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:55,340
warning there is the and your path is

907
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:58,160
done by walking and very different

908
00:40:55,340 --> 00:41:00,890
products sometimes require you not to

909
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:04,190
bend the rules but to use them in a

910
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:08,450
different way and to sometimes find a

911
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:14,150
doc mental approaches to to test

912
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:17,660
something it's very risky we might need

913
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:20,840
something but we're on the same line I'm

914
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:24,080
glad this is sparkling some sparking

915
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:26,180
some thoughts they find constructive L

916
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:28,190
so not very often discussed at this

917
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:30,859
level because very often when you

918
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:33,020
discuss about certification is a there

919
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:34,640
are many technical details of one

920
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:37,910
certification or another if these are

921
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,350
general problems in order to close a not

922
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:41,240
so controversial but very interesting

923
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:43,490
and so finally the last question

924
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:46,399
basically what are your

925
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:49,669
and owns very quickly of certification

926
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,380
so what in your view must be there and

927
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:54,170
must not be there in a given

928
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:56,420
certification quickly so one of the

929
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:58,910
things that that I see our most security

930
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:00,350
successful customers doing it is they

931
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:01,970
don't they're not interested in the bugs

932
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:03,290
if we find a bunch of bugs that we think

933
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:05,359
that's cool but what are the patterns

934
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:07,610
you know if we see these kinds of bugs

935
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,930
let's go find variants of that and so

936
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:10,940
they'll actually go variant hunting on

937
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:13,220
every kind of bug and it's that maturity

938
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:14,480
that that the big security organizations

939
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:16,580
have we're gonna actually go and hunt

940
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,230
down all of the patterns and that that

941
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:19,850
by and large like squashes entire

942
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:21,800
classes of issues and that's far more

943
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:27,589
successful than just hitting the ones

944
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:29,060
used I have to do self-regulate our

945
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:30,830
industry needs to come up with

946
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:32,960
reasonable standards that we can offer

947
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:36,650
the government says hey this is this is

948
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:39,260
a reasonable standard because don't let

949
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:41,510
them regulate us because that's not

950
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:43,160
something we want with the obvious

951
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:45,080
exception of my employer that pays my

952
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:48,640
salary all governments are equally bad

953
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:53,779
at certifying things and mandating

954
00:42:48,640 --> 00:43:01,490
structures so I have one don't common

955
00:42:53,780 --> 00:43:06,530
criteria specifics don't come over here

956
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:10,700
is nice it's right after a quarry yes

957
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:13,400
episode do would be set an expiration

958
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:18,049
for any certification that exists faith

959
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:20,240
and don't would be self a test yep

960
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:22,190
well we already a few really a few hands

961
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,560
being raised for questions for one is

962
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:27,530
there come on now you're it's your time

963
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:30,860
blessed blast them I'd like to make a

964
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:32,210
comment on Barbados last comment I can

965
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:34,400
see why you don't want Common Criteria

966
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:37,490
to be mandated for other industries

967
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,620
because it's too complex and so on but

968
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:41,330
if you look at the tremendous success

969
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:43,520
and raising the security standard over

970
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:45,650
the past twenty years I think that's

971
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:49,070
something there's a good starting point

972
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:51,260
if you get it lean and then it's I would

973
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:53,360
say close to perfect because the smart

974
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:54,660
car industry continues to raise the

975
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:57,210
standards

976
00:43:54,660 --> 00:44:00,120
the past 20 years using a mechanism like

977
00:43:57,210 --> 00:44:01,380
Common Criteria is I know the main

978
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:05,640
problem with Common Criteria

979
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:09,630
is that it's too much reduced to a

980
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:12,359
checklist sometimes and the way it is

981
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:15,780
organized sometimes it scares people so

982
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:17,940
I don't want to require something using

983
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:20,910
a very specific language and then rigid

984
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:26,190
process by which the main reaction might

985
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:28,190
be they they might be even disturbed in

986
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:31,590
their own development by this and then

987
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:33,560
I've seen people just I'm not saying

988
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:38,430
that in a way when you mention the word

989
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:41,540
but you see that in the eyes and it's

990
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:46,830
also because yes you can just follow

991
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:49,440
step by step it gives you a baseline but

992
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:52,080
sadly it's not sufficient you're right

993
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,790
it's a starting point I think we can

994
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:57,900
also skip the starting point and start

995
00:44:53,790 --> 00:45:09,810
with something even better if you have

996
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:12,889
nothing else okay what do you mean maybe

997
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:12,889
[Music]

998
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:23,910
we can take one more question because we

999
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:25,470
are actually over time yeah so I was one

1000
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:28,770
of the few people who raised their hands

1001
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:32,279
when you asked whether government should

1002
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:34,620
be imposing security standards on

1003
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,840
businesses and one of the reasons for

1004
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:41,370
this is obviously I'm a bit more from a

1005
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:43,740
from the Harper field and there's within

1006
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:48,240
Europe there's the C II requirement this

1007
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:51,120
is a self-test mostly but within

1008
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,890
hardware this has created a lower bar

1009
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:55,230
which is actually significantly higher

1010
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:57,240
than what we've seen previously coming

1011
00:45:55,230 --> 00:46:00,350
in for instance over eBay and Aliexpress

1012
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:04,620
from China as far as Hardware goes and

1013
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:07,009
this has created these very common

1014
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:08,960
companies that

1015
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:11,750
do the certification for you that know

1016
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:14,690
exactly what they have to do to review

1017
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:20,810
your design to test your design against

1018
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:24,290
the relevant fields and this has become

1019
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:26,869
very affordable this is not just that

1020
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:29,029
I've heard you say it shouldn't become

1021
00:46:26,869 --> 00:46:30,320
like a checkbox feature not something

1022
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:32,119
that you just check off and then it's

1023
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:34,070
gone and you don't do a loss holistic

1024
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:36,740
design but those companies that are very

1025
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:38,630
specialized do actually do very

1026
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:42,080
comprehensive very realistic design

1027
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:45,170
reviews on your hardware of course and

1028
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:47,990
there are still affordable for a company

1029
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:51,200
without your company actually needing

1030
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:53,779
all this expertise in-house so from this

1031
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:56,299
perspective looking at it from a

1032
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:59,540
hardware point of view it seems to be

1033
00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:01,250
possibly effective so I'm so consciously

1034
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:03,320
optimizer your observation is accurate

1035
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:05,359
of course but I think I think it works

1036
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,619
best in a very narrow focus like when

1037
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:08,720
when you look at like Electrical Safety

1038
00:47:06,619 --> 00:47:10,880
for example they're concerned about the

1039
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:13,669
safety of the electrical equipment

1040
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:16,280
that's it whereas the things that we're

1041
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:18,410
talking about here are our generic and

1042
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:19,640
apply in so many different areas in so

1043
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:21,319
many different industries it's kind of

1044
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:27,020
hard to make one one safety or security

1045
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:28,849
standard but that applies well thank you

1046
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:32,060
very much also for is interaction our

1047
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:34,609
time is up so I would like to thank you

1048
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:36,619
for staying here the panel hope you

1049
00:47:34,609 --> 00:47:39,470
enjoyed and found it interesting of

1050
00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:42,710
course you can find ourself in the panel

1051
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:47,680
is just outside when we are finished

1052
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:47,680
well have a good continuation thank you
