1
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:08,410
good morning everyone good morning have

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:10,809
everybody's got any problems healing let

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:13,360
me know and I'll try and speak up later

4
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:15,338
but I'm sure that the audio is doing its

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,380
job here properly and I'll try to make

6
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:21,610
sure that I do mine and making sure that

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:24,310
were properly heard what I'd like to do

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:27,130
is to talk a little bit about the need

9
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:29,110
for a real hardware security and in this

10
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:31,780
case we're talking about the real hard

11
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:33,309
end of hardware security that's where we

12
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,980
actually go in and start digging into

13
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:37,599
things but digging into things on a

14
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:40,269
small scale which means that we're going

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,019
to be looking at how things work with

16
00:00:40,269 --> 00:00:46,539
focused ion beam at nanometer scale this

17
00:00:44,019 --> 00:00:48,309
is things to start why we need things

18
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:52,539
like hardware security in the first

19
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:54,940
place there are different elements to

20
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:57,579
security in this is always the software

21
00:00:54,940 --> 00:01:01,239
the firmware and the hardware side of

22
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:04,690
things and they all contribute to making

23
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:06,340
some systems secure but not only do they

24
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:10,990
all contribute to making sensitive

25
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:13,899
systems secure any one of them being

26
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:16,658
insecure can help a system to fall from

27
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:19,299
that level of security so we must make

28
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:22,509
sure that every system what we have has

29
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:24,310
good software firmware iearnt hardware

30
00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:28,030
and any one of those elements failing

31
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:29,439
can cause a problem now of course we're

32
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:32,170
going to be talking about the hardware

33
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,579
end of things here first of all in the

34
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:35,950
whole conference of course but

35
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:38,880
specifically in this talk as well so

36
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:43,149
it's very much in the hardware end and

37
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:47,740
we're also aware of that no matter what

38
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:50,979
we do ultimately everything could fail

39
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:53,350
in security our task is not necessarily

40
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:55,570
to make things absolutely secure we know

41
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:57,309
that we often can't do that it's just

42
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,919
there's got to be sufficiently secure

43
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:02,289
that it isn't worthwhile for people to

44
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,969
try to break that security that's a

45
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:06,249
difficult judgment to make but it's one

46
00:02:03,969 --> 00:02:08,350
that people have to sort of be aware of

47
00:02:06,249 --> 00:02:12,989
when they're trying to either secure

48
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:12,989
things or to hack into things

49
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,290
so what I'd like to think about now just

50
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:21,090
a little about what actually security

51
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,130
means in this and there are two cases

52
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:26,220
that we can think about there's one but

53
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:28,410
you have hard problems to solve in terms

54
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:31,380
of hardware security and the other thing

55
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,920
you have Hardware hardened problems to

56
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:36,390
solve

57
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:39,329
if you imagine a really complex chip the

58
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:41,670
kind of chip like a Pentium chip in a PC

59
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:44,400
or some cloud or one of the chips is

60
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:49,500
driving a mobile phone they are very

61
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:53,270
very complex and those chips have very

62
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:55,890
small geometries a huge number of of

63
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:58,050
circuit elements to them and they are

64
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:00,720
very hard to deal with because of their

65
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:03,090
complexity and that way we call them

66
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,560
hard but they are not specifically

67
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:09,870
hardened and really it's what you have

68
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,440
to deal with there is the complexity of

69
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:16,050
dealing with those systems on the other

70
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,240
end of things you have chips which might

71
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:23,670
because harden they're specifically made

72
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:27,110
secure but in many cases they're simpler

73
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:29,700
chips they usually don't have the same

74
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:32,700
geometry it's much larger geometries and

75
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:35,010
therefore easier to get to many fewer

76
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:38,579
components on them but they have very

77
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:39,989
specific hardware security components

78
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:43,320
that you have to get around and they're

79
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:44,700
made more difficult to get into so some

80
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,980
of you'll be working on one type of

81
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:50,609
product some type people were working on

82
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:53,010
other types of product and there are two

83
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:54,480
different types of ways of dealing and

84
00:03:53,010 --> 00:04:02,370
getting into those things in dealing

85
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:05,810
with them so in this case for us hard

86
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:08,820
hardened means that you have the

87
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:11,130
software and the firmware all this built

88
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:13,799
in now designed to stop attacks on the

89
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:15,840
system you have lots of things from

90
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,720
internal firewalling in such things

91
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,579
these are all the sorts of hardened

92
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,229
elements that go into making that system

93
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:26,639
you have specific features such as

94
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:28,919
random number generators true

95
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,879
number generators in there which are

96
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:36,270
elements are often not present in most

97
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:38,610
hard chips but are in the hardened level

98
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:41,430
of chips many other features in there

99
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:45,259
that are designed to be secure right

100
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:48,060
from the beginning and a lot of the test

101
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:50,310
functions in there such as JTAG and

102
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:53,310
other things like that have usually been

103
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:56,460
either completely removed or have been

104
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:59,639
made inaccessible by some means and if

105
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:02,188
we can try to sort of get into those

106
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:05,879
things again either be made inaccessible

107
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:10,379
that would be a big advantage someone

108
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:16,919
trying to break into that system in any

109
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:19,289
case this secure chip has been protected

110
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:22,650
against various forms of attack and it's

111
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:25,650
our job in some ways to assess that

112
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:27,210
protection or in other cases to break

113
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:31,770
through that protection and try to get

114
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:35,460
into it and some of the ways of doing

115
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:36,990
that your going to be key you could be

116
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,080
using probing to get into these things

117
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:42,319
try to find out what's going into them

118
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:45,810
you could try to rewire the circuit

119
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:48,509
change the layout of that circuit in

120
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:52,529
small ways to try to get things rushing

121
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:54,990
again to try to bring out new functions

122
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:57,180
to get working again that may have been

123
00:05:54,990 --> 00:06:00,599
disabled and you're going to be using

124
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:03,629
tools such as a focused ion beam system

125
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:06,330
to be able to do that and it's all about

126
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:08,909
changing that chip behavior from its

127
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:11,580
original intent to get it to do what you

128
00:06:08,909 --> 00:06:13,560
wanted to do rather than what the

129
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:16,258
designers and developers wanted it to do

130
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:20,669
and it's try to do that that's important

131
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:24,029
here so there's a probing systems you

132
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:26,938
can use for that and if you were to sort

133
00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:29,069
of rewire the circuit you can do things

134
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:30,960
here so this is a rather old circuit but

135
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:32,370
focused on being it's what we're going

136
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,258
to be concentrating on is how you can

137
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:35,879
put their new tracks such as that which

138
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:41,930
it was never intended there in the first

139
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:41,930
place or you can cut tracks such as that

140
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:50,570
it's an example of a focused ion beam

141
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:51,890
workstation so what actually is this

142
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:56,090
kind of tool that we're going to be

143
00:06:51,890 --> 00:07:00,710
talking about today so the first part is

144
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:01,640
that it's really a kind of microscope it

145
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,739
could have a number of different

146
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:07,490
elements to that microscope the first

147
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:10,400
thing is that it has an iron beam which

148
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:12,560
can be focused down to a small spot to

149
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:16,270
give you a relatively high resolution of

150
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,620
what you're looking at on that circuit a

151
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:22,580
typical resolution now is about five

152
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:26,090
nanometers so you can see down to

153
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:27,830
features that are really pretty much the

154
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:34,330
smallest features you can expect in any

155
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:37,849
circuits in addition you may have an

156
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:41,479
electron microscope and in some cases

157
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:44,090
they are quite far into the sub

158
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,070
nanometer range so you really can see

159
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,869
all the features you might expect even

160
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:51,590
on some of the seven nanometer circuits

161
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:55,250
are around today so you've got this very

162
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:57,440
very high resolution techniques to be

163
00:07:55,250 --> 00:08:01,070
able to see what's going on in those

164
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:03,710
circuits either in some of the rather

165
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:06,440
larger hardened circuits that we were

166
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:08,870
talking about earlier or even on the

167
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:12,530
hard circuits which have got much finer

168
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:14,830
and smaller geometries then we have been

169
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:17,390
used to in the past they're a long way

170
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:19,430
another thing that you may often have is

171
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:21,320
an infrared microscope attached onto

172
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:25,669
this thing which allows you to do

173
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:28,099
another kind of edit and change in these

174
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:31,340
circuits which is backside editing of

175
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:34,280
the circuit and infrared microscope

176
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:37,760
allows you to look through the silicon

177
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:41,120
substrate offered IC that means you're

178
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,210
looking at it from the bottom and there

179
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,340
are some big advantages to that as well

180
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:48,640
but there are also many disadvantages to

181
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:51,460
that too because there's a much more

182
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,170
complex and different technique to the

183
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:58,520
normal topside

184
00:08:54,170 --> 00:09:00,469
view from a focused ion beam system and

185
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,390
one looking why that's useful and

186
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:10,400
necessary in some of the difficulties

187
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:12,350
surrounding that another reason for

188
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,750
using a focused ion beam is it's not

189
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:21,020
only a microscope to see what's going on

190
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:24,650
there it's also our digging tool it uses

191
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:26,900
a gallium iron beam and that gallium

192
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:29,000
iron beam can focus down onto a spot and

193
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:32,720
when it hits it it can remove that

194
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,300
material through sputtering so you place

195
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:39,520
your beam on a spot maybe scan over a

196
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,520
small area and you spot a material away

197
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:47,030
and as you sputter you can also

198
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:49,490
introduce some gases as well and that

199
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:52,069
gas that you introduce could do things

200
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:55,100
like enhance certain milling of

201
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:58,610
materials so if you were to flood the

202
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:00,350
area with some xenon difluoride gas you

203
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:04,070
would enhance the milling of the

204
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:06,620
dielectrics within the circuit or if we

205
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:08,420
were to use iodine or chlorine gas you

206
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:12,250
will enhance the milling of aluminium

207
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:15,079
metals and there are the gases used for

208
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:16,760
enhancing or at least helping the

209
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,700
milling of copper materials if that's

210
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,830
the kind of circuit you have and you can

211
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:24,500
also use gases for being able to deposit

212
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:28,580
new tracks so be it

213
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:30,380
depositing something like tungsten or

214
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:33,110
platinum or something that you can use

215
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:35,540
gases which contain those elements those

216
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:38,420
materials to deposit new tracks in your

217
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:41,380
circuit so it's a digging tool and a

218
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:45,620
deposition tool as well as the

219
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:49,040
microscope that it it is and you can use

220
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:52,160
that deposition to add new circuit new

221
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,990
circuit tracks or new points such as

222
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,870
probe points where you can get in and

223
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:59,660
you measure things on a circuit so

224
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:02,810
that's why it's a fairly versatile tool

225
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:05,600
for getting into a circuit it gives you

226
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:08,268
the ability to get in there

227
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,670
make those changes to the behavior of

228
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:18,290
that chip that allows you to make that

229
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:20,990
attack and to assess its security so

230
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:22,910
let's stage isn't an attack the first

231
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:24,829
thing you have to decide is what are you

232
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:27,439
actually doing are you testing the

233
00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:29,569
security of the chip are you actually

234
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,930
the hacker trying to breach the security

235
00:11:29,569 --> 00:11:35,750
of that chip for your own aims or are

236
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:38,599
you the academic researching how that is

237
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:40,579
and though that category you put

238
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,050
yourself in determines your approach

239
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:46,638
you're going to be taking on some of

240
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:50,599
these things the next days you have to

241
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:52,100
find out what's there you won't be given

242
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,170
or at least you won't be given any

243
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,389
really important information about the

244
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:58,849
chip no matter who you are so you've got

245
00:11:56,389 --> 00:12:01,250
to get it for yourself you've got to be

246
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,449
able to get some documentation but

247
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,990
that's not going to give you an awful

248
00:12:02,449 --> 00:12:05,420
lot of help

249
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:07,069
the main way you're going to be able to

250
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:09,829
find out what's going on is by reverse

251
00:12:07,069 --> 00:12:13,399
engineering the chip you got to take it

252
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:15,138
apart are you good at then when you've

253
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:17,410
done that you've got to sort of examine

254
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:21,050
what you've done and taking it apart and

255
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:26,000
try to identify the weaknesses of that

256
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:30,410
chip in order to exploit them again it's

257
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,089
all to do with identifying what changes

258
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:36,469
you can make to the chip that allow you

259
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:38,779
to take control of it so in reverse

260
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:43,130
engineering you can see that you've got

261
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:45,170
to make a map of that chip this is just

262
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:47,420
a little cross-section of a chip that

263
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:50,689
you might see or all the one but you've

264
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:54,649
got to be able to get in to strip back

265
00:12:50,689 --> 00:12:58,730
that chip layer by layer there's a

266
00:12:54,649 --> 00:13:01,699
number of ways of doing that you can use

267
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:03,290
wet chemical etching you can remove some

268
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:07,160
of the dielectric layers of black

269
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:11,420
dielectric layers using materials like

270
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:13,010
HF acid hydrofluoric acid you can remove

271
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:17,079
the metals

272
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:19,459
such as the aluminium for example using

273
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:21,579
phosphoric acid based state cheese and

274
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:26,209
other things and there are other X's for

275
00:13:21,579 --> 00:13:28,099
copper based materials and you can use

276
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:30,290
wet chemical action to do that but it's

277
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:33,880
very hard because it's very difficult to

278
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:36,829
get a good uniform H on these things I

279
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:39,320
think probably more common common now is

280
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:40,790
the mechanical grinding and lapping

281
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:44,209
where you're polishing off these layers

282
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:46,490
are very fine slurry of usually diamond

283
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:47,869
to be able to remove those materials

284
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:50,810
then you come down layer by layer

285
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:54,380
exposing the different layers as you go

286
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:56,239
through it and another way of being able

287
00:13:54,380 --> 00:14:00,500
to do that is to use reactive ion

288
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:03,170
etching plasma etching to use a plasma

289
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:06,490
species of different gases to

290
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:08,630
selectively remove different materials

291
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:10,160
different gases will remove different

292
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:13,820
materials that they can go through the

293
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:16,579
structure layer by layer using any one

294
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:18,139
of those techniques or a combination of

295
00:14:16,579 --> 00:14:24,189
all those technique to be able to do

296
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:26,660
that once you've exposed a layer you

297
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:31,970
then have to somehow image that layer

298
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:35,029
get a view of the entire structure image

299
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:37,310
that layer and hopefully image the

300
00:14:35,029 --> 00:14:39,649
contacts between the layers as well as

301
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:41,869
the actual layers themselves to be able

302
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:45,230
to reconstruct a sort of

303
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:49,010
three-dimensional map of what you have

304
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:53,240
in each circuit and then you've got to

305
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:54,620
go through that somehow to identify what

306
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,540
is actually there

307
00:14:54,620 --> 00:15:00,850
seeing the structures is one thing

308
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:05,060
knowing what the structures are and

309
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:07,040
identifying what they do is in many ways

310
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:10,910
the most difficult problem of this whole

311
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:13,010
exercise so knowing what's now from a

312
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:15,680
functional point of view is a critical

313
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:17,569
thing now I know there was some at least

314
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,160
to some training yesterday worse and

315
00:15:17,569 --> 00:15:20,569
there was one group we were showing or

316
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,870
some very used software from being able

317
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:25,760
to do this sort of thing it's a it's

318
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,630
it's a difficult problem but it's one

319
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:33,110
that is no be

320
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:34,939
Souls okay so stripping back the layers

321
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,560
if you were to do this you can go

322
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,509
through earlier this is actually going

323
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,518
from the reverse direction normally as

324
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:42,139
you strip back you look at the top

325
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:44,389
layers first as you go through and you

326
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:46,370
go down through the stretch stack this

327
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:50,149
is what you might see right down at the

328
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:52,490
bottom poly-silicon right above the

329
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:53,750
silicon layer itself so the silicon are

330
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:56,569
these sort of gaps in the middle there

331
00:15:53,750 --> 00:16:00,800
are there's poly silicon layers as part

332
00:15:56,569 --> 00:16:03,680
of the the gate structures you'll find

333
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,120
in a logic area on a chip and as you go

334
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,729
up through there you have different

335
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,589
layers going through here so you've got

336
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:11,839
some power lines and ground lines here

337
00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:14,690
and lots of different circuit elements

338
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:19,550
in between what they are at the moment

339
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:21,680
isn't exactly obvious but you can go

340
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:23,930
through this and identify what some of

341
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,120
these things are to find out what kind

342
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:30,550
of structures they are at the moment

343
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:33,339
however these are isolated structures

344
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:35,990
could be flip-flops or something that

345
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:38,600
but not connected to each other and as

346
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:40,519
you go through the stack this is rather

347
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:44,209
darker than I expected by the way so I'm

348
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:45,110
sorry about the image quality here I

349
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:47,119
thought it would come out a little

350
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:49,519
brighter than that but there are is

351
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,230
another metal layer above there and each

352
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,180
time you come up there's another metal

353
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:55,130
layer and you can see the density of

354
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,620
metal layers you get honor and this is

355
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:59,449
not a complex circuit this is a relative

356
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:02,120
of the ordinary circuit the density of

357
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:04,339
the metal layers which are causing which

358
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,650
are the connections between the

359
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:09,198
different elements of that circuit and

360
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:12,199
how you try to sort of work out which

361
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,120
ones are connected to Hawkes from where

362
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:17,600
they go and things like that it's a hard

363
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:21,049
and difficult problem requiring some

364
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,698
very good experience some knowledge of

365
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:24,500
what's going on there and some good

366
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:26,929
software to be able to recognize what's

367
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:29,330
what these things are because at some

368
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:32,090
point and certainly at this point it

369
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:34,879
gets beyond what a normal human being

370
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:40,090
who work out in their own head that's a

371
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:42,620
map where the signals are going hard

372
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,909
go up there's more metal layers to

373
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:46,969
connect these things in different

374
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:53,630
directions and all the way up that's the

375
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:56,390
essence op Lola and in honor properly

376
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:58,880
hardened circuit you start to get to the

377
00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:01,160
next level of problem which is right at

378
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,490
the very top which are the secure

379
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:06,820
shields that are protecting all that

380
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:09,530
circuitry underneath from your attack

381
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:11,929
using something like focused ion beam

382
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:15,200
system so you have the circuitry

383
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:17,600
underneath which you have to try and

384
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,570
understand what's what it's doing how

385
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,550
it's working and even if you get to the

386
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:25,790
point if you know where things are and

387
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:28,820
how things work you still have the final

388
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:31,550
problem of getting through a top shield

389
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:33,409
which is designed to stop you from

390
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:35,960
getting at the circuit underneath and

391
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:37,760
it's something like that's no it's hard

392
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:41,960
to really see what it is but if you see

393
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:44,120
here it's some sort of Wiggly lines the

394
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:48,050
serpentine lines going all over the

395
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:50,360
circuit and if you short circuit two of

396
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:52,159
those lines together there's a good

397
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:56,149
chance the circuit will detect it and

398
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:59,840
say I'm not going to work anymore and if

399
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:02,420
you cut aligned it detects illnesses I'm

400
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:05,540
not going to work anymore so you're

401
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:10,160
stuck in this thing unless you find some

402
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:12,850
way of bypassing this secure shield so

403
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,850
how can you do that

404
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:23,899
first thing is to do first to focus it

405
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:28,429
at a relatively easy case of a small

406
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:30,410
single area of that circuit let's just

407
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:32,960
say you want to just get get a single

408
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:36,080
point in I said you know an example

409
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,650
might be if you want to probe the output

410
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:42,590
of a random number generator single line

411
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:44,780
you might need to probe in that and you

412
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:47,570
may know exactly where on the circuit

413
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:51,080
you need to go from the mapping that you

414
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:53,659
had done previously and somehow you can

415
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:56,300
relate that to some point on the circuit

416
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:57,740
for example this is difficult to see but

417
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:01,850
there is a circuit line going through

418
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:03,920
underneath here under there and it

419
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:06,290
follows through you're not actually

420
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,240
looking at the circuit line in this

421
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:10,340
actual image though because what you

422
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,640
have is a circuit line that you can see

423
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:16,760
the effect of but it's underneath a

424
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:21,860
layer of dielectric insulating it from

425
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:25,640
anything above so we'd like to try to do

426
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:27,649
something about that but we have here

427
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,950
for example a line that comes down from

428
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:32,990
the top follows round all the way around

429
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:35,420
here up here up here up here up here

430
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:38,270
it's a single line and if we connect

431
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:41,060
from there to there we can create a

432
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:42,650
bypass that will effectively eliminate

433
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:52,730
all this little bit of circuitry

434
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:54,710
underneath it very local area but it

435
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:57,740
could be useful if it's just above the

436
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:59,750
area that you wanting to do something in

437
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,620
perhaps put down that probe pad or

438
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:04,730
something like that

439
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:08,479
how can you do that how can you remove

440
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:10,340
that part of the circuit the first thing

441
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:14,420
is you can use your focused ion beam to

442
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:19,100
dig through the dielectric above the

443
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:22,190
circuit tracks and deposit a new piece

444
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:27,260
of circuit short-circuiting that loop

445
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:30,530
off the shield you've gone through made

446
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:33,710
two little holes above the circuit track

447
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:36,110
and just deposited a new track short

448
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:38,030
circuiting that out completely you're

449
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:39,500
not sure you're taking two separate

450
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:41,780
tracks you're short-circuiting the same

451
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:45,050
to actually just removing that the

452
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:48,830
effect of that loop in the middle the

453
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:52,600
next thing is you expose the hole of

454
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:56,060
that extra bit of loop that you have

455
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:58,189
using a dielectric etch such as the

456
00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:02,870
xenon difluoride gas with the iron beam

457
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:06,860
and then you can remove the metal that

458
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:11,059
you've just exposed so now you have

459
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:13,189
created a hole in that shield in an area

460
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:15,410
such as this that allows you to get down

461
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:24,860
below that and do whatever you need to

462
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:27,110
do to get to the circuit however that's

463
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:29,689
just one little area it's relatively

464
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:33,379
easy to do that but it's just one little

465
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:35,540
area you'd like to do much larger areas

466
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:37,820
of a whole shield which covers the

467
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:39,500
entire chip if you can and there's a

468
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:41,750
little bit more of a difficult and

469
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,730
complex problem to remove the entire

470
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:47,480
shield so how might you do something

471
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:50,179
like that the first thing is you would

472
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:54,620
like to be able to recognize where the

473
00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:59,630
entire circuits of that shield are in

474
00:22:54,620 --> 00:23:01,639
this case I put the circuit not into the

475
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:03,200
focused ion beam or at least not using

476
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:06,620
the focused ion beam but in this case

477
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:10,190
using the electron microscope and if you

478
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:12,739
use an electron microscope and you turn

479
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:16,010
the voltage up to its maximum thirty

480
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:21,020
kilovolts normally and you look at a

481
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:24,290
circuit then something shrine out at you

482
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:28,850
and these things which are shining out

483
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:30,889
at you are the connections to the layer

484
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:33,770
below I'm sure that some of you know

485
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:38,080
exactly what those things are any

486
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:42,590
answers those are the tungsten plugs

487
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:45,290
going down to the layout below why do

488
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:47,330
they shine out and it because you're

489
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:49,370
using a specific mode of the electron

490
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:56,470
microscope called backscattered electron

491
00:23:49,370 --> 00:24:00,290
mode which looks at electrons not

492
00:23:56,470 --> 00:24:02,000
returned to your detector from the the

493
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:04,639
bulk of the atom that you're looking at

494
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,940
the electrons which hit the nucleus of

495
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:10,790
the atom and are bounced back in what

496
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:12,700
you call a backscatter event and since

497
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:15,800
they're hitting the nucleus of the atom

498
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:18,590
the number coming back depends entirely

499
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:20,470
on the mass of the atom is hitting

500
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:22,620
something big and heavy

501
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:25,000
like a tungsten atom in this case and

502
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:26,500
therefore more of them get bounced back

503
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,600
and you can see them much more clearly

504
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,610
so in something like backscattered

505
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,919
electron mode you can start to see

506
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:35,139
specific parts of the circuit that you

507
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:37,420
wouldn't see who are using normal

508
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:39,460
secondary electron mode in an electron

509
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:42,700
microscope now we can see the ends of

510
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:45,040
those tracks and in fact in this case if

511
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:47,400
you short-circuit these two together and

512
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:52,500
short-circuit those two together you can

513
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:56,740
eliminate whole circuits in that shield

514
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:58,420
so they go in and cut where that those

515
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:00,970
are the two thumbs and plugs just under

516
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:03,070
underneath there are two plugs going in

517
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:05,740
parallel down if you cut that part of

518
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:10,750
the circuit away you can cut that

519
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:13,950
circuit out and you cut it there and you

520
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:18,730
cut it in the other place and you've now

521
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:20,950
stopped that circuit from kin contacting

522
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:24,550
anything underneath it and now look

523
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:28,530
what's happened in the circuit lines you

524
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:34,120
can see there's two different sheets of

525
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:36,270
the track in that circuit what's

526
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:38,969
happening here

527
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:44,110
this is effect and effect we call

528
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:48,280
voltage contrast so when the electrons

529
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:52,120
or ions of you using a focus time them

530
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:54,580
to do it hit a track if that track is

531
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:57,760
disconnected by cutting it from anywhere

532
00:25:54,580 --> 00:26:01,120
else it is not connected to ground and

533
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:03,670
it can float up to any potential any

534
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:08,229
voltage that the iron beam or electron

535
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:12,960
beam is is imparting to it and in this

536
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:15,430
case if it charges up positively then

537
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,170
what will happen is that the electrons

538
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:18,970
which would like to escape from there

539
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:21,550
can't escape from now they get sucked

540
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:23,560
back into that area and the whole thing

541
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:26,590
appears dark so now you can identify

542
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:29,200
exactly where your circuits are by using

543
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:31,300
techniques like this voltage contrast

544
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,490
technique and identify where the

545
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,899
contacts are by using

546
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:38,679
techniques such as backscattered

547
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:41,500
electron imaging this is all to do how

548
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:43,540
you understand how how Europe microscopy

549
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:47,050
works to find out what's going on in a

550
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:49,809
circuit when you know how these tools

551
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:52,659
work well you can use all the potential

552
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:56,740
all their ability to give you the

553
00:26:52,660 --> 00:27:00,670
information you need to get into that

554
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:03,670
circuit and happy once you've done that

555
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:05,140
you can make these short circuits which

556
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:09,850
will then short-circuit where this is

557
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:12,490
that part of that circuit track begins

558
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:15,100
where it ends short-circuit and you can

559
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:17,650
remove very large areas of that circuit

560
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:20,830
and in this particular case there were

561
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:24,880
16 separate circuits in the shield going

562
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:27,580
around you find the 16 different track

563
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,559
ends and beginnings short circuit them

564
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:37,030
and you can effectively remove the

565
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:38,970
entire shield from that circuit another

566
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:42,940
way of doing it on this is or another

567
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:47,800
type of shield where you have multiple

568
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:49,450
shield lines going up and down and in

569
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:55,840
fact that we go up to the top a cross

570
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:57,850
down cross up like that but you don't

571
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,070
know exactly where the lines are because

572
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:03,159
the way that the order of those lines

573
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:06,129
get randomised line number one here

574
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:09,820
could end up anywhere in the second

575
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:13,540
column of track coming down so you can't

576
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:15,730
just guess which circuits are the

577
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:17,950
beginning on which are the ends of those

578
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:20,290
circuits to put them together so you can

579
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:22,240
use some information again from the same

580
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:23,620
techniques such as looking at those

581
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,830
little dots there which are the

582
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:29,979
backscattered electron images that you

583
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:33,428
have here I guess you notice is slightly

584
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:35,530
fuzzier and in that case it's not it's

585
00:28:33,429 --> 00:28:37,620
just a slightly deeper circuit but we

586
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:40,750
can still see exactly where those

587
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:43,000
electron the the tungsten plugs are

588
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:44,740
going down there but we still want to

589
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,350
find out exactly where that circuit is

590
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:50,440
and how we can begin to bypass

591
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:53,320
areas of that circuit so one way of

592
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:57,970
doing being able to do that is that we

593
00:28:53,320 --> 00:29:00,939
can start opening up that circuit using

594
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:04,990
the focus time beam the first thing is

595
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:08,320
you just expose the first column of

596
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:11,410
sixteen lines which are those sixteen

597
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,700
different circuits and you expose them

598
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:14,500
so you can see the metal that's the

599
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:19,299
bright areas there are the exposed

600
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:22,150
tracks underneath that closest to where

601
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:23,770
the plugs that actually are going down

602
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:25,390
to the deeper part of the circuit this

603
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:28,210
is the center part of the circuit you

604
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:29,770
cut those tracks completely you mill

605
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:35,080
down to the tracks and you keep going

606
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:37,270
and you cut them completely if you were

607
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,370
to power up the circuit now it would

608
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:43,030
detect it all circuit lines are broken

609
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:44,830
and you know there's been a breach and

610
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:46,750
it will shut things down but you don't

611
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:50,010
power up the chip at the moment it's as

612
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:54,490
far as its concerned it's still asleep

613
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:57,760
next thing you can do you suppose those

614
00:29:54,490 --> 00:30:03,270
lines cut the tracks in she goes for the

615
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:06,129
next 16 that lines across so the circuit

616
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:07,210
comes up from the depths of the logic

617
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:09,580
down here somewhere

618
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:11,799
the tracks come up and they're cut here

619
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:14,860
but they come up again further and they

620
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:15,220
go to these randomizing sort of lines go

621
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:18,939
across

622
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:21,760
come and down the next 16 lines of the

623
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:23,740
circuit so you have sixteen lines going

624
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,720
up coming across sixteen lines going

625
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:33,039
down and going on all the way across the

626
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:36,970
entire circuit if we now to make the

627
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:41,500
second column here of ferny and cut one

628
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:46,210
of the tracks what do we see and this

629
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:49,720
point this particular track that we've

630
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:54,480
exposed here goes dark again that's

631
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:58,179
because of the voltage contrast effect

632
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,770
so we know which lines now are connected

633
00:30:58,179 --> 00:31:02,409
to the other ones in the different

634
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:04,629
columns and all we need to do now is to

635
00:31:02,409 --> 00:31:06,850
go down through at the bottom there and

636
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:10,090
make a connection between that line

637
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:12,549
there and the first line of the second

638
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:16,600
column and we've repaired that

639
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:18,700
particular part of the track and we can

640
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,918
do that again for the second one we can

641
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,809
cut the second line here we find that it

642
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:25,510
actually comes from here and make a

643
00:31:22,809 --> 00:31:29,470
second repair and do that for all of the

644
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:33,340
lines which now makes the entire circuit

645
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:35,260
above here completely redundant and we

646
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:43,928
can remove it completely to get to

647
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:45,100
everything underneath that circuit once

648
00:31:43,929 --> 00:31:49,650
you've done that you can do other things

649
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:49,649
such as putting down a probe pad

650
00:31:51,750 --> 00:32:07,750
I'm not quite sure that we don't know

651
00:31:54,309 --> 00:32:10,149
just now but you can put sorry here's

652
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:12,669
the bus explores in there as I said in

653
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:16,899
this case it's a 32-bit bus which is

654
00:32:12,669 --> 00:32:21,010
quite hard to probe things on and up

655
00:32:16,899 --> 00:32:22,899
here you've got probe pads put down and

656
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:25,330
contacting onto some of those lines of

657
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:27,250
the bus there are only eight down there

658
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:29,770
because it can only probe eight lines at

659
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:32,020
a time that's just don't have the tool

660
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:34,240
to be able to do more than eight on a

661
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:36,790
standard probe station but you can

662
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,740
effectively put more probes down and

663
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:42,850
problems separately as you need to do

664
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:44,559
that and it looks a bit like a graveyard

665
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:46,480
because of all the crosses in there and

666
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:49,120
this chip is a bit of a graveyard I

667
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,530
believe but that's the visitor more

668
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,120
excited like that crosses are good

669
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:54,070
because you can get your probe needles

670
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:56,049
right into the the corners or the

671
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:59,850
crossies without them skidding away and

672
00:32:56,049 --> 00:32:59,850
it's a good contact for these

673
00:33:02,419 --> 00:33:06,960
just to turn things on its head again

674
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:09,750
and almost literally turning things on

675
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:13,799
its head because the next topic is going

676
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:15,899
to be how you can come in to a circuit

677
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:17,610
from the back because if that shield is

678
00:33:15,899 --> 00:33:19,379
too hard to get through and some of the

679
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:21,750
shields are extremely hard to get

680
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:24,360
through you might want to consider that

681
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:31,830
you can come in through the back of a

682
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:34,110
circuit itself it's quite difficult the

683
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:36,899
first thing is you've got to get through

684
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:39,959
a very thick layer of silicon

685
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:45,449
now when I say thick meaning something

686
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:48,450
from 200 up to 4 400 maybe 100 to 400 or

687
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:50,580
500 micron stake I may not sound thick

688
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:52,289
to many people but to me that's it

689
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:54,720
incredibly thick layer to get through

690
00:33:52,289 --> 00:33:57,629
compared with the stuff on the surface

691
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,370
and you can see that you got from the

692
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:01,740
back surface of a chip here you've got

693
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:05,158
this really deep hole to get down into

694
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:07,049
the circuit below so you don't choose

695
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:09,570
this technique lights that you do it

696
00:34:07,049 --> 00:34:12,030
when you have to and in some cases you

697
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:13,820
do have to the case is you know for

698
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:16,889
example if you have a really difficult

699
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:19,830
shield on top to get through or if the

700
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:22,080
chip has multiple ball bonds you know if

701
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:25,230
you're talking about a sort of big

702
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,848
processor for a you know computer or

703
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:28,409
something out the volkl ball bonds and

704
00:34:26,849 --> 00:34:30,179
you can't really get in from the surface

705
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:31,950
because of that you will then have to

706
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:38,220
choose some technique like this to get

707
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:42,928
into it and coming into that can be

708
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:45,149
difficult your first help is that you

709
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:47,429
can see through the silicon if you have

710
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:52,409
your infrared camera you can begin to

711
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:54,780
see some of the tracks there the problem

712
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:58,830
is that you don't have much resolution

713
00:34:54,780 --> 00:35:01,470
on that you know infrared beam has maybe

714
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:03,779
a resolution of about a micron but

715
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:05,899
you're fine tracks are much much smaller

716
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:08,910
than that so you're only looking at

717
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:10,890
small your own look at the large

718
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:11,819
features of a chip to be able to find

719
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:13,529
out where you're going

720
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,750
you're not going to be able to use this

721
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:20,100
to get to the actual track you're

722
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:22,320
wanting that it can get you to the area

723
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:25,440
and they can get you close to what

724
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,930
you're wanting to find and of course to

725
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:32,660
get further points where you can do

726
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:35,669
better alignment you still need to have

727
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:37,609
your reverse engineering reverse

728
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:42,540
engineer layout for some of these things

729
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:43,950
and yeah you still need to have

730
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:47,520
something and you're not going to have

731
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:50,370
the GDS to lay out from our manufacturer

732
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:52,020
to help you for these things so the

733
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:54,450
first thing is you start digging in the

734
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:57,390
circuit you have to go down an iron beam

735
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:59,160
is relatively so it's designed for very

736
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:01,879
small work you know it's designed for

737
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:04,830
coming down in areas that are like a

738
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:06,570
micron or even sub micron level you know

739
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:08,460
sometimes a tenth of a micron or

740
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:10,620
something here you're digging out a

741
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:13,620
whole trench which could be hundreds of

742
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:15,810
microns across and going down hundreds

743
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:20,190
of microns so it can take some time and

744
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:22,380
the big difficulty is not keeping

745
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:25,080
digging then knowing when to stop

746
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:28,440
because just at the bottom of that track

747
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:30,240
just at the bottom of that hole just

748
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,120
before you hit the circuit and destroy

749
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:35,250
it you've got the spot where the wells

750
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:37,799
are these are these implantation wells

751
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:39,210
the end wells of a circuit that tell you

752
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:42,470
that you're right just about done

753
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:45,630
there's the circuit itself in this case

754
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:47,910
you can hit those wells and you'll be

755
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:49,980
okay but if you go through another

756
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:52,020
micron or two you've completely

757
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:53,850
destroyed your circuit so you're gonna

758
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:56,070
be milling on there maybe for an hour

759
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:57,390
but you've got to have your finger on

760
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:59,280
that trigger key you're going to stop it

761
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:04,529
within a couple of seconds before it

762
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:07,650
goes too fast and too far so you find

763
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:09,510
your circuit and the end wells become a

764
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:13,560
bit you have to stop dinging immediately

765
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:19,050
and then you have to find alignment

766
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:21,860
points between those active layers to be

767
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:24,300
able to see where you're going and your

768
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:25,530
problem again is always that you don't

769
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:28,050
have

770
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:29,970
the layout which gives you the active

771
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:31,890
layers you have a layout which you maybe

772
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:33,990
reverse engineer you know where the

773
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:37,430
metal layers are but you don't really

774
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:40,140
have the layout which contains the

775
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:42,089
n-well information as well so you've got

776
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:45,390
an additional difficulty over many of

777
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:48,060
the legitimate you know people who are

778
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:50,368
going into sort of rewire a circuit for

779
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:53,430
the manufacturer those not it's quite

780
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:56,130
difficult but you can go in there you

781
00:37:53,430 --> 00:38:00,029
can cut tracks again down at the bottom

782
00:37:56,130 --> 00:38:01,560
in there and do various things so here's

783
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:03,990
one where you can sort of deposits on

784
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:06,029
tracks and such things when you get in

785
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:08,640
there you can do that kind of very very

786
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:11,040
fine detailed work within that hole and

787
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,670
maybe you go to cut some tracks may be

788
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,650
good to deposit some things trying to

789
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:18,090
probe down those holes is very difficult

790
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:21,170
but there's always things you can do

791
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:26,010
from the backside that make these things

792
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:30,480
possible to get into and do those really

793
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:34,830
hard hacks and tests of security on some

794
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:37,790
of these chips right well that's it

795
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:45,370
friend thank you very much indeed

796
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:51,110
[Applause]

797
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:59,779
okay we have time for two questions in

798
00:38:51,110 --> 00:39:01,370
case the audience has any thanks for

799
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:04,610
your interesting talk so our question

800
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:09,109
about the identifying there the routing

801
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:13,220
of the wires on the active shield so is

802
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:15,560
it possible to just measure the pattern

803
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:17,569
on the wire to detect which one is

804
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:21,290
connected to to which point instead of

805
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:23,090
going through the fib it's kind of

806
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:26,500
possible to do some of these things so

807
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:29,810
if you have an image of the entire layer

808
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:32,150
you can see where these things are but

809
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:33,799
these are very very long tracks you

810
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:37,250
imagine that you've got a circuit line

811
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:38,900
which is maybe I thinking in some of

812
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,790
these case maybe a quarter of a micron

813
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:43,820
wide that they're big compared with some

814
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:46,610
of the features underneath but there's

815
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:49,250
still a quarter of a micron wide and the

816
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:50,890
circuit itself may be several

817
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:54,920
millimeters in size so you've got

818
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:59,120
thousands of you've got an awful lot of

819
00:39:54,920 --> 00:40:01,700
tract to sort of follow and I've never

820
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:04,790
been very successful and following it by

821
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:06,950
eye so you could follow it by some sort

822
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:09,140
of software technique to do that you try

823
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:11,810
to do it I've always just found it so

824
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:14,180
much easier to use techniques such as

825
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:17,240
voltage contrast to highlight one

826
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:19,910
circuit compared with another and to do

827
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:22,370
like that it's sort of certain way of

828
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:25,310
doing it but but following it by line

829
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:28,640
you know is a possibility it's just

830
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:32,240
tedious and prone to mistakes because

831
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:35,629
it's so they're so long compared with

832
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:39,279
you know you know all the the sort of

833
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:39,280
meandering that you have to follow

834
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:50,530
are there any shields that monitor the

835
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:52,340
resistance of the track instead of just

836
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:54,740
monitoring if it's connected or not

837
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,980
connected this has been a topic that has

838
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:57,290
been

839
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:59,119
thought about for a long time and a lot

840
00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:02,050
of security people would love to be able

841
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:05,530
to do that and it could potentially work

842
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:08,270
what you're fighting against here is

843
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:11,510
digital designers feet anything to do

844
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:14,240
with analog circuits they really really

845
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:17,720
hate it and so they will say no it can't

846
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:19,129
be done what they really mean is it can

847
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:21,140
be done if you get a good analog

848
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:22,790
engineer and a lot of these people do

849
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:24,470
companies don't have good analog

850
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:28,640
engineers and they don't want to do it

851
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:30,890
too prone to you know the sort of errors

852
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,509
what happens if the you know when the

853
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:34,368
resistance changes because you've gone

854
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:36,680
to a different temperature or in an

855
00:41:34,369 --> 00:41:41,119
either no magnetic field or something

856
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:42,919
like that you can get it makes the

857
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:46,010
circuit far more difficult to design and

858
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:48,050
it's very prone to error so designers

859
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:59,359
will say no we can't do it and they

860
00:41:48,050 --> 00:42:01,090
really mean I don't want to do it so

861
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:11,150
have you ever seen shields around

862
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:15,080
package in package constructions so if

863
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:15,710
you mean inside the actual chip package

864
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:18,500
itself

865
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:21,470
there have been attempt to do that there

866
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:23,510
was some stuff you see Cheryl I think it

867
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:27,529
was called meant to be make it difficult

868
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:29,930
to get into the package itself generally

869
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:31,520
have always been got around I mean

870
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:33,850
people from find ways of getting around

871
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:38,050
these things by by different techniques

872
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:40,490
and so they've never been really very

873
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:42,390
they're never really been used simply

874
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:45,959
because

875
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:47,620
the cost has been more than the

876
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,450
manufacturers have been willing to

877
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:50,770
accept for the level of the extra

878
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:54,790
security you get for it

879
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:57,370
so I'm not sure about that there are

880
00:42:54,790 --> 00:43:00,070
other packages that go around systems so

881
00:42:57,370 --> 00:43:03,730
for example in if you have a payment

882
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:06,130
terminal I mean they have shields they

883
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:10,240
go around the system which again are

884
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:12,550
protect these things but the people are

885
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,200
accept the cost of that because that's

886
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:16,840
part of the cost of doing business in

887
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:18,520
that field so but within a chip it's not

888
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:20,170
very common and we started with in a

889
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:22,630
chip package it's not very common and

890
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:30,760
I'm I don't think I'm I don't know how

891
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:32,540
anybody actually does it okay yeah well

892
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:36,760
thank you again thank you

893
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:36,759
[Applause]
