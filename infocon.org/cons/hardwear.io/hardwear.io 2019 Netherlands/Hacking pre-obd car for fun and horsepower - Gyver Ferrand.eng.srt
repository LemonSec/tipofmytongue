1
00:00:02,449 --> 00:00:12,900
so hello everyone I'm really happy to be

2
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:16,260
here today because some members of the

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:19,769
review board my ear oh and I will try to

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:22,939
not disappoint them and also not to

5
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:27,630
disappoint you as well

6
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:30,119
this is a story of the Honda Civic my

7
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:35,360
target is this one the white one

8
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:39,290
it's the surgeon on the Civic so it's

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,890
1985 on the Civic it's also known as the

10
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:45,120
Wanda Civic

11
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:48,600
because it's quite rare and it's 100

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,449
horsepower for 700 kilograms so it's

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:57,420
quite efficient the power-to-weight

14
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:59,610
ratio is very good what I wanted from

15
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,520
this car it is to get some more

16
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:05,729
horsepower but there is not so much

17
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:09,810
solution because there are no problem

18
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:16,079
Asian things there is not as much of

19
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:20,939
documentation - and the solution came to

20
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:24,029
be eh five-run so he sent her one and

21
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:27,048
using say on that pgm-fi so I will go

22
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:30,060
through very fast through this two parts

23
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:34,710
eh5 built and Z on the pgm-fi

24
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:36,929
presentation because after this I will

25
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,839
come to the true acting things which

26
00:01:36,929 --> 00:01:47,340
mean I try to plug my keyboard to my car

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:51,030
and some odd things happens I will not

28
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:55,799
talk about canvas because there is no

29
00:01:51,030 --> 00:02:01,049
really canvas on this car there also no

30
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:04,170
OPD so nobody port its came later to be

31
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:07,350
a bit easy ro but for this version is

32
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:11,939
kind of OBD ish sinks but the standard

33
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:13,350
is not actually existing and I will also

34
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:15,930
not talking about more condo

35
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:22,700
shanell cocking things because because

36
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:27,210
here the program is quite imaging so why

37
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:30,450
did want to run on e85 there are some

38
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:34,070
disadvantage of running eh5 it's quite

39
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:37,829
more corrosive than an edit here it's

40
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:44,310
also less lubricant so it's armed your

41
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:47,430
engine but the energetic efficiency is

42
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:51,150
quite higher so you can run faster by

43
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:55,920
building a car running on e h5 today's

44
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:58,920
the the ECU running h5 is just an

45
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,369
intermediate you see you which get

46
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:09,540
information from various Central's and

47
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:13,680
then regulate the fuel injectors on that

48
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:17,850
come with one solution in the early days

49
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,530
I think they were the first to get this

50
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:23,040
kind of electronic in cars

51
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm not sure but traditions are the

52
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:31,489
first this came from Formula One at an

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:35,660
Arras still winning in Formula One and

54
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:39,750
it's basically managing injection

55
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:42,630
through electronics this wiring here I

56
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:44,730
think is not right because there are no

57
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:48,000
line coming from the injector to the

58
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:50,850
issue so I think this one is wrong

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,510
the pgm-fi system is still used used

60
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:58,739
today in quite all on the cars

61
00:03:53,510 --> 00:04:01,019
motorcycles and also lawnmower don't

62
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:03,750
know if you have seen this one but they

63
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:07,900
are running a VTEC engine on a lawnmower

64
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:11,689
so this is a fastest term also what

65
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:16,850
beyond that html5 is managing shoot

66
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:21,349
injection by controlling the time the

67
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:25,130
injectors still open so it should be

68
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:26,690
something easy to run e85 on on that car

69
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:31,969
because if the system is already

70
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:34,570
existing you know and running e85 has a

71
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:38,930
quite of advantage it's cheaper fuel

72
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:41,630
especially in France its environment are

73
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:45,560
also friendly because it's emit less

74
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:54,440
fine particles and yes you can get

75
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:56,960
horsepower white free obd do you know

76
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,380
what's OBD mean it's just on board on a

77
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:03,590
stick so it's some kind of systems that

78
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:09,020
bring you information on the running

79
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:12,919
state the health of engine and it came

80
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:16,849
as a standard but at these days where

81
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:20,030
most on that and it's kind of forbidding

82
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:22,520
you you get some some jack gnostics

83
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:27,260
things I don't know if we see it with

84
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:31,639
some lads who threw through you messages

85
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:36,229
on error during the engine run and there

86
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:40,550
is also looking capabilities from two

87
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:43,210
who familiar with the obd2 port you got

88
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:48,139
this kind of device which called GLM's

89
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:50,870
327 and not like to talk to get the RPM

90
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:54,470
your lap time and so on so it's

91
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:57,229
basically some data loading and this is

92
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:59,780
the part I want to get on my car because

93
00:05:57,229 --> 00:06:02,120
I'm running on track day two and I

94
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:05,330
wanted to know if my engine is still

95
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:10,639
running well on it and there is some pot

96
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:14,419
I we concede here yeah it's I'm sorry

97
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:18,500
it's sense report it's a debug port it's

98
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:21,359
basically a serial port mostly you arts

99
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:25,879
and you can get data logging

100
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:30,599
on the spot it's exist on modem and join

101
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:34,259
modern on the you see you but it's not

102
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:38,938
documented on this one this is the p7

103
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:42,449
you see which is a 1985 issue and to my

104
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:46,680
knowledge no one has looked inside this

105
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:49,469
use you even in data logging or in map

106
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:53,360
changing because your engine is running

107
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:58,460
maps and this is on these maps we will

108
00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:02,759
interface to change the fuel injection

109
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:06,060
so I try to get my keyboard this one

110
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:08,729
very interesting one talking to my car

111
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,919
why I choose this one it's because it

112
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:16,110
has this screen this fancy screen here

113
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:22,080
and you know this screen should be

114
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:23,909
running some kind of arm target I just

115
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,128
look on the internet and there are also

116
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:29,219
you a pot so serial port

117
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:31,440
maybe I can just plug in directly to my

118
00:07:29,219 --> 00:07:34,919
science report and get some data logging

119
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:39,139
watching fancy interface and then

120
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:39,139
getting my data log on my keyboard

121
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:47,940
I'll say I've got also some kind of SQL

122
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:49,758
injection on their website if you have

123
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:53,430
download any of the Mad Catz

124
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:56,520
firmware lately they may have been

125
00:07:53,430 --> 00:08:00,569
bagged all because of this reliability

126
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:02,448
is there aware of it they told me that

127
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:08,490
it will be patched with the new version

128
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:13,199
in October so it should be fine I will

129
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:17,039
go very fast and the as if my analysis

130
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:21,800
things because you know we know this

131
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:25,469
kind of target its anemic target here

132
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:29,159
there is some software available online

133
00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:31,349
there is the firmware that available

134
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:33,218
online so I grabbed this frame over

135
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:37,000
there

136
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:39,219
a small beam work on it and yeah you got

137
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,969
the entire file system you can analyze

138
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:45,940
it modifies things repack it and push it

139
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:50,200
back again the flash procedure to get cg

140
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:52,990
humid is also documented so there is no

141
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,960
big challenge here it's quite common you

142
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:59,560
know you can get all the information but

143
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:03,250
what I need here is just to disable all

144
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:08,279
the Matt Cutts software because I don't

145
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:11,140
need it I just only need the the USB

146
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:15,220
management or the console port

147
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:17,890
management service to do where I will

148
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:20,440
put my slides online later but the first

149
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:23,770
one is a short version the second one is

150
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:28,779
the longer version with reverse analysis

151
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:32,740
of Shuchi app teaching some information

152
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:39,370
and you'd have rules and so I will just

153
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:42,510
show you the short version this this

154
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:47,740
target here is running a cute app and

155
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:51,240
when it starts it's it's globally just

156
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:56,830
add some mapping using the keyboard map

157
00:09:51,240 --> 00:10:00,640
some bulk USB and then it starts queued

158
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:03,850
up and yeah which should work so what I

159
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,390
need to do is just to disable all the

160
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:08,110
Matt Cutts

161
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:11,199
software's and I should get some kind of

162
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:15,400
console to interact with this is the

163
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:18,580
init script and we can see on this init

164
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:21,760
script that the last task the script is

165
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:25,480
doing is the starting of the cute

166
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:32,140
application so let's try to just come on

167
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:35,520
this part and start it again I did not

168
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:39,370
do this because I discovered some

169
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:43,000
strange things by looking on this

170
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:45,460
special target the USB port on the

171
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,950
keyboards routes like mini USB

172
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:54,460
and yeah it's not really meaning USB

173
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:57,610
series USB cable I open on the right and

174
00:10:54,460 --> 00:11:03,130
I never seen some USB cable like this

175
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:06,880
one though is a lot of wires so it's

176
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:10,959
quite strange you know this keyboard who

177
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:14,490
you to have make macro button and I

178
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:19,630
think some of these lines several lines

179
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:22,660
which are mapped to to the screen the

180
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:24,100
USB ports the difference is on oh I'm

181
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:26,949
sorry

182
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:30,930
on the right you have this part here

183
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:36,399
down there which not exist in any other

184
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:41,680
mini USB cable so I just put this apart

185
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:45,399
from now because yeah you know this is

186
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:48,279
not so so difficult so they may not be

187
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:51,610
so much challenge here just yeah you

188
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:56,050
know cuts the USB cable figure out which

189
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:59,950
lines or data lines VCC ground and yeah

190
00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:03,040
it should work that the process I don't

191
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:05,980
know at this time is a process called

192
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:09,219
you see you chipping so you see of

193
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:12,820
chipping is quite common on all on the

194
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:16,860
cars even today there are you see a

195
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:22,440
chipping the you see you mostly use is

196
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:26,200
p28 but I don't want to get to the p28

197
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:29,829
because to my knowledge nobody has

198
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:33,880
worked on this one from now and as it's

199
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:37,449
not obd there is no not so much

200
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:41,410
documentation on this so the you see

201
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:44,620
chipping is the process of removing an

202
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:48,699
external one mostly external rom you can

203
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:51,100
also get internal but on p28 and more

204
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:56,740
modern you see use there are external

205
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:58,110
external one just and solder it and get

206
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:03,360
one you can

207
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:08,790
program and put it back this special one

208
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:11,970
is not programmable so I need to yes and

209
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:14,969
solder it get a circuit find out another

210
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:18,690
chip we will look at it later but it's

211
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:24,709
quite difficult because these chips are

212
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:24,709
not a variable and yeah

213
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:32,550
there are no information at all on this

214
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:36,029
device there is a forum which is a PG

215
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:38,609
energy by grassroot and these guys have

216
00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:41,939
done amazing work on all on the cars

217
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:47,760
they have a dump of almost all on the

218
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:51,450
car since 1980 and they work they're all

219
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:55,709
tested and they work so I find someone

220
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:58,190
who has done the dump process this is

221
00:13:55,709 --> 00:14:01,920
not the most difficult process here but

222
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:08,760
this room is a mask from sink mask from

223
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:11,969
as as it for ROM you have just this is a

224
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:15,660
processing of etching which gives this

225
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:18,870
name of mask ROM so it's a ROM it's

226
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:22,860
read-only you can't program it it's all

227
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:26,100
wrong so you don't have much of

228
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:29,550
information on this one I asked someone

229
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:32,399
who is special specialized on this

230
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:35,579
process of usage people which called ice

231
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:38,820
fluid and if told me I don't know anyone

232
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:42,089
who has worked on this so you have to

233
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:48,269
figure out by yourself how to use this

234
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:52,399
from and out to swept the room I had

235
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:57,600
found out too and they did not come back

236
00:14:52,399 --> 00:15:01,079
so I decided to do it by myself and to

237
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:04,339
validate the data of the white one I ask

238
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:09,510
your local channel to read the maps

239
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:11,510
extracting and the first map ident which

240
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:15,620
I send it ice

241
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:19,480
Centrum it just not read because you

242
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:25,010
know I think I burned the rum

243
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:31,490
please airflow and yeah not it's quite

244
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:34,850
messy so I used as a reference the rum I

245
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:38,180
extract it from pgm-fi this is the

246
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:40,100
process of damping there are some Javitz

247
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:44,000
on the prawns

248
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:47,360
this process will come to this after I

249
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:53,530
use the mini Pro I don't know if you

250
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:57,410
know this one it's a gel 866 programmer

251
00:15:53,530 --> 00:16:00,980
and I choose especially this one because

252
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:05,209
it's run on Linux so you have a lot of

253
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:06,700
target on on this one quite almost all

254
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:11,360
targets

255
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:14,120
you-you-you-you we'd encounter and the

256
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,520
processes of dumping is not really

257
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:19,850
interesting you know I just burned my

258
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:23,569
ram so okay you have messed up you need

259
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:28,120
to get something to refer to and I

260
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:32,240
choose to trust the guise of pgm-fi and

261
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:35,240
when looking at my dump I'm sorry this

262
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,880
is out of the screen but when looking at

263
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:40,940
my dance the ad of the damp I have done

264
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:44,360
and the head of the dam I found from the

265
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:51,620
internet are the same so I guess it

266
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:56,890
should work and yeah it was an epic fail

267
00:16:51,620 --> 00:17:00,230
because on this special one there are

268
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:03,260
kind of no data sheet at all this is the

269
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:06,020
only one I found out and it's quite

270
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:09,619
different from the one I'm using

271
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:13,339
actually so I need to get some more

272
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:15,319
information on this from I messed up one

273
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:18,740
time I don't want to mess up a second

274
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:21,589
time so I try to get more information

275
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:24,109
and by looking at this information I

276
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:28,339
just found this post

277
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:32,770
which says there are some batch of your

278
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:37,669
rom which arm is stomped so it should be

279
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:39,770
128 kilobits memory and yeah okie the

280
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:43,910
girls manufacturer has just missed on

281
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:48,139
some of them and they are 206 and 56

282
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:53,960
kilobits memory so yeah I was kind of

283
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:57,020
lost here and I don't really know what

284
00:17:53,960 --> 00:18:02,380
to think because the memory I got from

285
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:06,740
internet is also 256 kilobits memory

286
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:13,630
this first says yeah you know you may

287
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:19,960
have a rom of 200 and 250 six cubits but

288
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:24,890
mine who the damp I have done he is only

289
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:31,450
128 kilobits so I need to do some more

290
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:31,450
oesn't and to get through this problem I

291
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:40,280
finally find out on the same forum

292
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:44,120
someone who has a very special map it's

293
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:47,389
a map from on the race team of Honda

294
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:51,500
it's a map from the group and so it's a

295
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:57,410
race car and it's from my su-37

296
00:18:51,500 --> 00:19:03,980
so it's good and they say it's split

297
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:07,250
into memory of 64 kilobits so come back

298
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:10,180
to my first guess which is 128 kilobits

299
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,180
okay

300
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:17,420
but when I look at the schematics yeah

301
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:21,020
it's quite different from the one I have

302
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:26,300
and they have splits the memory into pot

303
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:28,600
and use an address decoder so for those

304
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:32,960
who don't know who address decoders are

305
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:35,270
it's just mechanism to get speak to

306
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,810
multiple memories and

307
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:42,650
to address to map this memories to the

308
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:46,040
internal state of the spirit so okay I

309
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:52,070
just have to contain it concatenates

310
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:54,680
them I guess so I use DD and I take the

311
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:55,780
first one the second one and drew them

312
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,970
together

313
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:02,510
panties did not work I can't open them

314
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:05,750
in my software which is on data but I

315
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:11,240
sent them to my juniors who and he can't

316
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:13,580
open it so I may have done some mistake

317
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,160
somewhere and when you are using act

318
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:18,230
address decoder you have to add this one

319
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,690
to the last address of the first memory

320
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:26,960
and I just missed this press one

321
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:29,300
so I make another dump and I know I just

322
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,930
add this first one and I sent his them

323
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:34,550
to my tuner he can open it and I can

324
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:36,320
open it in on that at all so

325
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:40,490
everything's good

326
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:43,550
why I did use this special map it's

327
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:46,190
because when I look further to the

328
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:49,490
process of data logging on on that you

329
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:52,820
see use you need to add a snipe at of

330
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:56,000
cod to your map to get the data logging

331
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:58,490
work without this code you can plug on

332
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:03,710
your your serial ports you will have no

333
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:05,990
data and on this map there is data log

334
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:08,750
in by default so I will try to

335
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:14,290
reconstruct this one so I don't have to

336
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:16,880
reverse the code because it's 80 85

337
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:19,070
architecture and I really don't know

338
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:25,550
this architecture and I can't get the

339
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:28,639
common tension and this one so when I

340
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:31,790
glue things together I succeeded in to

341
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,980
getting some maps this is a map you may

342
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:38,030
have seen some some of them somewhere

343
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:38,540
before it's it's a map who weren't you

344
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:41,590
wondering

345
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:46,159
it's basically ratio air and fuel ratio

346
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:47,090
among the APM so this is it I can read

347
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:53,990
it

348
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:57,908
it should work and when I plug this to

349
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:57,909
my car some odd things happens

350
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:04,299
everything was fine when when I I turned

351
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:09,320
the key on I got my dashboard light on

352
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:16,610
there is no messages on my ECU or late

353
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:19,460
or let off and I plugged my FTDI so I

354
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:21,590
got some data garbage that habit I I've

355
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,159
got some that I saw it it should have

356
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:28,399
worked

357
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:31,610
and really not because I don't hear the

358
00:22:28,399 --> 00:22:36,080
fuel pump when I turn the key on

359
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:38,658
but it may be normal because it's quite

360
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:42,049
common on race car to get fuel circuits

361
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:46,490
on a separate circuit in case of

362
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:49,908
accidents and so on there is also check

363
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:53,389
some validation but I don't really think

364
00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:55,340
here I messed up with the checksum so I

365
00:22:53,389 --> 00:23:00,769
have no idea what's happened so I

366
00:22:55,340 --> 00:23:06,908
decided to do another dump and yeah you

367
00:23:00,769 --> 00:23:10,340
know when I make my my Bang Theory I

368
00:23:06,909 --> 00:23:13,759
just flash the second part of the memory

369
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:18,199
so it's the first part where the cut

370
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:20,869
should be was just empty and that's why

371
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:24,470
it did not work you can see the

372
00:23:20,869 --> 00:23:27,379
dashboard is light up I did not have any

373
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:29,629
messages here it's just my FTDI which is

374
00:23:27,379 --> 00:23:35,629
a blue in here but I don't have any

375
00:23:29,629 --> 00:23:39,168
messages and you need here to fire so I

376
00:23:35,629 --> 00:23:43,789
need you to erase my room to get the

377
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:47,299
right binary on it and it's UV visible

378
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:50,929
ROM it's quite difficult today to get

379
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:54,559
some UV rays err I did not have time to

380
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:56,840
get one on internet online so I decided

381
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,950
to ask some friend electronics and

382
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:03,449
friends old one too

383
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:07,649
I've done quite then I can I pass ink

384
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:10,649
and they did not have this I was also in

385
00:24:07,649 --> 00:24:16,199
beauty Institute and I think I fear the

386
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:18,029
lady and the then come a solution now

387
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:23,369
the season

388
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:28,139
none of them are blue in UV but there is

389
00:24:23,369 --> 00:24:30,720
a cat toy and this is this one and the

390
00:24:28,139 --> 00:24:35,969
kind of leather and I can play with it

391
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:43,320
and it also has UV and when I'm looking

392
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:46,859
at this pack of this time the it's the

393
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:49,879
right UV to erase the room so I think it

394
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:49,879
should do the job

395
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:59,549
this is the current state of the project

396
00:24:53,299 --> 00:25:02,129
with a UV eraser here it has been in

397
00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:06,570
this configuration for two weeks and I

398
00:25:02,129 --> 00:25:09,600
just remove almost 20% of the memory so

399
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:12,600
if someone has a new via razor I'm

400
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:17,939
really happy to speak with you and it

401
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:22,980
will finally finish this project because

402
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:26,009
yeah you know just some error so what I

403
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:28,909
need to do next is just flash the

404
00:25:26,009 --> 00:25:37,109
correct from this one food work because

405
00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:40,080
all things aligned well digest my local

406
00:25:37,109 --> 00:25:44,220
channel can open it and yeah he already

407
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:49,049
has modified to run a e85 so I just need

408
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:54,210
to get his dump flash it to my a prom

409
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:56,809
and close this project so did you have

410
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:56,809
any question

411
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:07,520
so you can also get 85 conversion kits

412
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:11,060
that have a small computer in them that

413
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:14,870
will just read the original gasoline

414
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:20,600
pulses for the injectors calculate the

415
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:22,729
new one and use that to actually put the

416
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:25,129
correct injection time for an 85 why

417
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:27,830
didn't you just use that because there

418
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:30,140
are no sensors and when you run you you

419
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:32,629
when you run with Kristin

420
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:37,460
you see external issue you need to have

421
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:39,110
some sensors and also some new injectors

422
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:42,190
to get it working

423
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:44,540
this is stuck and it's running stuck

424
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:47,300
this is why I don't want to get an

425
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:50,570
external device and the next general

426
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:52,550
device can't work yeah this is effectual

427
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:54,980
one can't work here in this

428
00:26:52,550 --> 00:27:12,350
configuration if you need to add some

429
00:26:54,980 --> 00:27:18,130
other peripheral to get it funny any

430
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:18,129
more questions that's it thanks
