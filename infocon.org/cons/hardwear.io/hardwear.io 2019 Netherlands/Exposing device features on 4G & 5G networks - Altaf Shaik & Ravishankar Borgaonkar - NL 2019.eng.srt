1
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:07,740
thank you very much so I think I just

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,590
heal really briefly you mentioned the

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,780
bio and we not really focusing on or we

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,969
don't have a two or three slides ten

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,400
minutes explaining who we are we just

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,960
skip that part but I think people are

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,330
smart enough to just Google and see so

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,249
basically we work in long time on mobile

9
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,288
communication last ten years and we were

10
00:00:23,249 --> 00:00:27,418
part of security and telecommunication

11
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:29,339
that's the department in Berlin where I

12
00:00:27,419 --> 00:00:31,859
also got my PhD the same place he is

13
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:33,720
doing so it's been quite heavily focused

14
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,790
on telecom research for example

15
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,980
and since within this since last ten

16
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:42,510
years so how many people in the room has

17
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,830
know Phi G or briefly or something so

18
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,570
there are couple of people who raise

19
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,970
their hands so I will skip all those

20
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,250
marketing slides about Phi G this gives

21
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:51,600
low latency and all something but I will

22
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,240
just come to the straight to the point

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,460
to the cream what exactly Phi is you be

24
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,440
talking about and what is the first

25
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,170
people talking about Phi G security

26
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,910
concerns and problem and what this is

27
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,719
about and just to give some small

28
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:09,090
context on first half and then we focus

29
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:11,339
on the radio protocols what we've been

30
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,920
working on on on Phi Z radio side I know

31
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,749
how this can be exposed for a IOT

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,039
devices as well as mobile devices and

33
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:18,780
there are some attacks and something

34
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:21,149
we've covered but the fighter

35
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,069
deployments so in Europe or in u.s. what

36
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:24,780
the current fight you is going on so

37
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:27,960
there are basically two types of phi g

38
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,850
that everybody are talking about so we

39
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,999
will have a number of devices now this

40
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:35,490
is the face of a area where we're not

41
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:37,949
talking about connecting mobile device

42
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,259
but allowing two devices to talk to each

43
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,210
other so this is the next few years

44
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,369
we'll be doing this research and that's

45
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,139
what we will have a more massive two

46
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:49,889
massive device-to-device communication

47
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:51,630
as well and since this year we have a 5g

48
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:54,060
it means we'll have a new 5g towers

49
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,729
everywhere being deployed and that's

50
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,740
like new brand FISA towers that will be

51
00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:00,689
more than 4G what you have in the area

52
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,869
and those will be connected to the

53
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:06,329
existing 4G core network like whatever

54
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:08,848
the kpn operator for example or or

55
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:10,679
arrange or any operator and that's like

56
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:14,310
one type of deployment and that is

57
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,610
called non standalone mode 5g network so

58
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,800
nine

59
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,680
percent of deployment all over the world

60
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,180
basically are like this so this is a

61
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,210
low-cost where you just use the existing

62
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,830
4G network and this you just attach 5g

63
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,410
base stations and off you go then you

64
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,450
have a this higher speed and all this

65
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,150
thing you can get with this Phi G so

66
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:35,549
this is what we have this one but in

67
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:39,150
order to have ultra-low latency as well

68
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:41,459
as the lower high G VPS capacity and

69
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,290
also clarification of a core network

70
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:45,510
then we will have a hopefully by next

71
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,459
year I think in Asia are some mobile

72
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,500
operators are already doing this so

73
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:52,170
don't quote me on this part but

74
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,610
basically it depending on what mobile

75
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,170
operators are taking a strategy so we

76
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,120
will have a 5g towers and then we will

77
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,850
attach with this Phi G core network

78
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,100
which is completely evolved core network

79
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:04,260
and this is basically called standalone

80
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,820
mode so many times you will read the

81
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:09,090
report on Phi G and people are talking

82
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:11,609
about Phi G and I say it's not NSA from

83
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,890
us but it's a non standalone mode Phi G

84
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,900
and this is the Phi G si called stand

85
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:18,779
alone mode so these are the two types of

86
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,400
deployments and and to to had a

87
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,830
different kind of security architecture

88
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,660
as well the way your data is being

89
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,010
encrypted or handled within the core

90
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,769
network so they it has a different

91
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:31,440
implication of security as well also

92
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:33,000
when it compares to IOT device as well

93
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:37,170
or low-power battery device in that

94
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,820
sense and Wi-Fi G is mostly really

95
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:40,708
important and we really people are not

96
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,660
talking about Phi G so what will happen

97
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:44,610
in next 20 years imagine what could be

98
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:49,799
the changing scenario is what we're

99
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:53,040
talking about right so so basically how

100
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:56,430
many people have a 1gbps home broadband

101
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,160
connection in their house 1 Gbps so I

102
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,959
see 2 or 3 hands if you're from Finland

103
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,030
I can say everybody has it but not in a

104
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,160
European country you have it so

105
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,590
basically imagine that if you are

106
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,510
getting any wireless device and having 1

107
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:12,090
Gbps connection no matter where you goes

108
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:14,030
will people start digging the ground

109
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:16,798
cables again putting the modems or

110
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:18,298
something like this so yeah so this is

111
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,769
what Phi is you gonna bring sits like

112
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:22,469
you will have a fight you towers and

113
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:24,539
every wireless device or even every

114
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:27,150
mobile device which you carrying when I

115
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:28,260
have at least 1 Gbps speed so this is

116
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:30,989
what exactly

117
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:33,330
we will have it with Fiji and people

118
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:37,140
expecting that maybe this will replace

119
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:40,109
the existing wired cable connections

120
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,580
which no longer required for example so

121
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,710
this means that your every home

122
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,270
appliance will start talking with base

123
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,320
stations we don't know maybe you will

124
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,359
have a gateway or something like this

125
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,860
but that's will be believe me becoming a

126
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,180
national critical infrastructure where

127
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,690
every devices will be connected to

128
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,640
wirelessly and basically traffic is or

129
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:58,890
or let's put this way we will have a

130
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,020
more traffic which is being handled by a

131
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:03,659
wireless networks rather than a wired

132
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:06,530
network or for example and this was has

133
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,220
a drastic change in terms of national

134
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,929
critical communication as well

135
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,780
infrastructure so this is important in

136
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:16,230
the in that a reason so let's look at

137
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,789
the what kind of different model when we

138
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:20,310
now explain slide I will just try to

139
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:22,320
give some small architecture which I use

140
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:24,540
as a base recently generic architecture

141
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,920
so we'll have a mobile phone and base

142
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,600
stations everybody knows like

143
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,950
everybody's carrying a mobile phone and

144
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,690
then it talks to the base station and

145
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,760
that's that's basically we call radio

146
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:35,340
access network okay that's a left left

147
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,050
part and then it is being connected with

148
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:40,049
the core network so it's in a green

149
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:42,120
right now why because until 4G green

150
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:43,980
means that it's pretty hard for an

151
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,990
attacker to get direct access to this

152
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:48,210
core network of course you can get

153
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,770
access as long as you compromise mobile

154
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:51,390
phone and then you are attacking a base

155
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,669
station or something like this so it's

156
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:56,640
still pretend to be a closed wall walled

157
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:58,410
garden that is pretty much secured as

158
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,409
long as until you make a physical

159
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:02,820
barrier and an and and not compromise

160
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:04,410
the building for example so it's like

161
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:08,370
this there are some other ways as well

162
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:09,690
to act gate access which has been here

163
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,940
but I'm not really focused on on that

164
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:13,560
one but still on an average is quite

165
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,360
secure and this is what looks like a PI

166
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,950
G architecture so I'm not going to

167
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,990
explain each and every block to get

168
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:21,240
bored you telling technical what it is

169
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:24,600
there but this is what changed somehow

170
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:27,570
now and what is the main point I need to

171
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,190
highlight you what has been changed what

172
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:30,540
you see on the left side basically you

173
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,400
have this mobile phone which is called

174
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:36,990
UE which is a user equipment which is

175
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:38,849
with using and and now onwards we may

176
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,860
have a more embedded SIM cards other

177
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,550
than removable SIM cards so this is what

178
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,949
new train

179
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:45,389
which we're gonna see now so you can't

180
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:47,190
have a you can't remove you a SIM card

181
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:48,539
for example or your SIM card will be

182
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:50,940
manufacture when the phone is being

183
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:52,830
manufactured so it's like an embedded on

184
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:55,259
the device and then we will have a

185
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:57,210
number of base stations what we say it

186
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:59,580
in technical terms is called G node B

187
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:02,008
and as I told you in Phi G we will have

188
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,840
a more base station than 4G it means

189
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:06,509
that your base stations may be deployed

190
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,520
on the bus stop or a street lamp so it

191
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:11,159
will be many areas where it may not be

192
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,840
secured enough physical security will

193
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:14,759
not be good enough so we have a new

194
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,190
architecture called centralized unit and

195
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:19,500
decentralized unit for example so we

196
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:21,120
will have a separation of base stations

197
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,520
and the traffic just for a protection

198
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,159
that angle and and the main interesting

199
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,500
thing has been changed is basically what

200
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:31,560
you see in this red block this goes in a

201
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,449
cloud completely so so you can implement

202
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,069
all this element in a cloud and you know

203
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:37,520
law you know you no longer need to have

204
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:39,830
a special IP equipments for each block

205
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,120
so you can have the existing in

206
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:44,669
infrastructure let's say any any cloud

207
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,259
instance which you run on nowadays on on

208
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:49,560
a cloud so any bare metal for example

209
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:52,169
and you can just have every block as a

210
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,669
slice for example or what this is it

211
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:55,590
could be a slice based infrastructure it

212
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:57,210
could be just completely Co network

213
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:58,888
running in the cloud you can have a H

214
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,900
cloud you can have the centralized cloud

215
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:03,900
and all these nodes goes into the cloud

216
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,969
now where it's a cost-effective battery

217
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:08,310
saving many new features whether at the

218
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:12,750
same time it introduced a new area of a

219
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:14,099
security and it's it's a it's a bad I

220
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:17,009
mean I can't really say conclusively

221
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:19,020
that as an attacker you will still get

222
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:21,569
access to this cloud or not I mean it

223
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,849
depends on the deployment because this

224
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:25,319
is only one block of a core network but

225
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:27,599
this network has to have a different

226
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:29,729
api's for different operators different

227
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,229
services to talk to each other and then

228
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:32,968
this API is means they have to give

229
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:36,569
access to this core network as well so

230
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:38,360
that you modify many things as along so

231
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:41,729
this this opens up a new area for

232
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:44,399
research and what has been evolved in 5g

233
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:45,839
when we look at this architecture as I

234
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,600
said the 5g core network has been

235
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:52,230
heavily evolved and this has been dusted

236
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,820
change in Phi G and and and the

237
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,360
technologies we've been using in fight

238
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,220
you know so basically you have a cloud

239
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,769
completing programmable Network mobile

240
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,720
is computing you read many documents now

241
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:03,399
people talk about all these technologies

242
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,980
what are their advantages what is the

243
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:07,720
dynamic aspects we bring into the cloud

244
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,640
infrastructure for example here network

245
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,320
function virtualization and if you look

246
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:14,410
at the security actually each block has

247
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,029
own security implications each each

248
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:18,399
block has its own security challenges

249
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:20,110
and now all this has to be combined into

250
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,149
the single core network block so it

251
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:23,769
means that operators are actually has to

252
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:25,779
care about more security of this

253
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:28,990
different angle which is quite new for

254
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:30,790
them to operate or handle like there are

255
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:32,200
many companies who handles one block and

256
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:33,370
they have their own security team which

257
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,260
handling many things for example

258
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:37,870
deployment and and basically the

259
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:39,579
assistance on software and software

260
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,649
Security's a different aspect again and

261
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,870
again application update ation of those

262
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:45,220
soccer software aspect as well so this

263
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,839
is what the new evaluation and that's

264
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:49,480
what people talk about it's it's pretty

265
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:52,750
hard to secure and how this we can put

266
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,040
this block to one vendor only and rely

267
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:56,170
on them that they will do secure

268
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,990
security nicely so what has been changed

269
00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:00,640
if I look at this block so we had this

270
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:02,500
existing network on the left side so

271
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,220
basically we had a separated core

272
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:08,410
network and ran then we have a dedicated

273
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:11,320
IT hardware like each block was radical

274
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:12,910
ID ID block for example IT hardware

275
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,010
block and also we have a propriety

276
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:16,660
signaling protocols like ss7 or there

277
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:18,880
are many others but I just give example

278
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,110
of essa' 7 now of course you have a you

279
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,880
can gain a knowledge about those

280
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:23,790
protocols diameter but there are not

281
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,930
many people who understand those

282
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,219
straight-ahead for example other very

283
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:29,589
few people have knowledge of this and

284
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,810
then difficult to modify or create new

285
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:34,180
services on this block you can do it but

286
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:35,859
it takes one year time I don't know how

287
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,510
many people are work for a mobile

288
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,070
operator here but using existing

289
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:41,319
infrastructure is quite difficult to

290
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:43,180
start a new services until analysts like

291
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,699
vendor Nokia Ericsson provides you some

292
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:48,459
new additional blocks or something but

293
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:50,469
now if you look at new changes so we

294
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:52,599
have a still there is a separation

295
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:54,070
between core network an and ran but is

296
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,470
still less separated because then we

297
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:59,260
introduced this layer age analytics or

298
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:00,910
what you say H cloud for example your

299
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,800
connection from base station goes to the

300
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,660
straight to the edge cloud so it means

301
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,520
that it's going into the cloud straight

302
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,230
ahead and then you have a configure

303
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,110
configurable hardware and software in

304
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,640
the cloud and that's

305
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:12,440
what we have a programmable networks now

306
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,569
and one thing has been replaced

307
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,480
classically and drastically this is a

308
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:19,640
main change every protocol which we use

309
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:23,269
in ss7 diameter how many people know

310
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:25,579
about ss7 flaws and exploit diameter so

311
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:29,019
some people and now this has been

312
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:31,219
replaced with a rest-based java api I

313
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:33,860
mean you can imagine this is good thing

314
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:36,350
or bad thing or whatever it is and of

315
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:38,750
course there is a security there and you

316
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:41,149
use SSL and certificate whatever it is

317
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:43,519
but if anybody operator sitting in the

318
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:45,100
room if I ask I mean them question how

319
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,649
really do they really care about

320
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:51,890
internal SSL connections or IPSec within

321
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:54,140
their infrastructure do they deploy very

322
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:56,089
few yes I agree yes yes you should do it

323
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:58,670
but very people just say oh it's

324
00:11:56,089 --> 00:12:00,529
Internet just leave it and buying SSL

325
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:02,060
and IP six something else it's cost more

326
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:03,200
again and our management doesn't give a

327
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,239
permission or something like this so

328
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,649
let's have a plain text this world it

329
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,959
don't care about anything and that's

330
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:10,610
time gonna happen with Java rest-based

331
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,529
API is where authentication is also

332
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,940
based on authentication tokens how many

333
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:15,800
people really got bug bounty on

334
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:17,390
rest-based API source tokens

335
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,550
authentication bypass token something

336
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:22,339
like this just find out actually how

337
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:23,689
many people really got many on existing

338
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:24,980
cloud services I am NOT talking about

339
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:27,350
the web so we said but still on the

340
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:29,449
cloud because the Java basic pays also

341
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:31,310
use there and then you have an API is to

342
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:34,160
create new services for example on

343
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:36,709
existing Co network so these are some

344
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,480
challenging aspect it's still good I'm

345
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:40,819
not saying that it's a bad but it still

346
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,560
it brings new challenges for securing

347
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:46,160
the core network and let's talk about

348
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,890
some PI G some potential problems we may

349
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,300
see here on the radio side of course

350
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,529
then we have a device and base station

351
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,109
which talks to each other silly a

352
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:57,709
wireless medium security has been

353
00:12:54,110 --> 00:13:00,260
improved a lot so still but what we see

354
00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:02,630
that a classical design problem your

355
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:04,760
mobile phone is smart but it's a and

356
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:07,570
many people say smart means dumb but I

357
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:10,220
mean I use a term smart means slave

358
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:12,380
because your smartphone is a slave base

359
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:14,690
basically it just acts what base station

360
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,829
Said's and and this has been designed

361
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:18,199
such a fashion

362
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:19,939
if mobile if the base station says let's

363
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:22,050
use plain taste traffic or let's use

364
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:24,510
badly or

365
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:26,430
less secure algorithm your mobile phone

366
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:28,080
doesn't have any capacity capacity to

367
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:30,209
negotiate something it will just say

368
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,620
fine let's talk plain text because you

369
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:33,540
have the power so it's a master and

370
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,120
slave kind of configuration we have from

371
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:39,029
the architecture so is still same in Phi

372
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:41,100
G if the Phi G power says that I don't

373
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:43,709
speak Phi G let's speak to G it will

374
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:46,050
just speak to D no matter what so it's

375
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:48,000
just like this and very very few phones

376
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:50,790
give you freedom to lock your phone on

377
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,380
certain range or frequency like you can

378
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:54,029
open your mobile phone and you have

379
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:57,390
network settings that we can say that

380
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:58,920
only 4G or 2g 3G or something like this

381
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:00,180
year of this feature but not every phone

382
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,729
gives you this unique features for

383
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:06,510
example or very few phones only have 2 G

384
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:08,100
3G 4G or 4G 3G but no 4G only and I

385
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,149
assume that this will also happen for

386
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,740
fight you that you will not get only

387
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:12,720
fight you options to lock your phone but

388
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,310
again this lock mechanism is based on

389
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,550
what you see on the mobile device but

390
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:19,109
not at the end for example and then we

391
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:21,630
have a legacy network support and people

392
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:24,000
also talking about low latency many

393
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:26,339
people you you have heard about IOT

394
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,800
device on Phi G having a 10 year battery

395
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:30,480
lifespan so of course there has to be a

396
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,699
different kind of security mechanism at

397
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,740
that point as well and that also reduced

398
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,450
some security is there then we have a

399
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:40,500
classical bring down attacks what I said

400
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:43,110
Phi G phones can be bidding down to 4G

401
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:45,089
3G and classical attacks still sill

402
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:46,529
works there is on doing activity going

403
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:48,120
on how to tackle this problem in the

404
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:49,800
3gpp standardization body but we will

405
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,540
see what comes out then we have a

406
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,040
denial-of-service cell as on the radio

407
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,689
side and tracking an interception still

408
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,319
there even though we fix some problems

409
00:14:54,690 --> 00:15:00,990
with no networks and cloud already cover

410
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,060
those points every point on cloud

411
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:04,589
security virtualization third party API

412
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,029
security this is already a classical

413
00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:07,890
problem that we are tackling on the

414
00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:11,430
internet world and this has to be now

415
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:13,890
bring into the 5g networks as well due

416
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:16,050
to the adaptation of software's Asian

417
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:18,839
base service base architecture so this

418
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:21,000
is the sba what we adopted in the the 5g

419
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:23,760
core networks anyway so this is what we

420
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,560
know and this is one example I just try

421
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,329
to explain what this attack means or

422
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,219
what what something goes bad this is one

423
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:31,319
use case for example so assuming that

424
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:33,149
some mobile operating has been deployed

425
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,279
like this scenario you have a base

426
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:35,790
station PI G base stations for example

427
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,030
this way

428
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:40,650
and this is connected to a trout bass or

429
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:42,180
this could be the H cloud let's say this

430
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:44,459
is the H cloud before it go to the core

431
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:46,380
network and this cloud instance can be

432
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:48,960
protected using an hypervisor and then

433
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:51,750
you you run different slices for example

434
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,280
or a cloud slices and one slice could be

435
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,570
fun one particular serve is that what

436
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,000
what that's what you see in the

437
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:58,920
marketing term nowadays and this could

438
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,810
be for let's say smart grid national

439
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,209
smart grid or controller or a park or

440
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:04,829
power or electricity and one for the

441
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:08,100
normal mobile phone users and basically

442
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:10,050
you separate all these cloud instance

443
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:14,280
and this town if this means what let's

444
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:15,750
assume that the so for example so this

445
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,520
is the mobile phone and he wants to play

446
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,260
a game VR based game or something like

447
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:22,199
this so basically when he's trying to

448
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:24,510
access the service query goes from base

449
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,850
station to this block and they will

450
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:28,439
prioritize like this is the VR device

451
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:29,670
and he wants to be our service so

452
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,770
basically they will assign him this

453
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:33,360
cloud instance for example so rate I

454
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:34,650
will be handled by this for example and

455
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,420
this is normal phone and this could be

456
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:39,120
something like this right so point is

457
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:41,099
each slice will handle a data of

458
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,800
particular type of devices or it could

459
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,210
be let's say one one for autonomous car

460
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,390
for example we don't know this week um

461
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:50,790
but so every car it I will be handled by

462
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:52,590
one instance for example and then this

463
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:54,180
instance block will have will give they

464
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:55,560
will give access to let's say a car

465
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,540
manufacturer company or something like

466
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,819
this API and everything will be secured

467
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:02,130
with hypervisor and now we have to make

468
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:04,560
sure that nobody exploit a vulnerability

469
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:06,720
on hypervisor to get access here or

470
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,819
having the API or somebody's a smart

471
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,500
hacker who use mobile phone and he tried

472
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,179
to compromise some elements on here

473
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,310
having zero day off software or whatever

474
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:16,650
it is and you have to ensure that these

475
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:18,629
all blocks never really leaked any data

476
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:20,040
so that's what the challenge is again

477
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,510
when you use this kind of infrastructure

478
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:25,530
so this is what we have to protect in

479
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:27,150
Phi G having this part and now this is

480
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,950
everything is running in a cloud but now

481
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,930
I have a really nice example I use most

482
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:32,610
of the time basically this is about grip

483
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:34,530
Y attacking wiretapping scandal

484
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:37,770
how many people know this greasewood a

485
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:39,540
phone hacking scandal very few people

486
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:43,290
knows so what happened back in two

487
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:47,399
thousand five or six around there was

488
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:49,680
one critical software there was one

489
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,590
critical software basically every mobile

490
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,630
company has to provide an API or lawful

491
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:56,730
interception api's so what did what does

492
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:59,430
it means that your every mobile phone

493
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:01,200
call or SMS data what you use can be

494
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:03,300
tapped by the government agency as long

495
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,890
as they have a code warrant so you just

496
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,230
put any number into the system and that

497
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:09,150
phone will be live tap so you will just

498
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:11,700
record every communication call so this

499
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:13,590
is like in a FBI room order or

500
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,180
monitoring room for example it's a it's

501
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,949
a and it's a mandatory for every

502
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:18,540
operator to do this and there is a

503
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,910
special software for this you that you

504
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:22,110
have to build and there is a special

505
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:23,940
hardware and software and that has been

506
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:27,360
built by the mobile companies okay for

507
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:30,080
this and this software this machine was

508
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,949
not working properly in in Greece and

509
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,780
they couldn't figure out what's the

510
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:36,090
problem there so they call the engineer

511
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:38,310
from Ericsson and he came and he started

512
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:39,540
to investigate and he and he came to a

513
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:43,139
conclusion that this is not their

514
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:44,580
software and he said this is not our

515
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,080
softly running on the system somebody

516
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,610
has modified the software and put

517
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,840
malware or something like this and

518
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:50,729
that's what this software is behaving

519
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,550
stupidly and they figure out what he's

520
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:56,010
doing actually so there was a list of a

521
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:57,780
few of some mobile phone numbers are

522
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:01,020
being tapped to this channel

523
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:02,430
continuously without having any requests

524
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,930
from government or anything like this so

525
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:06,060
prime minister of Greece and some

526
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:08,850
ministry is called we're live tab by

527
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:13,080
this interface and the connection was

528
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:15,990
going to some embassies in in Greece so

529
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,399
you can imagine back that time 2005 we

530
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:19,410
don't know how these systems are

531
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,480
designed what system they are running

532
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:23,070
how the protocol looks like very few

533
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,660
people the telco guys knows actually

534
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:27,600
what he what interface looks like

535
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:29,730
somebody had a malware for this system

536
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,889
or machine 2005 and it was running

537
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:33,120
smoothly for 6 month until the Rickson

538
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:35,400
discovered something going wrong

539
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,870
my point is telcos do not have

540
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,570
infrastructure to detect something like

541
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:40,949
this so far he's getting better but

542
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:43,139
which we still don't have and this was

543
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:46,290
the case in 2005 and now we are talking

544
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:49,110
about putting these like machines like

545
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:50,399
these machines into a cloud and now you

546
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:52,709
have to trust that there is a cloud

547
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,330
something at least now that guy to

548
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:56,790
install a malware he has to come with a

549
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:58,770
USB stick or something tumour to modify

550
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:00,570
this machine now they don't need to do

551
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:02,830
this I mean as long as you run you own

552
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:04,389
the cloud I mean you can just do

553
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:06,159
maliciously modified those machines so

554
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:09,310
that's kind of difference we are talking

555
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,900
about now and and this is what kicks the

556
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:12,639
alarm that how many mobile operators

557
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:15,310
have a capability to do today detect

558
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,260
something like this that's a challenging

559
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:19,090
game and how do you trust the vendor as

560
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:20,740
well so this was the case with Ericsson

561
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:23,379
and still talking people talk about some

562
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:25,330
Chinese render again for example now I

563
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:27,190
mean how many people really claim that

564
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:28,510
okay Ericsson has really bad code that

565
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:30,670
somebody installed malware on this

566
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:32,710
machine 2005 and now we're talking about

567
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:35,830
one unique vendor and telling that their

568
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:37,180
code is really bad now we can compare I

569
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,530
mean what we're talking about the code

570
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:40,930
and whatever it is see but the point is

571
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:42,730
not every telco stack has been properly

572
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:45,270
fen tested I would say but I can't come

573
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:47,380
to the conclusion but still this is a

574
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:49,410
open ground which hasn't been done

575
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:51,670
properly pain tested something like this

576
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:52,860
anyway so these are like incidents and

577
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:55,930
then we also have the incidents like

578
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:58,689
there was a famous French company was

579
00:20:55,930 --> 00:21:00,850
pen testing a Belgian operator and they

580
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,680
were fuzzing some packets and by mistake

581
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:03,969
few fuzzing packets because every

582
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,610
operator is being connected to each

583
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:09,550
other the Sun beard request came to

584
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:12,129
Norway and due to that the main server

585
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:14,230
of our main component of every mobile

586
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:17,320
operator called HLR where all the data

587
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:20,260
is being stored of users what is was got

588
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,790
crash by mistake because they were not

589
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:24,120
able to handle two packets it got

590
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:27,070
crashed it took three days to recover it

591
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,750
so that's the kind of readiness we have

592
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:30,760
on the telco infrastructure when

593
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,680
something goes wrong and that case and

594
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,000
this is again some configuration

595
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,710
operational issues and still we get

596
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,090
outage time-to-time on the network and

597
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:39,100
there is a reason of software and miss

598
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:40,600
complication issues for example and now

599
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,889
we are talking talking about having this

600
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,179
in a cloud instance for example of

601
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:45,340
course we have reliability and

602
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:47,770
redundancy I'm not saying that but but

603
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:50,320
still we also have at this stage as well

604
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:53,620
and then we have a Snowden as well right

605
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,510
keys are being leak with gemalto was

606
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:57,820
being hack or something like this and

607
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:59,760
now we have a 5g devices in future with

608
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:02,980
embedded SIM card you cannot take out

609
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:05,020
and and you will change operator on the

610
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,670
fly like you when you change from what a

611
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,930
phone to orange for example you don't

612
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:11,080
need to go to store it will just happen

613
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:13,270
randomly automatically can you imagine a

614
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:16,639
case we have a phone you have a mobile

615
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:17,900
phone actually and you haven't subscribe

616
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,210
for any connection and certainly you get

617
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,740
internet connection and if it happens by

618
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:23,380
magic can you trust that it will happen

619
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:25,640
without knowing you as well

620
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:27,080
because at least to run my spume I'll

621
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,880
phone you I can put the SIM card right I

622
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,110
need to put the SIM card but in in

623
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,700
future I don't need to put the sim card

624
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:34,429
it's already there how can I assure that

625
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,990
it will not activate it because

626
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:38,300
everything comes with the encryption key

627
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:40,490
which is called OTA key over there key

628
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:42,320
and this is known with operator and

629
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:44,120
again we are talking about OTAs keys are

630
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,760
being stored or or securely handle for

631
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:49,129
example anyway and this will be Sameera

632
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:51,620
and then we have a different kind of

633
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:53,060
distributed attacks as well which when

634
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,469
you have a higher bandwidth speed but

635
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:56,419
this is quite logical I'm not really

636
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:57,920
focusing on but now he talks about radio

637
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:01,070
part let's talk about the radio part

638
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:03,080
what we have been working on and there

639
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:05,210
were some research we did past couple of

640
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:08,270
months there was two to research we did

641
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:10,220
on radio part about how still some phi0

642
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:12,110
do protocols which has been upgraded but

643
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,520
you can still make some attacks bringing

644
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:15,320
big base stations and you can still

645
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,629
attack those devices including IOT

646
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:19,370
devices as well and mobile devices and

647
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:21,470
also some Waka protocols which allows us

648
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:25,850
to build MC catcher 405-g devices and

649
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:37,580
now Altaf will start with with with

650
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:39,620
attacks over radio access networks ok so

651
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:41,179
we have seen that like pipe G is going

652
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:43,159
to be much stronger network like

653
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:45,200
obviously it has to be a bit more

654
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,390
stronger than 4G not a bit but like it

655
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,130
has to be obviously stronger than 5g so

656
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:51,980
something that we can actually get it

657
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:54,950
and get it off in 5 G's like the problem

658
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:57,050
of MC catching like the term I mean we

659
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:59,210
know that MC is something that's unique

660
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:02,330
for every subscriber so it's something a

661
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:03,920
unique number for every SIM card so in

662
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:06,199
5g what they're trying to do is like

663
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,940
whenever the device is sending the MC to

664
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,550
the network it's actually encrypted now

665
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:12,740
so basically no active attacker so

666
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:16,340
passive attackers can actually ask the

667
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:17,660
device for MC in plaintext but this is

668
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:19,970
something like implementation-dependent

669
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:21,530
so this is something optional so we

670
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:23,690
still have to wait and see like who

671
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:27,050
exactly implements this and then get get

672
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:30,500
rid of this problem so we started to

673
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:33,110
like okay now we are we lost the MC

674
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,640
lost the IMEI so some identities which

675
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:36,620
can actually help the attacker to

676
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:40,100
actually identify devices or subscribers

677
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:42,560
in the wild so we started to look are

678
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:45,500
there any other like methods to actually

679
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:48,050
exploit or try to fingerprint the users

680
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:49,580
and devices so the first one we came

681
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:51,649
across something like okay we started

682
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,730
looking and then we found some some

683
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:55,640
different methods like to actually

684
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:59,510
fingerprint so the first one is we call

685
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:01,580
it like capabilities so the term

686
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:04,010
capability is like of a device or a

687
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:05,720
modem let's say so when I'm talking

688
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:08,180
about capabilities I don't mean the the

689
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,980
processor or the screen or something so

690
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,810
I'm talking more about the modems like

691
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:14,240
what does the the capability of the

692
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:15,889
modem so for example there could be two

693
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,440
different type of capabilities for the

694
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:20,450
modem there could be core Network and

695
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,220
there could be like radio access so the

696
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:24,860
coordinate for capabilities this means

697
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:26,780
that these are related to what kind of

698
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:29,149
like security algorithms the device is

699
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:31,879
supporting or does the device support

700
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:35,660
like gsm railway or does the device

701
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:38,360
support v2 we support the v2 a hex car

702
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:40,760
car driving support or that's the device

703
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,800
support like phone calls SMS data so

704
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:45,110
there's like a lot of capabilities that

705
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:47,120
the device can actually support then on

706
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:48,649
the radio side so just by the name you

707
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,959
can see that it's something related to

708
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:53,030
the radio so it could be obviously with

709
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,830
the frequency bands then what kind of

710
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:57,560
like physical layer parameters and some

711
00:25:54,830 --> 00:26:01,340
new technologies like my mo and carrier

712
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:03,409
aggregation which actually bring the the

713
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:05,780
high speeds for LTE networks and I think

714
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:08,150
they will also reuse the same kind of

715
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:09,530
technology for like 5g to actually boost

716
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:11,690
the speed so these are some of the

717
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:15,800
capabilities of the devices and these

718
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:17,660
are actually designed by or or specified

719
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,460
by 3gpp standards and are actually

720
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:22,610
designed by the basement vendors and

721
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:24,260
then pushed into the phones so these are

722
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:26,780
some of the capabilities for like this

723
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:29,750
is a just Wireshark trace or maybe just

724
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:31,910
for some reference so some specific 5g

725
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:34,070
capabilities could be like v2x cars or

726
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:36,620
something cellular I what is specific

727
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:38,870
something which says like power saving

728
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:42,139
modes which is really especially useful

729
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:43,989
for narrowband iot devices so these are

730
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:46,300
actually defined or

731
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:49,059
mentioned or enabled and disabled in

732
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:51,309
these capabilities which are actually

733
00:26:49,059 --> 00:26:55,210
sent to the network so if we look now

734
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:56,740
when we turn on the device so the device

735
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:58,300
is like asking for a registration

736
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,950
request and then it's exchanging the

737
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,780
capabilities it's sending the coordinate

738
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:03,429
for capabilities for example if you are

739
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:06,129
turning on a phone it says that I'm a

740
00:27:03,429 --> 00:27:09,070
phone and then I need voice calling and

741
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:10,870
then data keep data support because I I

742
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:12,939
can actually handle them because I have

743
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:15,399
some codec support so I can actually

744
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:16,630
handle voice calls and stuff so it says

745
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,160
that then there is authentication

746
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:21,940
security very good

747
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:24,340
then then following that like the device

748
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:26,800
is sending its radio access capabilities

749
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:28,840
and then you see that there's an over

750
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:31,149
there security which is happening just

751
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,830
to protect all your data which is going

752
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:35,380
over there so this is something very

753
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:38,889
typical which happens in 4G and 5g

754
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:40,840
networks so the basic problem here is

755
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:42,400
like if you see the core network

756
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,209
capabilities are actually sent in

757
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,860
clear-text

758
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:47,500
before actually setting up the security

759
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:50,320
and also the radio access capabilities

760
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:52,420
are actually sent in plaintext before

761
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,309
actually setting up the security so we

762
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,780
found okay these are some two problems

763
00:27:54,309 --> 00:27:59,320
and then we can actually exploit and

764
00:27:55,780 --> 00:28:00,490
then see what can we get out of it so

765
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,659
like I said these are some of the

766
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:04,090
problems and then this could be

767
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:06,010
exploited in either passive manner like

768
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:08,709
trying to run a software radio and then

769
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:12,580
passively getting information on 4G and

770
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:15,040
5g networks then also trying to see or

771
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:17,350
like exploit them and then see what can

772
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,940
you do with that so we came out with

773
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:21,100
three types of attacks the first one is

774
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:22,690
like MN map this is almost similar to

775
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,760
the N map that we have in the IPE

776
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:26,559
traditional IP networks then we have

777
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,270
their bidding down attack and then a

778
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,580
battery day and attack which is mostly

779
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:32,080
focused on IOT networks and then but

780
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:34,419
these are mostly have to be a

781
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,340
man-in-the-middle so let's go with each

782
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:37,809
of them and then before actually doing

783
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:41,139
the attacks like we had to build a set

784
00:28:37,809 --> 00:28:42,970
up trying to really exploit the attacks

785
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:46,300
in commercial networks and then see how

786
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:47,650
they work so we came I think people are

787
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:49,809
today like familiar with

788
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:51,730
software-defined radio so we bought to

789
00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:54,668
do two software-defined radios us our

790
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:57,160
piece and then we had some open source

791
00:28:54,669 --> 00:28:57,820
software available from SRS LT so to

792
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,830
actually run

793
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:01,270
for G stack and then we could also

794
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:04,240
modify a little bit the core network

795
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:08,530
trying to implement new new 5g

796
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:10,540
capabilities so we build a whole man the

797
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:13,030
middle setup so basically it actually

798
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:15,159
has a road base station plus a road

799
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:18,010
phone which is actually routing the

800
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:19,810
traffic from the victim phone through

801
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:21,820
this device through the whole setup and

802
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:23,590
to the real network so basically the

803
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:25,419
whole traffic or the whole registration

804
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:27,490
procedure which you saw before is

805
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:29,830
actually going through this one and then

806
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:31,690
we see at certain points like you can

807
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:34,060
actually modify the traffic but doesn't

808
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:36,340
get detected on either side like neither

809
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:38,080
the phone cannot detect it nor the

810
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:43,840
network can detect it like some

811
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:46,149
modification has done so yeah the first

812
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,760
attack like the end map normally we are

813
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:50,560
aware of n map so it means like you try

814
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,270
to find live hosts on the network and

815
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,379
try to find what kind of like operating

816
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:58,000
systems they are running running

817
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:59,710
applications versions and then what kind

818
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,720
of ports are open so these are like the

819
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:03,940
typical functions we have so we try to

820
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,890
came up with come up with something

821
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:09,160
similar so you run a fake base station

822
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:10,870
or something or a passive device that

823
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,610
actually collects these capabilities and

824
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:14,500
based on the capabilities you collected

825
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:16,360
you try to identify like who is the

826
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:18,730
maker of the device the model the kind

827
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:20,409
of applications its running and also if

828
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:22,690
possible the kind of application were

829
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:26,170
operating system version and all this

830
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:27,670
information so so how we do this like we

831
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:30,880
spit if we specify like some kind of

832
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:32,410
like tree model so basically we try to

833
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,480
find first who is the basement

834
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:36,570
whether it's Qualcomm mediatek or Huawei

835
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,890
and then following that we try to find

836
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:40,419
what kind of chipset number is it

837
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:42,970
because every chips that you release has

838
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:44,320
a specific number so we try to find out

839
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:46,660
that number then if it's a cellular

840
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,250
device or it's an IOT device following

841
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:50,890
that if it's a cellular then it could be

842
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:52,270
a phone like what most probably but

843
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:55,330
there could be other type of devices

844
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:57,660
like routers USB dongles laptops and

845
00:30:55,330 --> 00:31:00,250
everything so if it's a phone obviously

846
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:04,960
we try to consider only like Android and

847
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:06,670
iOS we skip Windows and other so if it's

848
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,530
syn Android device we try to find like

849
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:11,350
who is the actual manufacturer of the

850
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:13,210
device like Samsung or HTC then

851
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:17,020
following that if it's an IOC iOS device

852
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:18,820
it could be either an iPad or an iPhone

853
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:20,080
or like and try to find what kind of

854
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:23,950
like operating system version it's

855
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:26,530
running in other type of devices like we

856
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:28,210
could also identify cars and railway

857
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:31,230
modem devices like differently because

858
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:33,910
their capabilities are different and

859
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:35,110
coming to the IOT side like we could

860
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:37,179
actually differ there are like

861
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:38,709
specifically two types of IOT categories

862
00:31:37,179 --> 00:31:41,679
defined in the standards one is like

863
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:43,510
narrowband IOT then which is like which

864
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,220
has super power saving mode capabilities

865
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:47,200
then on the other side like there is LTE

866
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:49,690
M which is used for like machine to

867
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,789
machine communication so this could

868
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:54,039
usually go into like home automation or

869
00:31:51,789 --> 00:31:55,780
agriculture or sensor so these are the

870
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:57,789
typical devices that use this kind of

871
00:31:55,780 --> 00:32:02,678
models so we could also identify like

872
00:31:57,789 --> 00:32:03,879
what exactly the device type is so if

873
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:05,919
you ask me like why is this

874
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:08,409
identification possible in two reasons

875
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,820
first one is like baseband manufactures

876
00:32:08,409 --> 00:32:11,740
like who actually implement these

877
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:15,340
capabilities because like all the

878
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:17,020
capabilities are not or not mandatory to

879
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:18,908
be implemented so you can actually

880
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:20,289
disable some of them or enable some of

881
00:32:18,909 --> 00:32:23,440
them it depends on the application

882
00:32:20,289 --> 00:32:24,879
that's using it so baseband vendors like

883
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,380
they also implement capabilities

884
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,450
differently like I said some of them

885
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:30,940
enable some specific ones some of them

886
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:32,740
disabled it then the second reason was

887
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:35,169
like each target application DIF

888
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:37,210
requires like different set of applicant

889
00:32:35,169 --> 00:32:40,000
set of like capabilities for example a

890
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:42,429
v2x car should really have this v2x

891
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,770
capability like enabled or else like it

892
00:32:42,429 --> 00:32:46,179
cannot activate or use this feature if

893
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:49,059
you take a phone it should really

894
00:32:46,179 --> 00:32:51,640
support this voice codecs or

895
00:32:49,059 --> 00:32:53,350
some kind of like data frequencies or

896
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,030
something so these are like really

897
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:56,799
essential and then this should be

898
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:59,289
supported by their by the device to

899
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:02,918
actually show that this application can

900
00:32:59,289 --> 00:33:05,200
actually work so what we did we try to

901
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:08,140
build a kind of like a reference model

902
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,450
so we collected like maybe up to 70 to

903
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:13,150
75 devices different type of devices it

904
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:15,640
they could be majority of them are like

905
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:18,250
phones some card modems some modems from

906
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:20,590
routers some what I'm some like USB

907
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:23,860
sticks then some devices from the

908
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:25,370
military some from vending machines

909
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:28,610
coffee machines

910
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:30,709
a lot of devices and then try to extract

911
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:32,959
the capabilities of this device like we

912
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:34,730
try to connect to our setup we have the

913
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,230
rogue base station set up we have then

914
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:38,240
try to extract these capabilities just

915
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:41,000
store them so when we are storing them

916
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,890
we try to store exactly by the name so

917
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,830
the name of it then what kind of like

918
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:47,990
who is the basement maker then who is

919
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:49,879
the like what kind of application it's

920
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:52,280
running so we try to store this in this

921
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:55,670
kind of model and then build a huge set

922
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:57,260
of capabilities so we try to like find

923
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:58,760
in this capabilities like something a

924
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:01,280
prince that actually allow us to

925
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,780
differentiate the basement because like

926
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:05,510
I was starting with the basement model

927
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:06,800
or the basement maker so if we look

928
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,910
closely like there are certain

929
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,949
capabilities which could actually

930
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:11,780
differentiate them for example if you

931
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:14,000
take like something called AI as zero

932
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:16,040
it's an integrity algorithm it's a null

933
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,560
integrity algorithm so basically all the

934
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:21,110
keys are zero so we found that only

935
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,449
Qualcomm basements have actually have

936
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:26,000
this null internal integrity algorithm

937
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:27,679
disabled rest of them are actually

938
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,690
enabling it all the time in all the

939
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,429
different type of modems we don't know

940
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:33,530
like what's the specific reason but

941
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:35,480
maybe Qualcomm could enable this feature

942
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:37,580
dynamically when somebody is making like

943
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:41,120
an emergency call or or this could be a

944
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:42,799
different reason if you take something

945
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,810
called extended measurement capability

946
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,670
this is something actually enable there

947
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:48,860
only in mediatek chipsets let's stop

948
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:51,110
them like disable it we do not really

949
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:52,610
know the reason because the problem is

950
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:54,950
here is like these are kind of like

951
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:56,630
optional capabilities so there's nothing

952
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:59,839
mandatory like the modem should

953
00:34:56,630 --> 00:35:02,450
implement them so once we know who is

954
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:04,370
exactly the the maker of this baseband

955
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:08,600
we try to just google it and then try to

956
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:10,670
find because like each each chipset has

957
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,080
a different name so and then it eat

958
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:14,630
chips it has a different kind of like

959
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:16,520
CGP release and it holds like certain

960
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:18,650
capabilities so if you just go to wiki

961
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,330
and then try to Google which exactly

962
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:22,580
this chips it is and then we can

963
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:24,590
actually find if you go to something

964
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:26,930
like Kirin 950 we can actually reveal

965
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:29,600
what devices are exactly using this

966
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:31,850
chipset so maybe it could it could list

967
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,319
out maybe up to 20 devices and then 20

968
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:34,970
of them could be different like some

969
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,340
could be phone from LG some could be

970
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:39,200
phones from huawei or some could be some

971
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:43,549
some other type of devices

972
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:46,129
so once we gather that information so

973
00:35:43,549 --> 00:35:47,780
the time that it's now that we identify

974
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:50,960
the application of the device like

975
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:53,510
trying to see if it's a phone or if it's

976
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,940
an iOS device or something so we have

977
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:58,099
looked even for your fingerprints for

978
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:59,470
that for example like these are some

979
00:35:58,099 --> 00:36:02,650
typical fingerprints to differentiate

980
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:05,480
cellular devices from the IOT devices

981
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:07,280
then we differentiate between phones and

982
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,780
other devices like there are different

983
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:12,770
voice capabilities that could be

984
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:14,480
differentiated then some typical

985
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:17,240
fingerprints like whoever iPhones

986
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,910
actually only use base pens from who I

987
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:21,649
devices then there's a there's like

988
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:24,920
mapping so Apple devices only use

989
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:27,740
chipsets from Intel and Qualcomm and

990
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:29,240
then so this was one one one of the most

991
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:31,279
tricky part like trying to differentiate

992
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:34,040
like I was an Android so there are only

993
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,770
certain GPS related capabilities which

994
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:40,069
are enabled in all Android devices but

995
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:42,230
are mostly disabled in iOS devices maybe

996
00:36:40,069 --> 00:36:45,380
could could be like for some privacy

997
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:46,760
reasons or so so but we found some

998
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:49,520
fingerprints that could actually enable

999
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:50,990
us to differentiate this one and then we

1000
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,819
also have like some specific

1001
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:55,669
capabilities that that can actually help

1002
00:36:52,819 --> 00:36:58,240
you to identify the the version of the

1003
00:36:55,670 --> 00:37:02,089
operating system but I'm skipping that

1004
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:03,919
so when we are doing this like map and

1005
00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:06,020
map like we have some issues for example

1006
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,420
the biggest issue could be SIM card

1007
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:10,309
could be the biggest issue so when you

1008
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:11,720
plug a different SIM card a different

1009
00:37:10,309 --> 00:37:13,700
set of bands or different set of

1010
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,709
capabilities are enabled depending on

1011
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:17,240
the configuration on the same card so

1012
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:21,790
this could be something tricky when you

1013
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:24,799
are doing this kind of stuff so

1014
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:26,509
something interesting what could be done

1015
00:37:24,799 --> 00:37:28,250
like okay like I said this could out

1016
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:30,260
disk they said that like you don't

1017
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:31,910
really need to be active it's also

1018
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:33,680
enough that you passively get the

1019
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:36,828
capabilities capabilities and then try

1020
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:38,509
to do the nmap and then you could link

1021
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:40,910
the MC to these capabilities and then

1022
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:42,950
try to locate or track in specific

1023
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:45,049
locations and then we are trying to

1024
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:46,598
share this kind of like all the traces

1025
00:37:45,049 --> 00:37:48,589
that we have in the tool we build

1026
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:50,390
because like all this stuff is being

1027
00:37:48,589 --> 00:37:52,640
done automatically so this could be

1028
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:53,000
useful for somebody like who is trying

1029
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,180
to

1030
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,960
find out what different devices are or

1031
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:02,180
yeah the second type of attack is the

1032
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:05,420
bidding down attack so like I said this

1033
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:06,799
is a man-in-the-middle based so we have

1034
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:09,620
seen that the capabilities are actually

1035
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:11,780
being sent to the network before

1036
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:13,910
actually establishing the security like

1037
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:16,390
over there security so what happens here

1038
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:19,069
is like being a man-in-the-middle relay

1039
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:21,200
I can actually modify the radio

1040
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:23,000
capabilities and then I I forward it to

1041
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,649
the network and the network believes

1042
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,330
that these are a real capabilities of

1043
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:28,850
the device and then it tries to save

1044
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:30,740
them and then it finish it completes a

1045
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:32,990
registration process so what exactly

1046
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:35,000
happens here is that when I'm modifying

1047
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:36,770
the capabilities I try to modify a

1048
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,960
certain specific capabilities like the

1049
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:42,259
category of the device like the category

1050
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:45,470
means like for example if you have and I

1051
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:48,590
was 11 it could be a cat cat 19 device

1052
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:52,250
but if you have like you know an iPhone

1053
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:54,530
6 it could be a cat 10 device so the

1054
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:57,710
higher the the version of the phone the

1055
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:59,510
the higher the category so I can

1056
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:02,360
actually lower the category set it to

1057
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:04,100
cat 1 cat 1 typically means that it's it

1058
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:07,040
belongs to the eyewall I were to device

1059
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:09,319
category and then I try to disable all

1060
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,790
the carrier aggregation and then my more

1061
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,950
features which are responsible for the

1062
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:14,660
high speed then we try to disable all

1063
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:17,270
the frequency bands then remove the

1064
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:18,740
voice or LTE capabilities like which are

1065
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:20,960
which is a traditional way of doing

1066
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:23,149
phone calls in in LTE networks which is

1067
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,510
comparatively more more secure than

1068
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:28,430
doing calls on circuit switched

1069
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:30,440
mechanism then we try to remove the v2x

1070
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:32,330
capabilities so by doing this you're

1071
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:34,070
actually telling the network that you're

1072
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:35,920
not supporting any of these capabilities

1073
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:38,690
and then you are actually trying to

1074
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,940
downgrade the the capability of the

1075
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:43,850
device so you are telling that this is

1076
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:48,470
not this is basically an IOT device but

1077
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:50,330
not or not a real phone so we try to so

1078
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:53,779
this is the this is a trace from one of

1079
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:55,460
the operator networks where we see the

1080
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:57,590
the security mode command is actually

1081
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:59,810
happening after the capabilities are

1082
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:03,440
requested from the or or received from

1083
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:06,990
the phone so we tried this kind of

1084
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:14,370
attack on I think around 30 32 networks

1085
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:17,250
it's the next okay so we try to do this

1086
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:19,020
attack on 32 networks and then we found

1087
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:21,840
that 22 of them are actually following

1088
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:23,400
the procedure of asking capabilities

1089
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,770
like before actually setting up any

1090
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,780
security so this gives more advantage

1091
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:32,009
for the attacker to modify them and then

1092
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:34,110
succeed with it so once the attack is

1093
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:36,990
done like what happens is like basically

1094
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:39,420
the phone is entitled to receive up to

1095
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:41,609
50 Mbps of speed but after this it would

1096
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:43,980
go back to like 2 Mbps or something so

1097
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:48,060
even lower depending on like high peak

1098
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:50,010
like high high peak traffic hours the

1099
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:51,779
voice or calls once or LT calls are

1100
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:53,970
denied so you'll be obviously pushed

1101
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:56,850
back to 2g to actually do the voice

1102
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:59,160
calls and then since the device is not

1103
00:40:56,850 --> 00:41:01,380
supporting any type of like LTE based

1104
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:03,629
frequency bands it would be pushed back

1105
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:07,350
to 2g to actually do the voice call and

1106
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:11,130
then or even during handovers like you

1107
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:13,529
would be downgraded so this is what's

1108
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:15,360
happening like you're actually telling

1109
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:17,910
the network that this is not a phone but

1110
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:20,160
this is an IOT device so your service is

1111
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:22,020
like somehow killed and then the

1112
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,970
craziest thing was like the capabilities

1113
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:25,830
are actually stored at the networks so

1114
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:28,109
which means that the network is storing

1115
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:30,630
modified capabilities for up to seven

1116
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:33,240
days or or until you restart your device

1117
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:35,340
so basically you require a restart to

1118
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:39,720
regain from this and then get back to

1119
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:41,910
normal service so you could ask me like

1120
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:44,339
okay why the capabilities are actually

1121
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:46,649
taken before then it like before the

1122
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:48,200
security this could be some there was

1123
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:51,750
like some reasons in the standards like

1124
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:55,649
this is just for early optimization like

1125
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:59,460
trying to get a better service or

1126
00:41:55,650 --> 00:42:01,560
connectivity for the device then we try

1127
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,970
to repeat similar kind of attack on an

1128
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:05,430
Arab and I were two devices where we are

1129
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:08,040
trying to remove the power saving more

1130
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:09,930
capabilities so the device tells the

1131
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,820
network that I would like to enable the

1132
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:14,129
power saving mode so basically the

1133
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:16,590
device is going in an off mode when it

1134
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:18,960
completes a registration basically it's

1135
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:20,880
sending only a few bytes of data so it

1136
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,609
doesn't have to be on all the time

1137
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,829
so it goes off but after the attacker

1138
00:42:23,609 --> 00:42:28,170
has actually modified them the device

1139
00:42:25,829 --> 00:42:31,680
actually never goes off and then it

1140
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:33,509
would stay alive for like maybe 13 days

1141
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,609
or something so basically during these

1142
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:37,589
13 days it's it's just monitoring the

1143
00:42:35,609 --> 00:42:39,869
signal strengths of nearby base stations

1144
00:42:37,589 --> 00:42:41,729
and then trying to waste its power so a

1145
00:42:39,869 --> 00:42:44,160
device like which is supposed to run on

1146
00:42:41,729 --> 00:42:46,348
to triple-a batteries for like 10 years

1147
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:50,848
is actually being killed in like maybe

1148
00:42:46,349 --> 00:42:52,380
up to within 13 days and then the other

1149
00:42:50,849 --> 00:42:53,849
problem with this device is like it

1150
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:55,799
requires a restart to actually get back

1151
00:42:53,849 --> 00:42:59,099
in normal service but I think it's

1152
00:42:55,799 --> 00:43:01,319
really impossible to actually restart

1153
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:06,900
IOT devices like which are located like

1154
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:09,089
far away so we'll see some of the

1155
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:17,849
attacks on akka protocol and then I

1156
00:43:09,089 --> 00:43:20,700
think the lobby will take all this yeah

1157
00:43:17,849 --> 00:43:23,940
this is about the radio side first and

1158
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:27,239
this is only about changing the message

1159
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:28,999
types and then you try to pretend to

1160
00:43:27,239 --> 00:43:31,829
device or reduce this speed for example

1161
00:43:28,999 --> 00:43:33,930
but now going little bit further or the

1162
00:43:31,829 --> 00:43:36,809
next protocol so what we can also do as

1163
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:39,149
well is basically what on top shows you

1164
00:43:36,809 --> 00:43:41,519
right now is before this level but now

1165
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:44,789
we talk about the next protocol sequence

1166
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:47,819
basically we're a mobile device sense is

1167
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:50,789
identity to the network and in Phi G

1168
00:43:47,819 --> 00:43:53,190
this identity is no longer MC and this

1169
00:43:50,789 --> 00:43:54,989
has been protected now so you can't

1170
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:57,269
really steal the somebody's MC over

1171
00:43:54,989 --> 00:44:00,150
there that's what basically classical MC

1172
00:43:57,269 --> 00:44:02,819
caches do so you won't lick here now in

1173
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:04,529
Phi G we have encryption on MC and then

1174
00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:06,779
no longer able to identify the device

1175
00:44:04,529 --> 00:44:08,640
but you can still make a fingerprint

1176
00:44:06,779 --> 00:44:10,200
based on this but now we have a second

1177
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,450
attack which allows you to detect a

1178
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:15,058
particular device without using this one

1179
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:16,439
then what is something new we're going

1180
00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:18,210
to talk about so basically we're going

1181
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:21,569
to steal the authentication material

1182
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:23,880
which is still in plain text okay so you

1183
00:44:21,569 --> 00:44:25,890
can still fetch those data from the

1184
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:27,539
network and you can exploit the

1185
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:30,150
resynchronize ation errors what you guys

1186
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:31,769
get from the protocol and this is like a

1187
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:33,269
part of attack vector so I'm not really

1188
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:34,649
going to make complicated but I will

1189
00:44:33,269 --> 00:44:36,479
just explain you in a short

1190
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:39,480
picture what the problem is basically

1191
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:42,120
okay and I explained a simple term now

1192
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:43,590
everybody does some security I believe

1193
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,970
the protocol you know so what happens

1194
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:46,920
basically you have a mobile phone and

1195
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:49,410
you talk to the network right and you

1196
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:51,930
say is hi this is me I want to talk to

1197
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:53,790
you right simple thing then network says

1198
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:54,540
okay you want to talk so let's have a

1199
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:56,400
challenge right

1200
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:58,170
I send you random number and I send you

1201
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,130
challenge and let's verify whether you

1202
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:00,630
are the right guy or not

1203
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:02,250
and you need to responds with the

1204
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:03,510
challenge response right and if this

1205
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:05,130
response is correct then you are

1206
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:06,540
authenticated and you can talk that's

1207
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:07,710
what that's what the protocol and that's

1208
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:09,420
what the same principle we used in

1209
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:12,060
mobile network and that's what we have a

1210
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:13,530
random number and a utn okay and now we

1211
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:15,630
go a little bit deeper what it looks

1212
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:18,120
like not going to explain more critical

1213
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:19,590
things but the point is the random

1214
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:22,319
number is just a random number the main

1215
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:25,680
key part is aut an authentication vector

1216
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:27,330
that consists of C and Mac okay and this

1217
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,850
has been constructed like this so

1218
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:33,000
Siemens C where C 1 C 1 means basically

1219
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:35,460
a sequence number XOR with a k so it

1220
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,440
means that this challenge contains a

1221
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:39,360
sequence number and the sequence number

1222
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,970
has been added to protect against the

1223
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:44,100
replay attack it's a logical right so if

1224
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:45,810
I am sending in my authentication

1225
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,250
channel and random number I need to have

1226
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:49,049
a sequence number so the next time it

1227
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:51,180
was replaying I should know that has

1228
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:52,470
been replayed so every device store the

1229
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:54,029
sequence somewhere ok this was a

1230
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:55,980
sickness number as it already use and

1231
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:58,080
somebody's trying to replay don't use it

1232
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:59,820
don't use it so sequence number plus 1

1233
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:02,400
for the next time right and this is what

1234
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:04,830
happens sequence number 2 XOR with a k a

1235
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:07,410
k is called an emetic key which is

1236
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:08,730
derived by some fashion so for this

1237
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:11,129
context just assume that this is the

1238
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:13,620
encryption key a k right now assume that

1239
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:15,750
this is the first block I do one random

1240
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:18,390
attack and I collect this authentication

1241
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:20,070
tokens for example and I basically gonna

1242
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:23,100
get a response like store which is in

1243
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:25,890
plaintext C 1 is equal to s qn s x or a

1244
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:28,290
k and after 2 hours i respond the same

1245
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:30,240
message to a 1 1 mobile same mobile

1246
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:32,100
phone i get a response because he's

1247
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:34,109
right now at sickness number 2 because

1248
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:35,490
he has made a number of phone calls or

1249
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:37,350
something like this his sequence number

1250
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:40,140
has been incremented now if I combine

1251
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:41,580
these two value C 1 XOR C 2 so basically

1252
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:44,069
you're gonna XOR the same keys values

1253
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:45,990
because it's the same key a K you'd get

1254
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:48,310
XOR it yet cancel out and what you get

1255
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:51,279
sickness number X or with secrecy

1256
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:55,450
- you get some value now we just need to

1257
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:57,580
use mathematical some equations to

1258
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:59,620
deduct some keys out of it can we really

1259
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:01,840
try to infer what is the sequence number

1260
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:03,339
exactly this mobile phone is and we came

1261
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:07,300
to a conclusion like if you do this

1262
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:09,250
attack actually we can certainly see you

1263
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:11,140
learn a some sequence bits of sequence

1264
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:13,540
number one or two so we can't really

1265
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:15,730
tell that okay this mobile phone is

1266
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:18,460
right now at 67 number sequence number

1267
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:20,770
okay and the funny thing is every phone

1268
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:22,930
has a unique sequence number and this

1269
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:25,270
allows us to learn exactly this is for

1270
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:27,370
example my mobile phone will always use

1271
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:29,560
always use sums unique sequence number

1272
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:31,180
and this has been designed such a way

1273
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:33,070
that every phone is been allocated some

1274
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:34,690
unique sequence number and actually I

1275
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:37,540
can always see that okay this phone has

1276
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:40,090
the same sequence and it gets +1 it's

1277
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:41,590
like 67 and 68 69 something so I always

1278
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:43,120
know the range for example and I know

1279
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:45,610
and what it tells me

1280
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:48,700
if somebody's try to attack on my phone

1281
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:50,470
I can see that right now I'm at 67

1282
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:52,750
number and if I do this attack tomorrow

1283
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:54,580
again for the talk let's say I use I

1284
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:56,530
made a 10 phone calls I use data

1285
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:59,500
connection so maybe my counter goes for

1286
00:47:56,530 --> 00:48:01,570
67 200 so it tells me that I use my

1287
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:02,890
phone for some calls or some data but if

1288
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:04,150
I don't use anything I can tell that

1289
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:05,950
it's phone may be switch off or

1290
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:07,930
something like this so you can predict

1291
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:08,950
some what exactly he's doing a call so

1292
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:10,480
you can try to make a service

1293
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:12,700
consumption or monitoring attack using

1294
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,830
this one so all these attacks has been

1295
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:16,540
informed to the 3gpp body so we try to

1296
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:18,759
talk with them last four and a half year

1297
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:20,500
so what alpha initially mentioned this

1298
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:22,810
has been quickly addressed because this

1299
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:24,910
was critical and then they said this we

1300
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:26,170
need to patch it so long discussion has

1301
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:26,589
been made and the standard has been

1302
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:30,460
fixed now

1303
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:32,530
so this battery drain counter and those

1304
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:34,240
capability reports should be only asked

1305
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:35,920
after the authentication so this has

1306
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,509
been fixed in the standard but still

1307
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,950
some early Phi G device which are

1308
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:41,170
already being roll out there they won't

1309
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:42,609
have this fixed right now so this will

1310
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:44,950
come only after three years all those

1311
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:46,660
fixes for example and this protocol one

1312
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:48,759
liability occur which we talked this

1313
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:50,200
this will get address so they are still

1314
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,510
discussing whether they should fix it

1315
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:55,299
because the point is this will only

1316
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:57,550
attack certain users if I want to make a

1317
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:59,380
dedicated tax on Altaf I can always

1318
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:01,180
track him but only certain users so you

1319
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:01,780
say targeted attack not a mass level

1320
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:03,850
attack that

1321
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:05,590
can do on any phone for example so I

1322
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:07,930
need to know many information about him

1323
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:09,670
already some authentication vectors from

1324
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:10,839
him to make the attack so it's a SIL

1325
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:12,550
target attack so they give a low

1326
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:14,290
priority from the standard but they are

1327
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:16,900
still discussing how we can address this

1328
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:19,390
problem in the phase 2 of Phi G or try

1329
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:22,660
to prevent and the same a couple tikal

1330
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:24,549
is been used in 2g s re 3G 4G and PI G

1331
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:26,230
so that's the same principle what being

1332
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:28,870
attack has been used in every generation

1333
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:30,430
from 3G yeah this has been mentioned and

1334
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:31,870
as I explained there is a DC the

1335
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:34,240
standard document that network should

1336
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:36,430
run the other see Yui capability and

1337
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:38,109
query only after the a is security and

1338
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:41,109
this has been the standard has been

1339
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:43,810
updated now and the information is also

1340
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:46,120
on the GSM a CVD program which is now I

1341
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:47,440
mean if you work in telco it's good to

1342
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:50,670
have if you found something on any

1343
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:52,990
mobile network so this is the

1344
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:55,930
responsible disclosure program for GSM a

1345
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:57,370
where you can report your findings all

1346
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:59,109
right and the fixes has been release

1347
00:49:57,370 --> 00:50:00,609
some of the operators we've been doing

1348
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:01,990
research we have been informed that this

1349
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:04,690
is a problem with your network and you

1350
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:06,040
should try to address some really they

1351
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:08,110
were nice enough to coordinate with us

1352
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:10,090
and they fix it some other got warning

1353
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:11,320
from the GSMA on this operator body and

1354
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,730
they inform all the operators in the

1355
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:16,450
world that this is the you should do for

1356
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:18,160
example and as I said that there are

1357
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:20,339
some new features in Phi G that

1358
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:24,819
increases the attack vector as well and

1359
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:26,920
also support of legacy systems like even

1360
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:29,140
if your Phi G the news networks or your

1361
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:30,400
device shoots also supports the legacy

1362
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:32,290
systems and then you have again the

1363
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:35,170
backward problems at the same time but I

1364
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:37,900
end on the note this is the statement

1365
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:39,250
from senato release one document and

1366
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:42,130
many people talking about national

1367
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:43,930
critical cyber war with phi g of blah

1368
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:45,700
blah blah or many things but they have a

1369
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:48,940
one interesting unique point actually so

1370
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:50,859
the natto C's Phi Z has an emerging

1371
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:52,560
signal intelligence platform for

1372
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:54,760
collecting and processing telemetry data

1373
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:56,620
now the thing I think some point they

1374
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,030
are still right even though you are you

1375
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:00,069
have a application end-to-end security

1376
00:50:58,030 --> 00:51:02,140
like I can't really see what data is

1377
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:04,810
being covered by Phi J device or any

1378
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:06,520
device but using a telemetry data I can

1379
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:09,430
still derive some intelligence out of it

1380
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:11,259
as long as you collect an N and PI G if

1381
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:13,810
every device is going to talk to each

1382
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:15,440
other over Phi G due to the low latency

1383
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:16,850
or high speed I mean I

1384
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,770
we weren't surprised that many people

1385
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:21,560
looking Pheidias a one unique single

1386
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:23,300
largest collection of data and then you

1387
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:24,410
try to derive some intelligence out of

1388
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:27,140
it so that's like a really interesting

1389
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:29,029
point or yeah I suggested to read this

1390
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:31,549
document which gives some highlights on

1391
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:32,930
on this line and we end on this note all

1392
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:35,410
on time I believe so and we have a

1393
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:46,430
question and answer for five minutes

1394
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:48,799
after this thanks Ravi thanks and thank

1395
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:51,020
you for the first attack Emin map you

1396
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:54,470
mentioned that there is also a passive

1397
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:56,720
attack available right like visible my

1398
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:58,730
question is do you still need a passive

1399
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:01,220
basis session or you can like passively

1400
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:02,870
a sniff tail for the signals yeah it's

1401
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:05,930
passively yeah you don't really need to

1402
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:07,940
run a base station so just you have to

1403
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:10,250
know like exactly which data you have to

1404
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:11,810
sniff then yeah from that you can

1405
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:13,850
actually infer if you have the model

1406
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:16,910
which we built and from then it's it's

1407
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:18,500
just feed the collected information just

1408
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:20,990
feed into this and then it will spit you

1409
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:22,940
out like the required information that

1410
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:24,979
you are looking for I mean the point is

1411
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:26,870
if you had any SDR device which has a

1412
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:28,820
capability which if you have any radio

1413
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:33,109
device which has a capability to decode

1414
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:34,460
the 4G or 3G channels and then and it's

1415
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:36,020
data is not encrypted so you can just

1416
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:39,890
dump out all the material that's what

1417
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:41,930
the passive means for example we use the

1418
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:43,520
base station SDR because that was easy

1419
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:46,310
enough but you can also do this attack

1420
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:48,200
on just having low cost radio module and

1421
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:49,520
just dump out all the channels that's

1422
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,740
also possible but again you have to

1423
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:53,480
decode those or filter the garbage get

1424
00:52:51,740 --> 00:53:01,970
out of it so it's just a complicated or

1425
00:52:53,480 --> 00:53:03,800
things mechs complicated yes yes it's

1426
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:05,509
only one integrator and the restive

1427
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:07,880
traffic we get it's encrypted but that's

1428
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:08,990
we can't really what is after the

1429
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,820
security session so that's not

1430
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:12,589
interesting for us for example usually

1431
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:14,750
like you find this capabilities like

1432
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:17,920
unencrypted so that was the basic

1433
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:23,140
problem of this one and then now I think

1434
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:23,140
will be fixed in the future devices sir

1435
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:31,050
do we have any more questions

1436
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:31,720
looks like that's it thank you guys okay

1437
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:35,630
thank you

1438
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:35,629
[Applause]
