really up in the air because you know

42
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:51,030
the case of the Malaysian flight yes we

there was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> militia bite and was blown</font>

45
00:02:54,060 --> 00:03:00,030
from Scott because transponders work so

<font color="#CCCCCC">transition</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> workers concave</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up right and</font>

48
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:08,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">the other thing is that the protocol</font>

protocol least you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember now and</font>

55
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:30,269
the pretty big problem is that it's

56
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:33,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">supposed to be in 2020 we all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get the</font>

58
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,440
incredible and it is the protocol as

59
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:40,319
used in between the plane<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the ground</font>

60
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:45,410
so the very<font color="#CCCCCC"> could say word applying</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the landing awkwardly</font>

was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a debacle that up you're using it is</font>

67
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:07,930
based upon nineties and imagine like the
