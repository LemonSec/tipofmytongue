17
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,720
since so I got a lot of customer

networks typical challenges over and

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,850
over in this this festival to this uh

20
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,658
this conference is very interesting to

21
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:23,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">the opportunity to learn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot out of it just listen to it so</font>

24
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:31,650
what I have to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about days what do</font>

25
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:34,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">you do when you identify hackers are you</font>

26
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,720
identify problems you never how you piss

27
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,658
off those hackers how do you control

28
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,950
what they have access to if you have

29
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:43,020
compromised equipment how do you control

30
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:47,490
what that<font color="#CCCCCC"> compost equipment has access</font>

31
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:50,229
to not the typical ways but name more

32
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:53,199
effective today we not ever

33
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:55,570
plays perfect all day I think we're

34
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,320
starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> now evolved to create more</font>

35
00:01:55,570 --> 00:02:03,100
effective means to fence off compromise

36
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:05,050
to quit so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to talk about a way</font>

37
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:08,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do that I refer to as a metadata</font>

38
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:10,410
approach generalizing that because it's

39
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:15,430
a few technologies in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> market</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

40
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:18,910
will apply to fencing off<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

41
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:22,480
compromised equipment using med and

42
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:24,520
every time so today you have a

43
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">compromiser quick machine you want to</font>

44
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:31,120
put you<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a quarantine them what's the</font>

45
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:38,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">best way to do that anybody use access</font>

46
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:42,120
list and vlans anybody the Lance<font color="#CCCCCC"> VRS one</font>

47
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:47,290
only one person doing VRS today too<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

48
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:49,240
the VRS and vlans are great but they

49
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:51,299
don't change us the access list that you

50
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:54,010
have to do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Matthew dude vlans BRS</font>

51
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,140
so you do a VLAN in brf can you isolate

52
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:58,000
your traffic and then you guys live it

53
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:00,329
up to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of the firewall or to</font>

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,670
the point of the switch or the router

55
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:05,890
where it is an access list and it's that

56
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:08,920
access list management of that access

57
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:10,480
list that's the real problem it's not

58
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,720
just being a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> foreign to them it's</font>

59
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:18,549
managing that access list and making it

60
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:20,920
easy and quick to change making<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

61
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:23,080
segmentation is easier to change so I'm

62
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:26,200
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about in this presentation have</font>

63
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:30,310
a segmentation with access list

64
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:32,649
configurations easy and quick to tonight

65
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:38,530
will maintain to add to subtract from

66
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:41,230
and to respond very quickly to rest so

67
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:43,930
questions that you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider going</font>

68
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:47,340
to this off how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you fence off</font>

69
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,340
machines pin economize

70
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,110
how fast you able to fence off those

71
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:57,679
machines if how fast you were able to

<font color="#E5E5E5">create a new group let's say a new</font>

contractor comes into your company you

74
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:03,870
need a fence off a section of the

can you do that how long does it take

anybody can you type you get it monday

79

take weeks to get new segment side to a

85

collect all those IP addresses

102
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:34,110
strict address planning I've got in my

103

they come up and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it fits thrifty of all</font>

106
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:46,049
their IP addresses and and they can

107
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,870
summarize these and it blocks and apply

108
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,910
to the blocks to the access list nobody

everybody quickly

110

are not fenced off properly so whatever

120
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:21,380
we could get off without relying on IP

quarantine segments if every one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

152
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:45,590
those segments has a virtual router and

153
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:47,719
every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> router in the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">infrastructure the currency</font>

155
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,400
technologist or at least sometimes we

156
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,270
can aggravate some of those of the edges

157
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:59,539
using velocity<font color="#CCCCCC"> process but we still have</font>

158
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:00,979
this act as less policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and my</font>

159

160
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:07,220
make your quality button yeah there it

161
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:08,960
is so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> access list is very extensive</font>

162
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,670
it just goes on and on and<font color="#CCCCCC"> on these</font>

163
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,799
become very much because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're looking</font>

164
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:15,230
at here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is so that's where we are dead</font>

165
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,240
every router has vertical edge routers

166
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:20,360
every switch has birth Lester's home

168
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:27,020
unique sub down on you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a deal in</font>

169
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:32,900
a segment you got it Adam no sup you get

170
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:34,579
a double your f another vertical rock so

171
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:38,360
let's cover what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with the metadata</font>

172
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:41,510
approach we're changing to more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

173
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,909
desired policy versus a long complex

174
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:47,210
access list with IP addresses you want

175
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:50,510
to dignify who can talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them you want</font>

176
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:54,440
identify who can access to protected

177
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:57,800
assets and micro operations can personal

178
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:00,200
chain or vegetable basket and then how

179
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,620
systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> use off each other you want to</font>

180
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:07,580
apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> that desired policy to a matrix</font>

181
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:10,490
the dividers here we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have employers</font>

182
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:14,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">manage asset for you BYOD which is a</font>

183
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:17,150
personal asset employer with an unknown

184
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:19,580
personal asset and then engineer video

185
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:22,670
system planet this excess and production

186
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:24,620
server to Devon serves a net access so

187
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:29,449
we went to policy really look at this<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

188
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:31,940
we match up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wine ecology come up</font>

189
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:35,060
with an honor of mint and then we want

190
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:38,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">to apply this this matrix the air switch</font>

191
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:41,689
router firewall indefinitely

192
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,660
individual and it had that I am walking

193
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:46,670
back because now we kind of meta dad in

194
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,319
the packet it doesn't matter bird of a

195
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:50,540
guitar doesn't matter one of the policy

196
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,120
is because of the packet when it was a

197
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:56,449
rich kid isn't as<font color="#E5E5E5"> tagged context to me</font>

198
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:59,360
it is tagged<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these groups which was</font>

199
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:02,149
tested which groups<font color="#CCCCCC"> didn't pack hang</font>

201
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:07,550
you see fit you can define<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I think</font>

202
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,670
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> rad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shirt personalized an</font>

203
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:15,140

204
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:17,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">manage it so that becomes pretty</font>

205
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:20,360
flexible so let's let's look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

206
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:23,839
action what's possible so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

207

employed agree an iphone on a Wi-Fi

209
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:30,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">controller and we have above there's the</font>

210
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:34,899
wireless LAN controller identity<font color="#CCCCCC"> server</font>

211

214
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,149
identity services engine gets their

215
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:47,149
credentials and it is a lot of other

216
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:49,910
information about the device<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it</font>

217
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:53,089
takes an<font color="#CCCCCC"> impostor of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us it takes all</font>

00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:58,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">that information and it correlates it to</font>

219
00:10:53,089 --> 00:11:01,610
a user group that you've defined so here

220
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:03,890
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> know is an Apple iPad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> users marriage</font>

221
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:09,250
is an employee and it's not a forward

222
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:12,260
asset so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be the nice server</font>

223
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:14,680
applies a personal assets cure to the

group tagging at the head<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a combat</font>

225
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:22,040
16-bit long it's a clawed into the

226
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:24,860
values what happens is the tag gets sent

227
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,360
down from the controller to the switch

228
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:29,450
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case it just stays at the</font>

00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:32,209

230
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:37,459
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it comes across</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our food</font>

234
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:48,089
they get tagged with Sgt value<font color="#CCCCCC"> aneta dad</font>

235
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:51,040
now what<font color="#CCCCCC"> can we do with that we can</font>

236
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:53,500
forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> that personal asset that's not</font>

237
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,860
registered from accidents or so the

238
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:59,800
access was on this which says<font color="#E5E5E5"> nope no</font>

239
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:02,560
personal assets a lot that educated<font color="#CCCCCC"> tab</font>

240
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:05,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">his bluff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ha but it is a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

241
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,689
opportunity so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is NASA this list</font>

242
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:10,330
here now the rest of the network in

243
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:12,760
America you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of one VLAN one of</font>

244
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:14,350
the are out in the entire network we

245
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,110
don't have to create all these multiple

246
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:19,210
over lights everywhere multiple control

247
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:21,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">coins</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everywhere</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a very simple</font>

248
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:23,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">network we just start tagging all</font>

249
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:28,449
packets in our access lists are

250
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:31,690
implemented based in attack so we're

251
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:34,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a little organization you</font>

252
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:36,790
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> locations</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that everywhere this is</font>

253
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,490
where access<font color="#CCCCCC"> lists be come from so we're</font>

254
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:42,969
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at a now that's currently</font>

255
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:45,400
done with the little on multiple global

256
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:48,390
locations to access a data center and

257
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:50,890
health it'll be done with the metadata

258
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:52,449
so here the traditional security

259
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:54,819
administration you have a part of our

260
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:56,470
wall ruled a firewall between the

261
00:12:54,820 --> 00:13:01,240
sources and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the destination this is a</font>

262
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:03,430
car walls new data center each location

263
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,589
here in New York has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a series of</font>

264
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:07,209
subjects member at olga's the sub

innocent aren't handed out in<font color="#E5E5E5"> block sir</font>

266
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:11,050
handed out sequentially so each

267
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:14,680
locations got quite a few different

268
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:17,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">subjects you dealing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with so those</font>

269
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:20,650
subnets are organized into a an object

270
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:24,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the viral and then the firewall</font>

271
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:28,329
applause policies to the objects so we

272
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:31,180
have a multi-year that allows each each

273
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:34,620
remote global site access to the

274
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:37,390
specific services in the data center

275
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:40,570
what happens when you added<font color="#CCCCCC"> added</font>

276
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:42,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">Sanders out here you have to go in the</font>

277
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:45,860
narwhal policy have to add a source as

278
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:48,050
many lines as the policy call for ya

279
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:50,690
added for every remote site that you add

280
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:53,810
so this is step one what text in time

281
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:55,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're adding in today's network now I</font>

00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:02,690
and every access list where my reside in

285
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:06,589
the network what happens when you add a

286
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:07,910
destination we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add another all</font>

287
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:11,029
we did was we added a couple of our

288
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:14,420
solutions for a new destination you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

289
00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:16,430
to add additional<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy so you can see</font>

290
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:18,740
every virtual machine you add you now

291
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:21,019
having to go back and modify policy or

292
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:23,000
tomorrow walls this is what takes so

293
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:25,130
much time you have too many

294
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,870
organizations managing in all<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

295
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:31,700

all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the change control process so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

have you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the large tanks as</font>

298
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:40,810
I said idea would have dedicated larger

299
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:44,720
bed resources just to manage is horrible

300
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:47,599
so there are concepts for the time so

301
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:53,000
with security group filtering you met at

302
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:54,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">the chaotic to motor the firewall the</font>

303
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,220
policy becomes very simple and it

304
00:14:54,769 --> 00:15:00,589
doesn't get changed so you identify when

305
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:05,329
I allow your employ the access

306
00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:07,399
production servers only allow them to

322
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:55,870
those dating sites earlier is we're

323
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:58,030
in ideas but once you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a copy of the</font>

324
00:15:55,870 --> 00:16:07,020
miss your policies become a much much

325
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:08,920
simpler so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some examples of</font>

and unregistered personal assets

330
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:24,060

considered classification the router in

tag<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes in it's probably 80 at a bar</font>

341
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:53,710
will have an enforcement point that

342

choose to drop or allow the data centers

00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:02,589
which is another important point those

<font color="#CCCCCC">at that either or the Tabard or creative</font>

this policy wherever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to the tag</font>

access development server tonight and

355
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,310
here's another<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of what do you do</font>

00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:35,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">with out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of acid or where you up what</font>

00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:37,659
you want to order your service masses

each other about the human resources

<font color="#E5E5E5">server should an access development</font>

development server tonight drop the

packet and it doesn't matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

365
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:59,070
tears<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have it not matter</font>

366
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:01,830
as you have you might have 200 as

367
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:05,189
sinners like I didn't like boarded us

368
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:10,290
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had this policy you</font>

369
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:11,820
can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> applauded generically campus and</font>

370
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,470
branch segmentation so this is an

371
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:16,740
example where one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the important point</font>

372
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:20,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">head</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ranks wish any why would you</font>

want that well maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to apply</font>

374
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:28,290
monitor for malware and grants wishes so

375
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:31,199
as traffic's crossing from employers to

376
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:34,409
employees you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> monitor or malware</font>

377
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,600
and known signatures and if you mash

378
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:45,140
those non signatures then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got a</font>

379
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:49,260
package so here we show an example of

380
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:51,840
extra cars we have employees lawyers gas

381
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:54,629
and a non-complying non-compliant would

382
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:58,169
be the official class of a segment for a

383
00:18:54,630 --> 00:19:00,660
device has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been compromised or this</font>

384

vulnerability Congress you know he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

385
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,740
hatched so the device is not going to

386
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:06,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">pass so you want to keep that photos</font>

387
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:10,310
devices segmented off you want to keep

388
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:12,989
them you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to identify them with</font>

vulnerable<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can't do that necessarily</font>

391
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:19,230
when they plug in and get an IP address

392
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:26,010
where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> belong</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in IP addresses</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but we</font>

00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,909
it through or from employees all other

400
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:47,100
trashed at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tester important then when</font>

401
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:48,990
we add a wireless LAN at campus we just

402
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,490
had we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> continue tagging the packets</font>

403
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:52,260
at that point they're trying to access

404
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:57,660
the campus that the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> center and</font>

405
00:19:52,260 --> 00:20:00,300
their their packets are several insane

406
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:02,370
a policy of the data center switch so

407
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,960
the non compliant devices the packets

408
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:08,580
will reach to that data center any be

409
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:10,800
discarded so it's regardless<font color="#CCCCCC"> apology</font>

410
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,800
very simple ah see now you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

411
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:18,090
worry about<font color="#CCCCCC"> acknowledging</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's a</font>

412
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:19,590
huge savings here's a byob this one is

413
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:27,149
overused terms bring your own device

414
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:29,040
personal assets<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming in to a DCI or</font>

415
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:32,280
PCI compliant network so you want to

416
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:34,800
keep your your cash registers and all

417
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,210
your devices and I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> better guarded and</font>

418
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">isolated from all the other devices</font>

419
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:40,710
anyone audacity they've done the same

420
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:43,950
way so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we can do is we can create</font>

421
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:46,620
tags or security groups for the pain

422
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:49,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">assistance so what there's security</font>

423
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:51,570
group<font color="#E5E5E5"> am systems you can now simply from</font>

search<font color="#CCCCCC"> business and then we can also</font>

426
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:06,120
knew the same type of filtering the ants

427
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:08,130
and I mentioned earlier instead of doing

428
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,929
all the important important as we can

429
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:12,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the important points and then in</font>

430
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:13,800
course which it was just an access list

431
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,150
the access lists are all they were doing

432
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:20,669

00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:24,750
is the same policy that it was a lot of

you wanted to today it's not viable not

443

00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:57,390
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> apply to access which is it in</font>

455
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:41,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">very question what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prevent a</font>

458
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:50,700

459
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:55,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have that with a lot of that is you</font>

460
00:22:50,700 --> 00:23:00,659
averted hop hop so this system

461
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:03,929
implementation med included Maxo so

462
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:08,010
between researchers and between

470
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:57,610
so if you asked about overhead yeah it

471
00:23:53,170 --> 00:24:04,180
would be too much overhead yeah when you

what happens slide is the AC audiences

using the application for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a more</font>

543
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:52,889
efficient so that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's all I had</font>

544
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:56,279

I know you guys diligent about you a

549
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:13,080
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know this is one layer of security</font>

550
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:14,519
this is not an end-all be-all it's not

551
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,710
good that all the other prisoners has

552
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:18,659
been the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey just go up our wall up</font>

553
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:20,789
there doesn't mean to protect if

554
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:26,249
somebody compromises it puts it a bomb

555
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:27,419
on employee machine and they are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">access the employed machine and then</font>

557
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:30,659
appoint machine can get to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

558
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:32,129
well that employee machine checks in

with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> master controller over a</font>

legitimate authorized so the best thing

561
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:40,309
to do is don't make good don't get that

and you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> done everything possible to</font>

566
00:28:51,869 --> 00:28:59,009
prevent an attack so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a letter to</font>

567
00:28:55,529 --> 00:29:02,960
help that to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make your protection much</font>

568
00:28:59,009 --> 00:29:02,960
easier much less expensive

question so what ago this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just more</font>

576
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,010
on the engine compartment right and I

577
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:28,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">can't either in two countries a source</font>
