to learn programming skills as part of

118
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:56,520
the new mac address so it went from 989

119
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:59,640
right there it<font color="#E5E5E5"> also created us some</font>

useful stuff such as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous time</font>

actually used toyota vios whenever

127
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:22,080
especially you have I'm not most<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say</font>

investigate that<font color="#CCCCCC"> host further and say oh</font>

135
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,810
gives you very useful information<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

136
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:46,739
then drill down further and be like

to calm these keyboards you can specify

about this program

191
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:21,710
it's a it has a certain language similar

192
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:24,560

also features<font color="#CCCCCC"> a nominated is detached</font>

and the other detection methods it it

00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:38,150
will detect a sequel injection attacks

197
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:40,790
and atopy brute force attacks so it's

198
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:43,550
very very useful a few other security

it's very very powerful like I said and

246
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:49,510
tell you when i draw all traffic so this

247
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:52,860

very<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy and very cheap to try these</font>

284
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:38,510
tools out and more it's very good

285
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:43,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">morning too so only these tools will</font>

286
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:50,840
help make your network more secure we

287
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:53,540
have any questions yes how many

288
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:56,960
concurrent applications can the pie keep

289
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:59,270
up with on a small network um I've

290
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,950
actually been really surprised it

291
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:04,189
actually does it really well with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

292
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:06,170
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of concurrent connections on I</font>

293
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:07,790
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any specifics on that but</font>

294
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:10,819
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been able to run most these tools</font>

295
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:14,900
with a very low load average so I'd say

296
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:18,260
it keeps up with a fairly well can you

297
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:20,930
give the USB dongle<font color="#CCCCCC"> for Ethernet we've</font>

298
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:25,160
given interval of you know intellectual

299
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:27,170
interface I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I mean it depends</font>

300
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,910
whether they r ask ian has that driver

301
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:31,160
built in but<font color="#CCCCCC"> for most I believe it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font>

302
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:33,560
I have one<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you can okay so yeah</font>

303
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,709
people maybe we will soak a dirge your

304
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,479
hitch right here yeah so also with that

305
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:40,340
you can run something like snort where

306
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:47,630
you have two interfaces one in that one

307
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:50,120
out you know I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that yes um I</font>

308
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:54,860
just use the default Brad universe

309
00:14:50,120 --> 00:15:00,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">really well you can also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hit Santos nay</font>

310
00:14:54,860 --> 00:15:03,080
an immediate Dora yes did you say a lot

311
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:04,189
of the students your age are very

312
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,320
interested in the linux so they

313
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:08,300
interested in sort of thing how to

314
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,090
change of popularity exceptions doesn't

315
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:13,609
look that well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm trying to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> change that</font>

316
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:17,720
I kept trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get out individuals um</font>

317
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:18,980
I hope it's getting traction I I

318
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,510
specifically haven't done any research

319
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,070
but i'm i'm trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get out in the</font>

320
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:23,689
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was just from your</font>

321
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:25,700
knowledge in terms of our students

322
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:27,140
taking this awfully interested is this

323
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,510
real easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know flip open their</font>

324
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:32,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">iPad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and not about it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think they</font>

325

should whether they are not

326
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:38,940
is a different story but<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I think once</font>

327
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:40,619
they actually use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a little bit it</font>

328
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:44,279
will be very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very powerful and it would</font>

329
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:45,899
gain an interest in you know in a

330
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:47,670
position where we're hiring students

331
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:50,220
doing them on and there's an abundance

332
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:51,300
of kids that feel they know computers

333
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,440
because they use them but they don't

334
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,910
really know what's going into the hood

335
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,830
we're really starting over with them

336
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,899
when they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to grow a courses so it's</font>

337
00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:00,060
refreshing to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> you speak to this</font>

a couple years it's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> app setup</font>

340
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:11,870
for testing in math I<font color="#E5E5E5"> do know how I</font>

341
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:20,610
usually just run it on my home network

342
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:22,320
but a lot can be very easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> seriously</font>

343
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:25,529
learning plus supportive would you say

344

with this kind of information with this

346
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:34,200
