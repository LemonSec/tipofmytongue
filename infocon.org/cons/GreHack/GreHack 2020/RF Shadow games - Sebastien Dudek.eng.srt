1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,679
hello everyone and thank you for taking

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,960
this talk i'm dex sebastian and today i

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:06,798
will talk to you about

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,639
air of shadow games the art of catching

5
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,400
error spy bugs

6
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,079
you can find me on twitter using the

7
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,920
flux juice ammo researcher at the track

8
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,079
micro company and i've also found that

9
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,119
my company named methods i specialize in

10
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,038
radio communication and hardware

11
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,840
today i will talk to you about error spy

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,160
bugs alpha's error spy box

13
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,240
are a real thread today because actually

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,560
you don't know for example here

15
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,759
if like um a simple cable like that

16
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,760
could be legit or not

17
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,040
and also if like a box like that is

18
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,079
paying on you or not

19
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,519
or this down girl if you can trust this

20
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,040
kind of danger or not

21
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,360
so this is like

22
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,360
something that i wanted to talk to you

23
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,559
about how to identify

24
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,760
such uh such um i mean

25
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,399
such devices or such cables that can

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,680
communicate

27
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:02,399
over the air what can what we can do

28
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:05,519
with some software definite radio etc

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,280
so the identity for today is to just uh

30
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,640
give you like a very quick introduction

31
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,119
to wireless uh

32
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,840
communications um present you some

33
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,080
boxing

34
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,119
implants um using the wireless

35
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,080
communications

36
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,360
ways to trap also some rf spy bugs and

37
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,158
also

38
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:27,520
talk to you about some inspected devices

39
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,840
radio frequencies so um as you can see i

40
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,280
have

41
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,880
a lot of history and today uh you know

42
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:38,159
then um because i mean thanks to

43
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,119
the dsp because now we know we are using

44
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,360
a lot of

45
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,320
a lot of mobile phones wireless delete

46
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,920
or television

47
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,158
satellites etc so um you know earth

48
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,960
it's present everywhere and thanks to

49
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,200
dsp

50
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,839
we use that a lot to communicate etc

51
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,719
but it's also a good candidate for earth

52
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,759
spy bugs

53
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,240
uh because actually um when you want for

54
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,040
example

55
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,920
a bugs or an implant to communicate over

56
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,600
the year

57
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,520
um is like much better than just using

58
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,640
like a simple wire that can be

59
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,840
just spotted very easily

60
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,879
and the problem for us is that

61
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,120
there is like no visible wires so i will

62
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,560
have at some point try to interface with

63
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,040
some sort of signal that is sent over

64
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,599
here

65
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,599
like for example here is like a linear

66
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,599
policy that's a significant

67
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,760
electromagnetic wave that we can

68
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,280
interface with with the right antenna

69
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,560
for example

70
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,200
and what is important is also to notice

71
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,040
that we have

72
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,560
at some point you know the frequency

73
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,519
that is used by this

74
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,959
senior in order to uh to capture the

75
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,519
communication try to do

76
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,840
to see the signal or to interface with

77
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:55,120
this community

78
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,680
and the first thing that you have to to

79
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,959
use when you want to scan or you want to

80
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,040
see what is in the air

81
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,239
is like a spectrum analyzer you can find

82
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,920
some spectral analysis

83
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,400
like the order short one that you can

84
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,319
see here that is pretty expensive

85
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,720
or there are also others like the rf

86
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,440
explorer that i will also hear

87
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,400
uh that here is scanning on the wi-fi

88
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,599
frequency

89
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,599
just right now and that costs like a

90
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,319
hundred euro or 300 euro

91
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,839
uh it supports uh some frequency but the

92
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,000
resolution is like you know

93
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,680
not very good compared to the radiators

94
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
but it's okay you know

95
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,599
if you want it's like a very cool gadget

96
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,319
to have if you want to just

97
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,000
put some some frequency that um that are

98
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,920
around

99
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,480
but you have also other ways like using

100
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,679
your sdr uh with jqrx um

101
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:48,560
hsdr or you have like a sdx which is

102
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,560
like a software that is

103
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,959
very well maintained as well as jqrx

104
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,439
um and that using a software definite

105
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,080
radio software definite radio device

106
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,840
and we have to know that before software

107
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,519
definite radio it was really difficult

108
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,200
to have like um to

109
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,840
have an idea of what was going in the

110
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,760
air because you had like to uh maybe

111
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,480
make your own uh i mean your own

112
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,359
equipment to scan to a specific

113
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,358
frequency

114
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,280
or get like a very uh expensive

115
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:23,039
equipment that is about to

116
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:26,479
turn to several frequencies and today

117
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,440
it's really accessible and what the the

118
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,758
sdr

119
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,520
gives you is just for example the sdr

120
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,479
allows you to tune to several

121
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,758
frequencies

122
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,520
and uh what it will do is that it will

123
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,880
do the conversion to analogic to a

124
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,240
digital then

125
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,719
pdf rf amplification etc and provide you

126
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,520
only some samples that you can work with

127
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,000
like yeah

128
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,440
you can modulate you can uh encode you

129
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,479
can decode et cetera you can

130
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,280
process the samples that are there i

131
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,719
mean the

132
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,440
software definite radio device gives you

133
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,199
and there are like more than 100 hdr

134
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,520
devices um

135
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,199
if you look at uh for example at

136
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,880
wikipedia page

137
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,840
if you look at the sd devices in

138
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,159
wikipedia you will see like plenty of

139
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,000
devices but there are also cheap

140
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,680
idea devices so if you don't know

141
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,479
anything about sdr you can

142
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,120
always buy one for 15 euro likes or this

143
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,919
one

144
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,680
and this one is pretty cool because it's

145
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:28,719
really cool for example to begin

146
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:30,800
with a such a cheap hdr device

147
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,400
so now let's talk about in-notifying

148
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,160
arrest by a box implant

149
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:39,198
so if we look for example at

150
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,080
our cable they look pretty legit a bit

151
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,800
so

152
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,080
you have to know that once we we plug

153
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,560
them for example if we

154
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,840
plug this um this implant which which is

155
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,400
like the

156
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,198
the origin director we can for example

157
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,440
see that

158
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,360
at some point you will see a spike that

159
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,840
will be

160
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,960
higher than the other one you have

161
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,198
scanned before

162
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,120
so at some you know at some points you

163
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,520
have to start with um and

164
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,960
here we can just unplug it but at some

165
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,000
point you have to start

166
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,638
fresh with um i mean with nothing

167
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,960
plugged

168
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,680
and then plug the device and wait a

169
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,758
little

170
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,520
bit and then you'll see maybe like a

171
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,840
spike that is higher than the other

172
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,159
frequency

173
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,000
but the the problem with that is that

174
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,560
at some points we are also trying to

175
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,600
scan the 2.4 gigahertz frequency which

176
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,759
are

177
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,639
really noisy because there are wi-fi a

178
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,680
lot of wi-fi networks etc you have also

179
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:38,639
bluetooth devices etc so it's like

180
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,000
uh really noisy but there are also

181
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,880
plenty of way because

182
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,840
as you can see here we can for example

183
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,360
just

184
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:50,560
plug the cable here

185
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,520
um as it's used probably the icm lens

186
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,720
uh we can try to scan for some uh

187
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,120
bluetooth devices

188
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,800
first or wi-fi devices uh using for

189
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,240
example aircraft i mean

190
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,360
airmon etc but here it's bluetooth so

191
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,720
we'll see that maybe

192
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:10,400
here we can see like

193
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,560
a device drawing here called ninja

194
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,840
and if we implement the device we can

195
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,680
see that this device

196
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:20,719
will just go away so

197
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:24,160
that means that at some points uh uh the

198
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,479
the cable is not legit but yeah uh

199
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,479
this is it is like really difficult

200
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,440
because at some points um these devices

201
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,520
also use the

202
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,039
2.4 gigahertz so at some point you will

203
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,039
have to use

204
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,800
a faraday cage in order to be sure that

205
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,560
the device is communicating or not

206
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,120
because it doesn't use

207
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,039
for example the wi-fi or the bluetooth

208
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,160
protocol at some point you will have to

209
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,039
do some guessing

210
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,840
and so you will have to use a basic rf

211
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,120
explorer

212
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,280
you will see that there will be some

213
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,560
communication but you will be not sure

214
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,080
about that so

215
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,759
at some point you will have also to

216
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,359
isolate the neon

217
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:03,520
and so using a flower decage um

218
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,440
so to identify the other spy there is

219
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,680
like the hard way

220
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,440
so you have to you can tilt down the

221
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,160
device or tear down the cable in order

222
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,199
to be sure

223
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,800
so this is like maybe uh one of the most

224
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,680
particular way to do that but you can

225
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,479
also do that

226
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,840
using rf as i just saw by scanning the

227
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,159
frequency in notifying

228
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,960
an interesting signal then do some

229
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,360
further analysis on it

230
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,359
and when it comes to analyze the signal

231
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,240
uh you can for example determine the

232
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,759
frequency

233
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,519
by determining the frequency you can

234
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,760
maybe classify the signal uh

235
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,640
say that maybe it's like you know wi-fi

236
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,360
bluetooth

237
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,958
lower or something like such by just

238
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,120
looking at the waterfall

239
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:45,199
i mean the shape of the frequency the

240
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,560
modulation etc

241
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,240
and then you can go deeper and then you

242
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,839
can also use some blocks

243
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,959
to process the signal for example using

244
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,200
new radio with sdr for example

245
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,640
and you will have then to decode also

246
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,600
this uh information

247
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,880
using maybe nrz which is really basic or

248
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,240
manchester or

249
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,720
tech or any other encoders etc so

250
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,519
there's like a lot of things to do but

251
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,320
if uh

252
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,560
there's like a any uh shortcuts you can

253
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,800
take for example you can say that okay

254
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,920
this is using bluetooth or easier this

255
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,839
is using wi-fi

256
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,640
you will directly go to this solution in

257
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,240
order to interact with it dump the

258
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,519
communication etc

259
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,519
decode it etc

260
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,519
they're also useful tool when it comes

261
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,760
to reversing some signal like urh

262
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,040
so here for example i was sending a

263
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:39,200
signal

264
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:42,240
with a magic word or a magic work here

265
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,040
uh with a very poor play on ball at the

266
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,560
beginning

267
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:49,360
and this signal uh i can for example

268
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,040
reverse with the viewer tool if i

269
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,279
download for example if i'm lazy

270
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,480
i can use this tool and i will not have

271
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:58,399
for example to use a

272
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,399
ledger companion to process this thing

273
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,440
so this is also a good way for example

274
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:06,240
using simple

275
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:09,519
uh digital coming simple digital

276
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,079
signal like ask psk or fsk

277
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,519
uh use uh is like you know very helpful

278
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:17,199
and you can also decode

279
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,160
all the bits and uh classify them very

280
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,880
easily so

281
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,079
it's really practical using the analysis

282
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,959
tab

283
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,439
but beyond all of that we can also um

284
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,279
trap

285
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:32,720
the devices and then we can analyze them

286
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:35,839
so if for example uh we take the

287
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,440
the example of the microspy bugs at some

288
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,920
point the microspide bugs

289
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,800
use the mobile network and so you can

290
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,760
maybe try

291
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,120
to try to trap them in order to uh i

292
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,760
mean to attract them

293
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,040
to a fake base station in order to see

294
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,959
if there is like a

295
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,880
some malicious things around or not uh

296
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,040
but the problem is that with this

297
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,600
technique is that uh you will probably

298
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,640
also attract the other devices so the

299
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,360
other ue

300
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,800
but if you ask for some people to just

301
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,440
like you know

302
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,120
throw away their phones i mean you know

303
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,680
not bring their phone in the meeting

304
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,760
room

305
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,199
maybe at some point you will maybe have

306
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,120
more chance to drop

307
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,800
these kind of devices in the meeting

308
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,680
room

309
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,839
uh and to drop the device you can use

310
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,319
exactly the same things i was presenting

311
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,320
in a lot of conference about how to trap

312
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,399
for example intel comps etc

313
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,560
so it's exactly the same things you use

314
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,440
the end of a concept in order to

315
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,560
be the strongest bts in order to drop

316
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,680
the device

317
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,359
in your station and

318
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,120
this is the following so for example

319
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,320
here i was using like a blf

320
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,200
and here was the box uh in the in the

321
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,600
right

322
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,320
that was like it's like just a simple

323
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,360
jib uh

324
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,560
g um gprs uh tracker

325
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:58,000
uh and so by just using the appropriate

326
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:00,638
mccm nc that means that i'm using the

327
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,760
uh the exact playman code that is used

328
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,240
by the sim cards

329
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,200
of this device so i can for example try

330
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,160
to brute force this

331
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,200
mccmc in order to find the good one so i

332
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,439
will just

333
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,200
like postpone i mean postpone i will

334
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:17,360
just

335
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,560
broadcast mccmc for each operator and

336
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,680
wait until something

337
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,800
i just got

338
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:28,239
get registered to my device i mean to my

339
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,000
base station i also send a very strong

340
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,200
gsm signal so actually

341
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,720
i'm the strongest i'm the strongest

342
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,720
i'm supposed to be the strongest

343
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:43,519
bts so normally the device here

344
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,279
is supposed to connect to me but uh yeah

345
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,360
in a specific situation where you don't

346
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,360
know where the device is

347
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,959
at some points you will also to use for

348
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,200
example an amplifier

349
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,319
for that and then you can capture the

350
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,760
communication in gpa

351
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,040
gsm or gpas but what if the bug used

352
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,240
like 3g or 4g

353
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,719
if the debug use 3g or 4g there's also a

354
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,240
way

355
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,320
because yeah we know that so there's

356
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,040
like some mutual notification with 3g or

357
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,880
4g

358
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,760
so we can maybe try to downgrade the

359
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,480
communication to gsm by using

360
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,600
some jamming so we can use for example

361
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,320
the jammer like that

362
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,079
or jammer like that or we can also use

363
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,360
like a jammer using sdr

364
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:26,399
which is like a very easy tool to use

365
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,920
i have also released some tools that

366
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,639
allows you for example to map

367
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,839
a lot of gsm base station and then jump

368
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,000
them in order to

369
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,240
for example downgrade the communication

370
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,839
of one specific device to

371
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,240
ubts but

372
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,880
if they are here in the particular case

373
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,079
or

374
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:49,120
when the device

375
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:52,399
for example use only 4g

376
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:55,519
at some point you can also try to

377
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,480
catch only the msi for example here i'm

378
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,079
using like the

379
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:03,839
sslt program and so using

380
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:07,120
slst and using exactly the

381
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:10,160
the right uh mccmc i'm about to

382
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,440
trap one specific device in my base

383
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,160
station

384
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,959
and this device uh just you know i'll

385
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,240
just

386
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:20,719
drop me the imsi but it didn't you know

387
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,279
i didn't complete the registration

388
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,839
because

389
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:29,120
at some point uh i don't have the shared

390
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,079
secret key of the the sim cards in order

391
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,240
to register this

392
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,560
uh this phone but it doesn't matter

393
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,600
because what i wanted to to know is

394
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,839
the uh this is the presence of

395
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,800
any specific device around and so like

396
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,440
that i can maybe

397
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,120
locate any specific device which is

398
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,800
around for example using

399
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:52,560
um my uh my uh i mean

400
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:55,199
your device like that so sorry like that

401
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,839
and i can maybe try to scope any device

402
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,479
around with

403
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,160
for example my blf and see if something

404
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,959
you know get attached or not

405
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,600
so yeah this is not like a nasty things

406
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,959
to do

407
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,440
but uh using sdr uh it is like something

408
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,920
that

409
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,959
it's possible uh you can for example try

410
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,079
to use filepan

411
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:17,599
are a bts that will be put

412
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:19,599
in the location and we try to

413
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,120
broadcast its information in order to

414
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,040
drop as much

415
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:27,680
uh devices on it and then you will

416
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,759
you will try to see what is going on and

417
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:33,439
in 4g you can also do the same but

418
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:36,160
you will just try to to catch the msi

419
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,360
and see if there is like an msi that you

420
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,719
don't know

421
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,880
around they are also in suspected

422
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,440
devices and us-expected devices

423
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,560
are also i mean more difficult to

424
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,720
predict because uh

425
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,439
actually a lot of people use for example

426
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:55,360
uh wireless keyboard wireless mouse etc

427
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,839
and this is a mess and you can find

428
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,600
a lot of devices that can be vulnerable

429
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,320
to keystroke injection like they are on

430
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,480
the mouse

431
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,839
the keyboards the presenters and so on

432
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,440
and the cause of that

433
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,440
is that there's like sometimes no

434
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,120
confidentiality when

435
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,360
you send strokes for example when you

436
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,320
send a stroke or button or

437
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,519
or anything you will see like the stroke

438
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,639
that will be sent

439
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,920
in clear text or anchor that in a way

440
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,920
that you can

441
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,599
use the same code and replay the same

442
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,000
code you can also

443
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,880
replay the same code if for example

444
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,800
there are some devices that

445
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:36,720
protect the keystrokes by just

446
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:40,079
inciting the keystroke but uh there is

447
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,880
no sp i mean there's no iv on the sticky

448
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,880
struck so

449
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,320
you can replay the same key structure

450
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,880
again and again

451
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,360
uh or sometimes the pairing key is sent

452
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,399
clearly

453
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,040
clear so you can just sniff it and then

454
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,440
use it for example to encrypt the the

455
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,680
keystroke etc

456
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,360
and there are like plenty of publication

457
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,279
about this uh like you have like

458
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,880
a lot of tools like marv jack logic

459
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,839
hacker they also

460
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,720
are very good publication by uh uh

461
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,918
matches dick and

462
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,039
uh girl uh klosterner that talk about

463
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,240
some

464
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:16,839
mouses and keyboards how they reverse

465
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,000
the keyboards and mouses so it's pretty

466
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,879
interesting

467
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,679
and here is like you know an example of

468
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,000
using uh

469
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,880
the logitech tool when i was um for

470
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,160
example using

471
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,559
a dongle plugged in the gpd device

472
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,880
and at the right i was just sniffing on

473
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:35,039
the keystrokes and then injecting uh the

474
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,280
keystrokes also myself

475
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,879
after sniffing the pairing and then

476
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,039
using the

477
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,240
the parrot key i was able to inject with

478
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,520
keystrokes uh

479
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:48,559
also uh sniff on the on the keystroke

480
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,879
that will type by the key

481
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:53,120
so the conclusion is that uh wireless

482
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,679
error spy blocks are difficult to track

483
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,399
but still

484
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,679
it's possible you can do that with sdr

485
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,520
or any other mean

486
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:03,760
like that but at some point you will

487
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,160
have to be very strict uh on mapping all

488
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,120
the error device to see if one air

489
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,000
device or one

490
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,399
earth communication is monetary i mean

491
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,520
is

492
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,520
legit or not so

493
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,679
it's really difficult but it's like uh

494
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,879
maybe at some point um it's uh

495
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:23,120
it's um you need uh to uh

496
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,440
maybe have some places that are well

497
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,199
isolated from other devices because

498
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,280
actually it's like you know as you as

499
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,360
you have seen already with that

500
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,480
it's a mess to just like you know stiff

501
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,360
to some specific

502
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,559
communication uh especially when these

503
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,559
devices

504
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,639
and most of the these devices use the

505
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,960
ism bands for that

506
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,960
and a thing that i think that could be

507
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,799
like a very interesting to to work on

508
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,799
is like uh do some further work on

509
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:53,200
identifying the signal using

510
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:56,320
uh some ml i mean machine learning

511
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,720
so thank you for your attention

512
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,000
and if you have any questions please ask

513
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,200
and uh

514
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,360
thank you again so yeah i'm open to all

515
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,840
your questions now

516
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,639
thank you sebastian it's really a great

517
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,840
presentation

518
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,120
so we have one question from the zoom i

519
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,720
said to your knowledge

520
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:19,199
nowadays is a lot of blue teams

521
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,360
so sorry do a lot of blue teams have

522
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,440
some skills with those kind of malicious

523
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,120
devices

524
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,200
i think that uh there are some routines

525
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,000
that have some skills i mean um i have

526
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,880
um already

527
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,720
uh saw a blue team i mean uh there was

528
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,280
like a presentation uh last year about

529
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,360
uh some

530
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,559
implants uh using for example the wheat

531
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,799
injector etc

532
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,918
and some of them also just you know

533
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,320
disassembled some

534
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,559
some of the implants and also notified

535
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:48,080
that there was like some chips etc

536
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:50,080
so yeah actually people uh i mean

537
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,480
i mean i think that blue teams are aware

538
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,439
of this kind of danger uh but

539
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,000
uh generally it comes to uh tearing down

540
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,160
all the

541
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,200
all the cable and you know turned out

542
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,280
all the cables could be

543
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,120
nightmares so you know i i could like

544
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,120
you know be with you know

545
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,039
at my house i could be like only with

546
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,840
wires like a simple wires it's likely a

547
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,000
mess

548
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,280
so i was just exposing how to do that

549
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,919
only with radio

550
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,480
uh you know having maybe some clue on

551
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,640
how to

552
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,600
to test the cable without tearing it

553
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,120
down

554
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,039
so but i think that's how some blue

555
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,000
teams have you know already some some

556
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,600
knowledge about

557
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,720
maybe tearing down the things in order

558
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,360
to see if the things is

559
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,880
malicious or not and um about the other

560
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,080
things about for example this

561
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,039
the spy bugs with the microphone uh this

562
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,360
is something that's uh

563
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,400
already detectives are aware of so uh

564
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,760
generally if you

565
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,200
there's a place that's uh that needs for

566
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,400
example some configuration

567
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,200
confidentiality some

568
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,000
people are just higher uh some some

569
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,960
invader i mean

570
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,720
some people uh in order to uh to for

571
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,240
example do exactly the same thing as i

572
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,400
have presented like a trapping

573
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,760
for example the spine device the spine

574
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,240
mic and then

575
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,400
uh see if there's like um any spine mic

576
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:06,000
around or any anything spawning around

577
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,240
using the mobile network so uh this is

578
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,919
something that maybe uh is like a

579
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,679
knowledge that is a little bit splitted

580
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,600
uh you know around you know all the

581
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,320
profession all the profession because

582
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,520
you have like special detective for that

583
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,840
but

584
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,120
inside the company i don't know i think

585
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,199
that's a

586
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,120
should be i mean it should be uh they

587
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,919
should have some but maybe

588
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,639
not really specializing rf maybe it's

589
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:35,520
like you know more generalists yeah

590
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:38,320
okay so we have another question um

591
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,639
and thank you for your answer um so how

592
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,600
to

593
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,360
ensure a high enough transmission power

594
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,240
and also what kind of

595
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,199
hardware and how far can you be from

596
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,799
your target

597
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:54,880
and last question and is it legal

598
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,879
oh yeah i think the

599
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,559
can you just repeat the questions yeah

600
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,720
sorry lots of questions

601
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:03,039
so how to ensure that you have a high

602
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,480
enough transmission power

603
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:09,520
and what kind of hardware like do you

604
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:12,080
maybe use or targets i don't know and

605
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,360
how far can you be from your target so

606
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,918
it's uh for the

607
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,280
uh for the second i mean the when you

608
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,799
want to trap your device

609
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:22,799
uh so yeah how far depends on how uh

610
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:25,600
how powerful you also transmit uh

611
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:27,679
because everything is uh

612
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,039
it's a relative to the power of the

613
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,200
transmission so

614
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,080
if you want to trap the device uh you

615
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,280
have to be um

616
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:38,399
not too far i mean uh depending on how

617
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:41,440
how much power you also transmit uh and

618
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:44,720
is it leg not uh because actually

619
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,360
uh you cannot transmit uh uh

620
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,159
without having a license for that but

621
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,000
generally

622
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,640
yeah the the thing is that you will not

623
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,400
for example for the the answer of

624
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,840
your question is you will not try to

625
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,520
transmit too much power

626
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,959
in order to not you know annoy for

627
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,039
example the operator

628
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,720
uh by example so you will try to

629
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,440
transmit as less as possible and you

630
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,720
will

631
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,520
try to scan i mean you will try to

632
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,159
target maybe

633
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,120
just the room uh and not uh other rooms

634
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,039
around so

635
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,520
yeah actually this is also a battle with

636
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,840
also other uh bts because uh sometimes

637
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,000
if

638
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,199
you have like a cell which is really

639
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,240
close to your place

640
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,960
you have to to fight against it so this

641
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,039
is also better sometimes so yeah

642
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,559
i mean it requires a lot of time doing

643
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,760
this kind of operation so

644
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,200
generally it's like you know not an

645
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,559
operation that you can do like in a

646
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,880
one-hour shot

647
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,158
i have one question like how how much

648
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,760
does your equipment

649
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:41,840
cost around length uh there it is like

650
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,720
more than a thousand euro because uh you

651
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:47,840
know uh if you spend like a 300 euro

652
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:51,360
for a generic device uh you know it's

653
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:53,279
it doesn't i mean it doesn't i mean

654
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,840
it does worth the price for example for

655
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:58,720
to begin in rf etc to do some generic

656
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,760
uh stuff but uh generally you have to

657
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,520
have like a

658
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,960
for sdr for example for this kind of

659
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,000
purpose if you want to

660
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,000
emulate a base station uh sdr is not a

661
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,640
base station so actually you have to

662
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,520
um to use for example a better clock i

663
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,600
mean a more

664
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,000
a more precise clock for example you

665
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,959
need like also a very good sdr but also

666
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,200
a very good

667
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,320
computer in order to run all of that

668
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,559
because actually

669
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,639
uh the sdr is you know pretty good it's

670
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:27,200
pretty fast but your computer also

671
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,640
has to be very pretty fast so yeah like

672
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,000
also uh

673
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,440
i mean you have to do a lot of

674
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,840
investment uh

675
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,559
so one i think it's going to be the last

676
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,600
question

677
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:43,039
uh is it possible to use a phantom to

678
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,959
emulate a 3g 4g base station and spoof a

679
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:47,200
legit network

680
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,720
you cannot spoof a legit uh network

681
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,640
because actually if you spoof a

682
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,559
legit network you have to to get the

683
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,440
keys and in 3g and 4g

684
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,399
uh you need exactly the uh to have the

685
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,520
keys after you

686
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:02,000
are your register i mean you subscribed

687
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,720
i mean subscriber uh you know in code

688
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,720
because

689
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,559
uh uh there is like some mutual

690
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,840
notification in 3g and 4g

691
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:11,600
unless and for in 3g if someone has a

692
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:15,840
