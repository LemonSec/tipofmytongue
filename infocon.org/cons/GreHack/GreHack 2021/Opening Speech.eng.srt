i'm in junior high or high school and

38
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,159
i've listened to the teachers explaining

39
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,000
for the 15th time how to reduce a

40
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,239
fraction i think i understand it no ms

41
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,760

it does what i want it to

49
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,560

screwed it up

51
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,680

75
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,040
the paceless we've been dominated by

76
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,360
sadists or ignored by the apathetic the

77
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,880
few that had something to teach found us

78
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,720
willing pupils but those few are like

79
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,720
drops of water in the desert

80
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,720
but this is our world now the world is

81
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,479
the electron and switch

82
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,880
the beauty of god we make use of a

83
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,560
service already existing without paying

84
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,080
for what could be dirt cheap if it

85
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,080
wasn't run by profiteering drugs and you

86
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,600
call us criminals

87
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,400
we explore and call us criminals

88
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,479
we seek after knowledge and you call us

89
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,600
criminals

90
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,520

91
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,759
nationality without religious bias and

92
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,680

94
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,440

95
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,800
make us believe that it's for our own

96
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,600

97
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,759

99
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,600
is that of judging people by what they

100
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,360
say and they think not what they look

101

like

102
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,400

something that you'll never forgive me

104
