1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,920
roller on stage

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,799
he is part of the cedric team

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,120
who developed a tool for program and

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,639
malware analysis

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,679
the talk is called gi mimik this is a

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,559
cross-platform recorder and further

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,440
of graphical user interface so events on

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,600
the floor is yours

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,640
thank you

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,720
so yeah i work to see the team i'm a phd

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,320
student at central pelican in riyadh

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,199
and

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,880
i'm presenting you this tool that we can

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,120
search for our purpose and we that we

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,320
want to share

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,280
uh it is a great mimic is a

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,160
fuzzing tool that works by interacting

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,039
with the mouse and keyboard

19
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,840
first of all i need to explain quickly

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,160
why we needed that so

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,360
in our study

22
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,960
we focus on malware analysis this is

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,760
the

24
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,000
malware is just a

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,039
file or

26
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,039
some parts some code inside of a file

27
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,720
that

28
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,880
will execute some malicious actions so

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,720
when it reaches

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,520
a certain target infrastructure

31
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,320
and execute on it

32
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,640
some of the actions

33
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,960
we will study those actions to tell

34
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,759
whether or not it's a malware and more

35
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,880
precisely more interestingly what is the

36
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,600
family which means what are the kind of

37
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,799
actions that it took

38
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,280
more particularly

39
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,840
in our our approach

40
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,600
we want to do what is called dynamic

41
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,640
analysis

42
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,600
which means we want to run those sample

43
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,960
files we want to to analyze

44
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,479
in a controlled environment for example

45
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,720
in the virtual machine

46
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,159
but

47
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,880
we will monitor them as we as they run

48
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,079
and when we think they've executed

49
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,280
their actions

50
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,280
we will retrieve some execution trace

51
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,200
information to whatever that means

52
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,320
resource

53
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,040
performance measurements

54
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,719
system called traces

55
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,759
and

56
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,479
we will perform analysis from these

57
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,959
traces

58
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,480
more precisely we want to have

59
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,879
a machine learning approach which will

60
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,959
give us some requirements

61
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,800
first of all we need to generate a lot a

62
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,360
lot of these execution traces

63
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,080
to be able to train our models

64
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,550
furthermore we want to be able to

65
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,840
[Music]

66
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,040
do some behavioral analysis which means

67
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,599
we for particular softwares

68
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,480
which means we need a lot of traces per

69
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,800
software to understand their their

70
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,360
behavior

71
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,640
that's why we also need some various

72
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,360
data to be sure that

73
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,760
we will explore all the possible

74
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,280
paths to have the

75
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,840
the largest code coverage

76
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,400
of a given software

77
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,560
and finally for our particular need and

78
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,920
some of our models we want to be able to

79
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,319
fuzz some good words

80
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,640
benign software

81
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,920
to learn from

82
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,280
to learn the typical behavior

83
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,640
so

84
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,959
in particular

85
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,640
on most cases the software we want to

86
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,480
fuzz

87
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,400
will not be designed to interact to a

88
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,720
terminal instead they will have a

89
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,879
graphical user interface

90
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,480
and that is what we will interact with

91
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,159
the problem is that

92
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,000
if we want to generate completely random

93
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,040
events

94
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,280
with the mouse and keyboard this is very

95
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,640
ineffective

96
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,840
as we could click for example on the

97
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,760
dead parts of the screen and for example

98
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,120
lose focus on the software you want to

99
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,560
try

100
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,599
so

101
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,799
instead

102
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,439
what we need to do is to create to learn

103
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,280
some rules

104
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,000
for

105
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
the software we actually we're currently

106
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,599
facing

107
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,040
uh telling us what are the active parts

108
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,760
of the interface

109
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,640
so to sum this up

110
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,560
our tool needs to interact through the

111
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,959
graphical user interface

112
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,519
taking on by taking control of the mouse

113
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,440
and the keyboard

114
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,079
uh and generate all uh the necessary

115
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,280
event through that

116
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,720
to learn to make uh coherent actions we

117
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,639
need to record ourselves using the

118
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,000
software

119
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,400
and then we will be able to trim these

120
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,120
sequences this recording

121
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,080
create some rules some logical rules

122
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,520
to make sure

123
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,639
the way we're using the software the way

124
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,800
the fuzzer will use the software is

125
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,479
coherent with its interface

126
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,120
we also need it to be fast because we

127
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,919
want we don't have we should not be

128
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,400
we should not have to spend the days

129
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,199
teaching the software how to use a given

130
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,600
program

131
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,600
but on the other hand we want some

132
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,440
randomization features

133
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,560
as

134
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,600
we need to fuzz it so we should not only

135
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,840
play what we recorded the software needs

136
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,240
to learn more

137
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,680
from the recording learn how to do more

138
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,240
and also we want to be able to target

139
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,560
specific parts of the application

140
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,280
which means for example if we think we

141
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,759
have more to look for

142
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,000
in a certain use case of a software we

143
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,479
need to be able to tell our tool to

144
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,560
focus on this part

145
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,479
and finally ideally this tool would be

146
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,560
cross-platform

147
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,479
to make sure

148
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,520
we are not limited in our studies and

149
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,280
that as many experts can use it

150
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,919
so first of all i'm going to explain to

151
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:52,639
you

152
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,520
how the recording of sequences work uh

153
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,360
when you record yourself using a given

154
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,639
software

155
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,960
i'm going to talk then about how we

156
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,039
represent the actions we are recording

157
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,560
then

158
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,319
i'm going to talk about

159
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,160
the scenarios which are

160
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,199
the way we set the rules

161
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,199
to tell our tool

162
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,160
how to use our target software

163
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,759
then about the editing work you have to

164
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,880
do

165
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,120
you can do to uh

166
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,639
be more accurate in your phrasing

167
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,880
then i'm going to talk about

168
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,840
the events that

169
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,560
we use to simplify your work

170
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,600
and how the software the system will

171
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,199
interpret them

172
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,960
and then about some transformations that

173
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,319
are made

174
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,600
to ease your work and to add some more

175
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,840
fuzzing

176
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,039
capabilities so first of all about the

177
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,240
recording of sequences it is very simple

178
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,319
with the software you just have

179
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,479
either to press a button or to press a

180
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,280
short key by default by default both

181
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,720
control keys quite unusual

182
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,639
to start or stop recording

183
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,639
from that you will get a sequence of

184
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,000
events which is all that the system send

185
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,039
us

186
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,759
all the events the system generated from

187
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,240
the data collected from the mouse and

188
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,440
keyboard

189
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,919
each of these events has its own

190
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,039
information like the duration of

191
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,560
the time to wait before the event

192
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,599
executes

193
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,520
for keyboard events the key that are

194
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,360
used for mouse events sometimes the

195
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,199
coordinates sometimes the button used

196
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,880
when it's a click

197
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,319
and the scroll amount

198
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,440
so now

199
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,400
i'm going to show you

200
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,879
how the recording works

201
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,080
so here i'm just starting the software

202
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,720
so here in this and in this case i'm

203
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,199
trying to first visual studio

204
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,440
so what i'm gonna do is first record

205
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,400
myself uh starting the application

206
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,479
so for that i just type in a name

207
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,479
for the sequence to generate

208
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,000
and then i start the recording

209
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:12,120
so i'll choose to start it this way

210
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,759
and once uh once the system is start the

211
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,080
the visual studio code is started i just

212
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,840
press both control keys to stop the

213
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,960
recording

214
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,199
from that uh we've retrieved

215
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,199
a comp the sequence of everything that

216
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,400
happened

217
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,599
now i'm just saving the file

218
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:32,880
and

219
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,479
to

220
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,360
have a better code coverage

221
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,279
you should record yourself

222
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,640
doing this

223
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,959
in multiple different ways so here

224
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,200
i'm going to record myself again

225
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,080
starting it in another way

226
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,279
this is

227
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,040
to ensure that

228
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,200
some sort of some malware for example

229
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,080
might trigger on different conditions

230
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,320
by uh starting uh the software in

231
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,560
different conditions in different ways i

232
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,518
may reach those different conditions

233
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,800
now i'm going to show you

234
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,120
what is the content of

235
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,600
a given sequence

236
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,320
so here i've recorded a few sequence and

237
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,399
uh here i'm loading

238
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,560
a long sequence of

239
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,040
uh a complete use of the software

240
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,200
so this takes some time to load

241
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,519
but as you can see many

242
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,320
many different events mostly mouse moves

243
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,800
which are infinitesimal

244
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,480
mouse movements

245
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,560
and this sequence

246
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,000
holds

247
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,880
everything that happens when uh

248
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,760
we use the software

249
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,440
um from that

250
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,640
you've seen that there were

251
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,200
many different events and a lot of

252
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,560
events that

253
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,959
were quite the same

254
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,320
so

255
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,959
we created two classes two types of

256
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,640
events

257
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,480
let's say for example we want to model a

258
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,560
simple mouse move which means

259
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,880
a simple mouse click which means we want

260
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,320
to move the mouse to a certain place on

261
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,920
the screen

262
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,279
then press

263
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,160
a button this is from the system what we

264
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,440
get is a very long sequence of mouse

265
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,480
moves

266
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,040
like moving from two pixels uh

267
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,440
pixels back almost pixel back pixel by

268
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,800
pixel

269
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,240
then i must press

270
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,640
and i must release on the same button

271
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,760
uh so

272
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,839
all of these little events are atomic

273
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,880
events

274
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,120
we cannot split them and this is

275
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,720
concretely the information we gather

276
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,720
from the system

277
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,880
on the other hand we decided to

278
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,800
uh modelize that

279
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,279
with what we call a synthetic event

280
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,959
this is just a merged representation of

281
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,800
all these atomic events

282
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,200
and when we want to play it

283
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,720
to make sure the system understands we

284
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,200
need to develop it back into a sequence

285
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,560
of atomic events

286
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,360
without this has two advantages first of

287
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,560
all it's much easier for us to

288
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,839
manipulate

289
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,399
and second

290
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,000
getting rid of some of the exact the

291
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,480
exact information of the mouse paths

292
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,920
allows us

293
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,640
to

294
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,040
add some variability

295
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,160
so for example if we look at the

296
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,240
sequence we recorded earlier we could

297
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,880
synthesize it by grouping the the key

298
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,800
that we used to type

299
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,240
and the mouse moves

300
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,560
so here i'm going to show you

301
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,880
how to uh

302
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,720
what the synthetic events look like look

303
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,959
like

304
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,279
so here i'm just creating an empty

305
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,440
sequence and

306
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,360
instead of making all the events one by

307
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,680
one i'm going to create

308
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,519
just synthetic events

309
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,040
that will represent

310
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,959
complex sequences but

311
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,720
just in a few events so here for example

312
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,880
i add a mouse click so it means going to

313
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,760
click

314
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,480
on

315
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,800
some specific place on the screen

316
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,399
with sometimes there might be multiple

317
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,279
clicks

318
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,600
i can precise the duration

319
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,079
and coordinate some even

320
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,959
i can set random coordinates

321
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,760
and also

322
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,760
set

323
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,800
the mouse button to use

324
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,440
so this is this this event is added to

325
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,240
the sequence i'm going also to add

326
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,079
another event uh

327
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,000
so keyboard inputs means typing some

328
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,240
text

329
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,200
so i have to type in the duration

330
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,680
before starting to type

331
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,720
and

332
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,680
then

333
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,680
what i want to type you could type for

334
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,079
example a certain specific text but it's

335
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,240
not extremely useful for phrasing or

336
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,600
except in some specific cases

337
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,200
on the other hand you could also add

338
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,600
some random words to appear

339
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,720
like

340
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,320
the goal is to

341
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,240
make it look like a real user

342
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,839
so ideally some random english words

343
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,480
i can also precise the typing speed and

344
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,200
now the sequence is ready

345
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,760
to be played

346
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,240
now that let's suppose we made enough

347
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,519
sequences

348
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,959
uh we've recorded enough data to play

349
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,800
we want to make scenarios which are

350
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,800
a set of rules to tell the system how to

351
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,040
use the sequences so for example

352
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,720
let's say you've made a recipe book for

353
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,279
a given application

354
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,600
this means a lot of sequences

355
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,199
of different use cases

356
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,880
ideally you would not record yourself

357
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,920
using the entire software at once as you

358
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,040
would have

359
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,720
this would not be a good material to

360
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,639
explain how to use the software instead

361
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,839
you

362
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,279
record yourself

363
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,639
using

364
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,120
specific steps of the software

365
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,959
so for example i have multiple starting

366
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,360
sequence ways to start the application

367
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,880
multiple

368
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,399
creating new files sequences and so on

369
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,560
so now to explain how

370
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,480
to explain our tool how to use the

371
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,000
sequences

372
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,720
uh we will make a scenario which is just

373
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,760
a set of a sequence of regular

374
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,800
expressions

375
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,360
which uh will tell him

376
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,360
which will tell it how to

377
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,399
choose the

378
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,199
in between the sequences to make a valid

379
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,519
scenario so for example

380
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,720
uh

381
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,839
i'd say

382
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:50,720
save

383
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,240
dot star means

384
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,120
uh

385
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,040
i want you to choose a sequence which

386
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,839
names begins with

387
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,360
save and then at the moment playing the

388
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,079
scenario the system will choose one

389
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,000
sequence per expression and play them in

390
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,199
the exact same order

391
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,160
so here for example

392
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,160
i will make one of these scenarios

393
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,959
so to do that i just have to insert the

394
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,518
expressions

395
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,519
so for example the first thing to do of

396
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,000
course is to start with your studio code

397
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,480
in any possible way possible so

398
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,440
i will

399
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,560
name it

400
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,399
start dot

401
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,639
dot star

402
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:39,600
dot

403
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,759
it says the language of python regular

404
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,199
expressions

405
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,519
so dot star means any character any

406
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,160
number of times

407
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,360
so

408
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,360
i'll just have to add a few sequences

409
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,759
for example a few

410
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,279
expressions

411
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,040
as you do this you will be able to see

412
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,079
all the possible outcomes

413
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,560
for example a valid use case for visual

414
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,880
studio code would be well first to start

415
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,320
the application

416
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,959
then create a new file

417
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,360
here in this particular case as you can

418
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,079
see

419
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,600
i've already i've only made one sequence

420
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,839
name new file so i don't need to put the

421
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,399
dot star

422
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,519
then

423
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,440
code something

424
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,560
and at the end exit

425
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,880
so on the software you will on the tool

426
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,839
you will have

427
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,160
many information here you could see

428
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,279
the all the possible choices that

429
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,480
would

430
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,480
come out of this scenario

431
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,880
you can have also all the the outcomes

432
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,680
or

433
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,199
only for a specific expression

434
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,000
and once this is done

435
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,839
i'm able to play the scenario

436
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,559
and now

437
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,679
just a bit

438
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:06,880
i'm going to talk a bit about the

439
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,599
editing work you can do to

440
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,438
improve your sequences

441
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,319
first of all let's say you have recorded

442
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,839
some things but you want to add more

443
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,079
sequences

444
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,760
the first thing you want to you can do

445
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,000
is just to add as i've shown earlier

446
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,839
your own events

447
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,400
ideally synthetic events because they

448
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,679
are much much easier to handle

449
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,520
and once this is done you can apply

450
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,799
transformations

451
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,520
transformations can be applied instantly

452
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,360
to ease your work

453
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,440
let's say you want to the whole sequence

454
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,480
to last twice as long you might you

455
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,400
might not want to edit each event

456
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,720
individually to do that instead you can

457
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,400
apply transformations

458
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,120
to

459
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,480
change all the events at once

460
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,400
once this is done at the amount of

461
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,440
playback

462
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,679
two steps will be done

463
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,520
first of all all the synthetic events

464
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,320
that you use to easily manipulate and

465
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,799
easily understand the sequences

466
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,400
will have to be developed back into

467
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,640
atomic events as this is what the system

468
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,480
expects

469
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,640
and once this is done we can apply some

470
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,280
other transformations that we will we

471
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,280
will have scheduled

472
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,760
uh ideally those transformations are

473
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,080
random transformations the idea is that

474
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,160
each time you will play them

475
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,600
the corresponding sequences you will

476
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,719
have a different outcome

477
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,440
so here for example i'm going to show

478
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,120
you what a playback looks like

479
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,080
so here i'm playing the scenario that we

480
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,559
made earlier

481
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,240
here it's important to note that i'm not

482
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,679
touching the keyboard and the mouse

483
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,200
so here

484
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,280
the scenario if you remember contain the

485
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,080
expression start a new file which also

486
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,440
include i think saving a file and a

487
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,679
code and exit

488
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,919
so here it will choose one sequence

489
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,039
corresponding to each case

490
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,640
so here it will

491
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,600
i think we'll save something

492
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,919
yeah it will save the file

493
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,960
and then code something and then exit

494
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,280
as for uh maybe you want to know about

495
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,559
the complexity this tool is uh quite

496
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,000
lightweight

497
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,039
you won't have any

498
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,200
complex operations all the operations

499
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,880
are on sequences

500
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,640
of

501
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,640
relatively small sizes

502
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,919
so

503
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,320
we've made it so all the operations at

504
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,679
worst linear

505
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,720
both in space and time

506
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,799
so

507
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:43,600
um

508
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,000
finish typing here it tries to run the

509
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,880
code

510
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,320
and once this is done it should exceed

511
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,399
the application

512
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,919
and once this is done you will collect

513
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,760
the exact sequence of event that was

514
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,880
played

515
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,880
to be able to replay it

516
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,799
if you want to repeat the experiment

517
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,520
now i'm going to talk a bit about these

518
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,919
synthetic events as this is not

519
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,919
this these are some opportunities

520
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,640
developing them over some opportunities

521
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,080
first of all about the mouse click

522
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,520
events when you go to click on certain

523
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,240
position on the mouse

524
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,400
they develop back into the way they were

525
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,559
before which means

526
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,960
a sequence of mouse moves infinitive

527
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,720
infinitesimal moves

528
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,559
then a mouse person must release as many

529
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,320
times as needed if you want to do double

530
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,640
click or more

531
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,840
but

532
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,080
the path is not saved in the event in

533
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,520
the synthetic event

534
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,400
so we have to create it and this is a

535
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,159
good phasing opportunity

536
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,200
what we do is choose a random point

537
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,799
on a discus

538
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,559
centered in the middle of the starting

539
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,799
point and the ending point

540
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,600
and make a busy curve

541
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,280
from the strip a degree to basically

542
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,200
from those three points and this will be

543
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,600
our most path

544
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,960
on the other hand

545
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,600
four keyboard inputs

546
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,240
we have you can type in

547
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,640
any kind of text your keyboard can type

548
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,679
um

549
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,000
for that we have to handle

550
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,200
uh many corner cases

551
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,080
uppercase cases are

552
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,880
quite

553
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,679
simple to handle much harder for special

554
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,919
character cases

555
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,640
and this will develop into a sequence of

556
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,480
key presses and releases ordered in

557
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,760
right order

558
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,840
to make to type the the text you wanted

559
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,080
it to type

560
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,360
now i'm going to talk a bit more about

561
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,600
the transforms

562
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,559
so

563
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,880
the transformations are

564
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,840
just functions that take on an event and

565
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,640
returns zero or more events

566
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,880
the idea is to

567
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,200
apply this you define this function

568
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,240
or you take

569
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,240
already an already made transform

570
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,679
and this will transform an entire

571
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,280
sequence

572
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,480
so

573
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,080
the transformation can be applied as i

574
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,080
said a few times

575
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,960
either at editing

576
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,960
to ease your work

577
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,080
so i do the example of

578
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,400
lengthening the the duration

579
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,280
of

580
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,679
your sequence

581
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,520
there are much more you can also that's

582
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,200
why the time dilation you can also

583
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,720
filter some events for example let's say

584
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,080
you don't want

585
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,559
any keyboard press on a certain key

586
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,000
i don't know because you don't have the

587
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,640
key for example

588
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,760
uh and on the other hand

589
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,159
you can also apply a sequence at right

590
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:48,960
time

591
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,080
so the idea is that this is

592
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,720
much more useful to do that for random

593
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,960
random transformations

594
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,840
uh

595
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,480
for example the time noise uh it's very

596
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,120
useful in the case of a keyboard input

597
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,679
when you develop a keyboard input event

598
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,320
into a sequence of mouse keyboard press

599
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,480
and keyboard releases

600
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,559
the corresponding sequence will have all

601
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,799
the events will have the same duration

602
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,600
which is quite not human-like

603
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,840
so instead you can schedule a time-nose

604
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,600
transform which will add some noise on

605
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,360
the timestamps

606
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,559
to make them a bit random

607
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:29,280
and

608
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,280
since this is applied at runtime every

609
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,640
time you play the sequence you will have

610
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,919
a different outcome

611
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,679
you can also for example randomize

612
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,520
slightly the mouse moves to make sure

613
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,440
you don't click at the same time exactly

614
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,080
at the same place

615
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,400
so here i'm going to show you uh how to

616
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,799
make those transforms

617
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,840
so here i've opened it's the sequence

618
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,000
that we defined earlier i'm going to

619
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,279
first of all

620
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,520
uh

621
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,039
apply um

622
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,440
time dilation transformation

623
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,159
so

624
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,840
the only thing i need is the dilation

625
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,080
factor but here i don't really need it

626
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,440
because we made a synthetic synthetic

627
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,080
event sequence that's very useful

628
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,240
on the other hand uh applying a time

629
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,320
nose is always useful especially when

630
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,279
there is

631
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,120
a keyboard input events

632
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,000
which is here

633
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,159
and this is done when we will play the

634
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:25,360
sequence

635
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,039
this transformation will be applied and

636
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:31,960
add some random noise and the execution

637
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,600
so to conclude we made this tool

638
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,559
to

639
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,360
mimic the interactions with a given

640
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,400
software of a normal user

641
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,799
it can generate most of these

642
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,760
kind of interactions

643
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,000
the

644
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,679
our representation in sequences

645
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,600
scenarios

646
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,440
ensures that all the interaction it will

647
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,480
generate

648
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,240
are coherent with the interface of the

649
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,159
software

650
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:05,760
to make sure we don't lose control and

651
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,559
we

652
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:07,520
keep

653
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,520
fuzzing the software as we want

654
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,279
it is quite

655
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,880
fast we've

656
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,200
here i had only i had to do

657
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,120
less than 10 recordings and i was able

658
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,159
to

659
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,120
run

660
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,240
some

661
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,320
fast some

662
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,200
simple fuzzing

663
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,600
the scenarios the synthetic events and

664
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,039
transformations

665
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,240
uh

666
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,440
are all made to and to offer you good

667
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,440
fuzzing capabilities

668
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,360
to make sure to increase the code from

669
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,400
coverage

670
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
of the software you're testing

671
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,760
above what you've recorded

672
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,320
the scenarios are what allows you to

673
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,320
target specific parts

674
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,520
if you record

675
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,440
sequences using specific part of the

676
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,600
software you just have to

677
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,000
incorporate more scenarios using

678
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,840
these sequences or to make sure let's

679
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,360
say you use these sequences the most

680
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,279
and we've tested it on multiple

681
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,360
environments on multiple for example

682
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,039
linux distributions

683
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,000
and

684
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,440
it works

685
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,799
on those platforms

686
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,400
and you can download this tool it's

687
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,559
available on this

688
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,320
git repository

689
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,480
so thank you for listening and uh

690
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,680
complete your questions

691
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:34,880
[Applause]

692
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,080
thank you thank you very much for for

693
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,400
the talk uh do do we have questions in

694
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,799
the room

695
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,679
uh maybe maybe a first question from uh

696
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,840
from my side uh

697
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,640
did you implement strategies to measure

698
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,240
and optimize the coverage

699
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,840
so this tool is uh blind to the software

700
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,840
it's testing which means

701
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,960
it doesn't know what it's really doing

702
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,080
so we don't have tools to to say to

703
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,240
measure the coverage like the actual

704
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,279
coverage

705
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,720
uh

706
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,360
your you can only do that to making sure

707
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,120
your scenarios in

708
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,760
your editing and scenarios may

709
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,679
have a good coverage

710
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,399
okay thank you

711
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,279
thank you very much for the presentation

712
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,760
my question is so the idea is to do some

713
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,679
fuzzing so

714
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,000
ideally you would need an example where

715
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,640
you're able to crash a program

716
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,480
and you would be able to reproduce the

717
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,559
crash consistently based on your

718
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,640
parameters so that's the first question

719
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,279
did you do do you have an example of

720
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,000
such a crash and the second question is

721
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,480
what is the granularity of the time

722
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,840
of the time events that you're doing

723
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,960
because uh

724
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,159
if you have

725
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,399
if you your crash is based on on the

726
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,559
race condition uh you need to be able to

727
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,159
control the the parameters very

728
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,520
precisely

729
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,480
so

730
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,159
we didn't do this for uh

731
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,559
debugging for debugging software uh

732
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,799
instead we do this from our analysis our

733
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,880
goal is to trigger malwares sometimes

734
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,159
viruses that that hide into some

735
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,760
software

736
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,200
so uh no we don't have example of uh

737
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,279
generating crashes but did you trigger

738
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,799
the the malware's considered

739
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,919
consistently and we uh mostly focus on

740
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,120
goodwill for for now

741
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,760
because we wanted to generate to measure

742
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,200
the um

743
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,960
what is the normal behavior

744
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,760
for

745
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,559
um ai models

746
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:39,360
and

747
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,600
about the time precision

748
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,919
uh i've tested it i've run multiple

749
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:44,880
tests

750
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,720
on different sequences

751
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,000
we have

752
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,480
we are at the system accuracy

753
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,039
which means that

754
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,520
for example even at very long sequences

755
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,799
we can reach

756
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,880
the time precision on the order of a

757
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,799
nanosecond okay

758
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,120
thank you

759
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,520
thank you

760
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:10,200
any other question in the room

761
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,240
maybe uh one last one for for me um

762
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,559
but i guess i i have already the answer

763
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,960
but do you have strategy to minimize

764
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,520
your data set but as you mentioned as

765
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,440
you don't know what's going on in the

766
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,480
program

767
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,880
the data set the vector that you input

768
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,520
on your on your further

769
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,320
uh

770
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,039
what do you mean to minimize

771
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,720
the number of the recording you mean

772
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,559
yeah number of recording number of the

773
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,200
data number of vectors that you input in

774
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,960
your in your feather

775
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,120
uh well

776
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,600
minimizing is done mainly by the

777
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,399
sentences of events

778
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,240
on the other hand you should not try to

779
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,399
minimize it to make sure to increase

780
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,080
your code coverage the more recordings

781
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,399
you do the more you'll be uh

782
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,240
the better the code coverage

783
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,440
uh

784
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,880
yeah but on the other hand for a given

785
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,120
coverage you would like to minimize the

786
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,760
data input but as you can you cannot

787
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,159
measure the the coverage yeah on the

788
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,240
other hand it is a trade-off of all the

789
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,840
recording you will do and the

790
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,080
transformation you will be able to apply

791
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,080
uh the randomness

792
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,640
in built-in in the events you will

793
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,880
manually add

794
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,720
so yeah it is just a trade-off because

795
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,039
between all those things

796
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,520
okay thank you very much i guess we can

797
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,039
thank you again vance for the

798
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,039
presentation
