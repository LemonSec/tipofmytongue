1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:09,999
the evil hid devices thank you good

2
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:13,719
afternoon everyone so today we're

3
00:00:09,999 --> 00:00:15,759
talking about malicious hid devices we

4
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:19,630
will do a short introduction about where

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:22,210
it is first we are we are blue team al4

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:25,240
Frank and I'm Aaron Timur at Societe

7
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:29,169
Generale so we are doing a defensive or

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:32,259
offensive security things you have some

9
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:35,410
example the agenda for today so first a

10
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:38,140
shot into election about hid devices why

11
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:41,110
is it interesting some attacker

12
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:46,030
perspectives so what can we do with hid

13
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:47,859
devices and front will do some forensics

14
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:51,280
or system forensic and hardware

15
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:54,609
forensics and some devices we have chose

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:01:00,820
on the 2ds this year and to finish some

17
00:00:54,609 --> 00:01:05,049
take away okay so little introduction

18
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:08,850
with some definition in context so HID

19
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:12,340
stands for human interface devices

20
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:15,189
basically it's a keyboard mouse drastic

21
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:23,439
anything we can use to send input to a

22
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:27,809
machine almost six years ago a toolbox

23
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:30,729
of the NSA and they compress and we

24
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:36,790
discover all that they use from almost

25
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:40,630
ten ten years HIV implant called Martin

26
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:45,780
cottonmouth this distinct tongue and bed

27
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:48,548
two modules with microcontrollers for

28
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:52,990
some air

29
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:57,549
Raja frequencies Indian this employee

30
00:01:52,990 --> 00:02:03,759
cost at this time almost 20,000 bucks

31
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:09,940
and ten years later as of today the

32
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:12,670
device as per mode Shapiro last month we

33
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:17,829
saw as far as I know the first

34
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:25,000
implant used in the wire on the ATM and

35
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:28,540
it should be as USB devices I used to do

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,790
a team reporting attack so the main goal

37
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:34,510
of this kind of attack is to spit out

38
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:37,780
all the cash from the ATM the attackers

39
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:42,220
need to access physically to the team

40
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:46,690
and then they plug through the USB port

41
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:52,360
a module and this attack this was a

42
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:55,270
raspberry and punky one fat from it show

43
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:58,300
itself as a keyboard to send keystroke

44
00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:04,060
to executive portion script to starts a

45
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:06,790
final period okay so let me introduce

46
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:10,300
some toys we have played with so I think

47
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,679
you all known the rubber duckie it salts

48
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:19,000
is since toast

49
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:21,070
2010 each chip 45 bucks it's for okay so

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,630
the front factor is a simple USB keys

51
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:26,109
where you plugged it the payload is

52
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:28,540
launched its exact route and simulate so

53
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:32,650
a key stretch the payload is stored on

54
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:37,540
the on SD card so basically it's simple

55
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:39,430
to add new pillared but it's very very

56
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:42,489
limited so you plugged it the payload is

57
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:46,270
launched and it's over so we are

58
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:47,980
interested in the with injector with

59
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:51,570
injector is far more interesting because

60
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:55,869
there is multiple connectivity options

61
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:58,320
USB but also Wi-Fi so the attackers can

62
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:01,390
connect over Wi-Fi to the board and

63
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:06,640
execute commands so basically sun-kissed

64
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:07,450
work through board and it cuts it can

65
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,059
simulate

66
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:13,000
serial port so you can communicate UCR

67
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:15,430
with the board and for the future

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,048
versions there will be a GSM option so

69
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,519
you can communicate with the board so

70
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:22,190
GSM network so it could be very

71
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:25,640
interesting because you have a very wild

72
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:29,260
at a crunch so for that way

73
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:35,090
it's a at niggas sorry to and the

74
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:38,270
esp8266 for the connectivity part if you

75
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:41,869
want to add P load so it's just at

76
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:43,460
window base or you compile the zoomin

77
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:46,010
program and you can use a small web

78
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:48,739
interface to store the payload pillow it

79
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:53,000
all stored on the board using spy ffs

80
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:56,090
filesystem so it's just right on the

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,560
chip and so you can launch the payload

82
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:02,179
when you plug the board or via Wi-Fi so

83
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,360
it's very interesting

84
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:07,430
by default it presents as a USB key but

85
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,510
if you have some soldering skills you

86
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:15,440
can just enter the USB part and I'd eat

87
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:18,170
in the mouse for example so this one is

88
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:21,200
very interesting and we have still its

89
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:26,060
three options on this one is the one

90
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:27,680
with the most possibility and to finish

91
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:34,640
who has been injured so he has been in

92
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:38,510
JA is assault since 2018 there is some

93
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:40,190
connectivity so USB classical but also

94
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:43,909
bluetooth but only to trigger the

95
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:46,760
pillared so it's a one-way Bluetooth

96
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:52,340
communication only between a remote and

97
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:57,200
the ball first Yahoo ad so I 80 teeny 85

98
00:05:52,340 --> 00:06:00,489
and the Bluetooth module and to start

99
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:03,440
payload you have to recompile the wall

100
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:05,330
the word program and upload it on the

101
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,980
board so it could be a little

102
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:11,359
complicated if you want to change your

103
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:16,940
payload on the fly and it's very very

104
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:18,919
expensive $180 for the cable why it's

105
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,290
the visual aspect is very interesting

106
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:24,010
because there is cables or lightning

107
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:27,310
cable USBC cable etcetera

108
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:29,890
that's cool but it's very too expensive

109
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:36,130
for the limited capabilities of this

110
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:39,669
device new device are no existing so

111
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:41,830
this week two new device appears so the

112
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:43,840
we delete act arced about it it's so

113
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:47,289
basically an improvement of the with

114
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:50,619
injector with a GSM module and a new

115
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:52,330
cable called a Velcro cable so from

116
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:57,160
factor is interesting we would like to

117
00:06:52,330 --> 00:07:01,780
study this this hardware so I will let

118
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:03,610
fracture reasons still my pad so first

119
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:07,330
attacker perspectives what can we do

120
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:10,720
with this kind of hardware if some of

121
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:16,060
you have seen mr. robot in the season

122
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:18,400
one darlin drops some USB key unpacking

123
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:20,440
and up that someone will pick the key

124
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:24,250
and plug it on the computer inside

125
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:27,390
present this technique is used mainly by

126
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:31,420
red teamer as far as I know maybe by

127
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:33,340
attacker group the payload is a little

128
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:35,680
small but the payload executed air is

129
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:41,349
just a simple powerful delivery so you

130
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:44,890
grab a full peripheral script online and

131
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:48,250
executive directly this can be detected

132
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:50,770
by antivirus I'm syan windows so there

133
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:53,890
is other option you can use a lot bins

134
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:57,099
so executive file already present on the

135
00:07:53,890 --> 00:08:00,130
system such as sagittal to decode or

136
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:02,410
download files bits admin at cetera all

137
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:04,840
you can also drop the file embed

138
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:06,460
directly in your PowerShell pedal so you

139
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,950
are limited by the size of the ball I

140
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:11,820
think it's to make a maximum for the

141
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:13,349
payload but you could do something

142
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:16,750
[Music]

143
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:19,210
another option only with with cactus

144
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:22,570
with the change injector is to use the

145
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:24,580
serial port to exfiltrate data so on

146
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:28,780
Windows 10 on a limb Windows 10 for the

147
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:30,760
Windows padlet for Linux is the same the

148
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,949
serial port is automatically created and

149
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:36,069
mounted so you can talk with it directly

150
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:38,829
using PowerShell so this is a

151
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:40,449
pretty crappy payload the idea is just

152
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:43,319
to read the file you want to a still

153
00:08:40,448 --> 00:08:46,209
trade so you have to know it before you

154
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,040
anchored it in bath 64 cause if it's a

155
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:52,239
binary data you will probably brick

156
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:54,370
break your Cyril connection and you try

157
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,079
to iterate through all available con

158
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:59,440
parts and you write your payload on each

159
00:08:56,079 --> 00:09:01,029
part so it works pretty well so your

160
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,720
payload is taught on the board no you

161
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:07,660
have to get back this payload exfiltrate

162
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,000
data is taught on the board so you have

163
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:13,449
to be able to connect on the board to

164
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,829
get your payload so you have multiple

165
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:21,550
options as I say with with cactus

166
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:23,290
proposed a Wi-Fi option communication so

167
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:25,810
you can create an access point connect

168
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:28,860
on it and through the web interface get

169
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:32,800
your fight fine it works well it's good

170
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:35,019
if the round is a longer maybe you can

171
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,750
just tell the wheel injector to connect

172
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:39,250
on a public Wi-Fi and you connect also

173
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:42,540
on the public Wi-Fi you go to the web

174
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:46,269
interface and you can get get your files

175
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:50,920
it's so you want a bigger branch you can

176
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:52,720
use with elite and use a GSM network to

177
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,719
connect on the web interface and get

178
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,389
your file and if you don't have access

179
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:01,420
at all you will probably have to break

180
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:04,149
into enterprise or pay someone to get

181
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:06,399
you your malicious device back to you

182
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:08,620
so this is an option if it made this

183
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:12,910
kind of attack is real so could be

184
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:18,130
interesting now the nice part

185
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:19,870
so I'll start ways analyzed you can have

186
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:22,569
an alert through you the technique

187
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:26,439
prevention system an area through you

188
00:10:22,569 --> 00:10:29,589
see em when it works or you have a user

189
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:32,199
coming to you saying that there is a

190
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:36,279
suspicious behavior on this computer and

191
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:40,060
then used out your forensic job so this

192
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:42,550
is not come about for forensics so I

193
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:45,910
will not stay longer on this kind of

194
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:47,810
analysis but basically you grab your

195
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:50,300
user computer you

196
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:54,138
them the computer and analysis don't you

197
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:56,449
dump you extract some indicators and the

198
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:59,930
feed that you were with your threat and

199
00:10:56,449 --> 00:11:05,389
ting team and gather reality device and

200
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:11,388
you repeat this process on Windows there

201
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:15,110
is a lot of you for useful artifacts for

202
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:20,990
my sign I like to do some timeline to

203
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:25,160
see really all the action that succeed

204
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:30,709
to do it each other and when you see

205
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:36,889
this kind of of trace this is not good

206
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:41,420
at all when you see three different USB

207
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:46,059
devices in the exact millisecond appear

208
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:50,019
in Newton line you can you can doubt the

209
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:54,740
sociologists upon on the computer

210
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:59,660
another good indicators is the Windows

211
00:11:54,740 --> 00:12:02,660
Event log in your case there is some

212
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:05,469
some of them that were useful you have

213
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:09,980
the basic one like PowerShell and

214
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:15,189
freaking play device but the wrong were

215
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:18,800
really useful first at the event ID 225

216
00:12:15,189 --> 00:12:20,540
it's means you use will be devices

217
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,870
cannot be removed because it currently

218
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:26,569
used okay

219
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:31,120
in your case the event log shows that

220
00:12:26,569 --> 00:12:34,550
it's partial the choose USB devices and

221
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:38,600
you SDGs is it seemed to be a keyboard

222
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:41,569
mouse and this is not good at all but

223
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:46,189
it's a side effect and it could be

224
00:12:41,569 --> 00:12:50,259
really interesting so your continue to

225
00:12:46,189 --> 00:12:54,399
analyse your timeline and you show this

226
00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:59,000
another event ID rated to portion and

227
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:00,810
you can say anything base64-encoded

228
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:07,020
you decorate

229
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:12,000
and you see this kind of pillowed so you

230
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:14,939
know that attackers target a specific

231
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:22,620
file you have some eye you see to

232
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:25,860
extract for the USB ninja for whatever

233
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:30,180
reason on test computer that I'll tilt

234
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:32,730
of targeted the reversal database has

235
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:36,739
not been synchronized correctly when we

236
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:40,410
shut down the computer so when we Eliza

237
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:46,700
the timeline we didn't see social issues

238
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:50,969
keyboard like USB device that pop up and

239
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:56,730
the only source of interesting events

240
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:59,400
was an event ID the 112 and you can see

241
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:01,970
you have the data or the name in the

242
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:09,480
property and you can see the kind of

243
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:14,580
very suspicious devices so we really

244
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:17,550
have do not trust only one tool and in

245
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:21,770
no case we check with another tool and

246
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:26,130
this tour told us that the river 3 is

247
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:27,750
appeared to be dirty so we use possum

248
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:29,810
chill dog you know the log with a big

249
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:34,620
log at the end

250
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:39,060
besides the registry and when we mix

251
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:44,100
them and we load them USB v ID a PID

252
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:48,510
appears in the HED side and so we can

253
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:51,600
continue your analysis you check the ID

254
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:55,530
PID you make a research on the internet

255
00:14:51,600 --> 00:15:01,170
and really it does not appear to be a

256
00:14:55,530 --> 00:15:03,959
simple keyboard so at this time so far

257
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:08,040
you know that USB device was used to

258
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:12,630
launch a portion period if you has a

259
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:16,400
chance to wrap the devices now you can

260
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:16,400
under it and analyze it

261
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:23,529
first thing first do not connect the USB

262
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,380
device on the computer okay

263
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:30,640
even the best of the best of the best

264
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:32,860
can fill and in the strap and yes I can

265
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:36,579
hear some of you say blah blah blah yeah

266
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:39,550
very nice I don't give a all USB

267
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:42,459
devices really give zero about

268
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:46,300
about your eyes and this kind of device

269
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:51,880
will blow up your computer the USB

270
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:54,189
killer send almost 200 volts through a

271
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:58,810
USB port and flies up your mother

272
00:15:54,190 --> 00:16:00,550
brought the proof-of-concept surf

273
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:04,180
district mr. Cerf district from Mike

274
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:11,160
rubber at the best will explode or

275
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:14,979
really some nice gases so this is a good

276
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:21,689
attention to not connect directly on

277
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:24,790
your computer so the basic process 12

278
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:28,240
external inspections and internal

279
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:31,630
inspection try to make a component

280
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:34,000
identification and try to play with

281
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:40,510
adware to them the data and try to

282
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:42,579
analysis the dank okay so for the

283
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:44,680
robotic age is pretty easy

284
00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:46,739
even without every skills in other

285
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:49,540
foreign sick everyone is able to do it

286
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:52,360
basically you just extract the SD card

287
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:55,390
and launch show favorite forensic tools

288
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:58,480
photo right for example you grab all

289
00:16:55,390 --> 00:17:01,060
deleted files on current files and if by

290
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,040
chance you have one or many payload that

291
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:07,240
bin files is just a payload of the

292
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:11,709
rubber ducky so you can use some Perl

293
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:13,660
script to get P load in clear text so

294
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:15,669
basically the PowerShell script executed

295
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:18,100
or any comments type

296
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:20,169
just remember one things the payload is

297
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:22,990
keyboard layout dependence so if you are

298
00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:25,529
in a dirty take care or you will get a

299
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:27,909
very very crappy

300
00:17:25,529 --> 00:17:31,690
payload in clear-text so you won't be

301
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:34,210
able to exploit it directly basically

302
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:37,330
this could be also used in case if you

303
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:40,659
use a Raspberry Pi zero for example you

304
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:45,250
just grab the SD card of the P and you

305
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:48,850
should be able to do some forensics in

306
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:51,520
okay for the win injector we need inside

307
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:55,330
the mouth and it could be either inside

308
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:57,970
any USB device with the new space so if

309
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:59,649
you retrieve this malicious mouth and

310
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:03,279
you open it you will see there is

311
00:17:59,649 --> 00:18:08,729
something suspicious inside and you try

312
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:13,890
to analyze all the components when we

313
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:18,399
find the wiki model and you see some

314
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:20,740
shield try to remove it and you can find

315
00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:31,020
something interesting like this flash

316
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:36,640
device so try to go as easier first so

317
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:39,399
in the other side the easier task in

318
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:45,100
this case is to install those flash

319
00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:47,860
memory and try to damp it so let's go we

320
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:52,750
inserted all right try to avoid to

321
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:56,439
phrase it and you say you sell it back

322
00:18:52,750 --> 00:19:00,640
on the breadboard you connected to break

323
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:04,419
out and you try to connect through SPI

324
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:09,429
pins and you make some praise and you

325
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:13,960
try to dump it this case in go very well

326
00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:17,140
and we are over to dump it and as a

327
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,559
reverse engineer you try to make a drink

328
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:22,360
first

329
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:27,279
of course and you see that you have some

330
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:29,469
intangible data with a password so let's

331
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:32,020
try to continue the investigation but

332
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:35,049
before if flash form that we use

333
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:37,220
previously don't work you can use a tool

334
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:40,610
like Adwords to

335
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:44,140
Torche the dire key to your chip you

336
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:48,289
grab your data cheat and you find

337
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:51,890
restriction to to read to the chip to

338
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:55,280
the memory and you can use directly as I

339
00:19:51,890 --> 00:20:00,830
previous to send the the easy order to

340
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:04,549
read the data so now we have the data we

341
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:08,389
grab inside the dump and we can find

342
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:10,879
really interesting data so we have the

343
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:13,940
wiggly configuration we have some Intel

344
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:19,580
about the attackers for the instance is

345
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:23,380
really the shadow of after and you'll

346
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:30,980
find some interesting like pillowed so

347
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:37,010
the question now is are we able to grab

348
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:40,940
the extra extracted file so in the data

349
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:47,120
is Toro as unread a bunch of chunk of

350
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:49,610
data so when you record them and we we

351
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:52,340
assume them we can retrieve the

352
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:56,629
exfiltrated data and in this case that

353
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:59,270
shows just stole a logo but we are we

354
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:04,159
were able to grab the data store inside

355
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:08,918
the evil mouth so it's a big win for us

356
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:12,530
and is its has been a really interesting

357
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:19,909
investigation on this side but what if

358
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:25,010
you found this kind of device you open

359
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:29,570
it again and this device is teeny as

360
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:36,020
 and make really really pansy ass to

361
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:40,580
them so you try to identify the

362
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:44,418
components and as we see is there is lot

363
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:47,178
of blue on the device and when you put

364
00:21:44,419 --> 00:21:52,210
up the glue there is no more indication

365
00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:56,419
on the chip appellee

366
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:59,480
the program is on github so when we grab

367
00:21:56,419 --> 00:22:08,380
some info we found that the

368
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:14,600
microcontroller is a 1984-85 and the

369
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:18,409
Bluetooth module so for the TTE the

370
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:20,270
perfect method the best one is to

371
00:22:18,409 --> 00:22:21,260
validate you method before try to them

372
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:24,139
the chip

373
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:27,440
yotaka change it directly so in my case

374
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:31,299
I have another one memory for the test

375
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:37,159
not the same package but the same chip

376
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:42,500
ok so you connect to the chip and you

377
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:48,590
try after to connect on the little one

378
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:51,440
and this one is really tricky you have

379
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:55,580
to take your time to do micro micro

380
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:58,789
micro so during you solder on a strip in

381
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:02,500
place with a pin you trip you check your

382
00:22:58,789 --> 00:23:06,440
connection and you try to dump it but

383
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:14,390
for whatever reason this chip is not

384
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:18,260
detected by your material you come again

385
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:22,880
use on the ring took a check do it three

386
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:30,169
times in a row the thing and you try to

387
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:32,090
do connect directly another another we

388
00:23:30,169 --> 00:23:35,990
will try to connect directly another

389
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:39,740
device we have to see if if I bomb the

390
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:43,549
chip but I go through my first rule to

391
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:46,029
not collect the suspicious devices on

392
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:48,950
your computer and fun-packed when you

393
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:51,169
directly solve those the pin on the PCB

394
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:55,640
and you ate the common line on average

395
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:59,960
to dump the pillow is a the contents the

396
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:02,120
device starts the first period so it

397
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,990
could be a game over and you see that

398
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,428
interference

399
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:10,309
will do

400
00:24:04,429 --> 00:24:14,059
things so at this time we're still

401
00:24:10,309 --> 00:24:18,019
looking what is the region for the fail

402
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:22,129
but as far as I know there is no read

403
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:25,580
protection set the chip has been probed

404
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:30,830
by five volt and maybe it's too much but

405
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:34,610
it's unlikely I think honestly that I

406
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:36,889
burn the chip when I chip it off so it's

407
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:41,090
happened happen all the time

408
00:24:36,889 --> 00:24:45,949
so if you have any idea of feedback come

409
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:51,740
to us please and I will try to them the

410
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:56,720
other one that got left so some

411
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:58,940
takeaways we will continue to work on

412
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:05,419
the new upcoming device that I'll show

413
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:07,490
you we have a main objective to write a

414
00:25:05,419 --> 00:25:10,970
white paper to share as much information

415
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:15,200
as possible because uh thirty-minute is

416
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:20,860
quite complicated and we try to share

417
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:24,649
the data for next year and last world

418
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:27,549
there is still love to be done in France

419
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:30,918
six field on this kind of implant

420
00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:32,720
nowadays this kind of electronics is no

421
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:38,720
longer reserved to stitch from Saudagar

422
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:39,950
so be ready for any red team and the key

423
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,889
to success for this kind of

424
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:46,249
investigation is to equipment and

425
00:25:42,889 --> 00:25:49,449
practice and don't be afraid to fail

426
00:25:46,249 --> 00:25:52,960
because this is the base of the life

427
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:52,960
thank you for attention

428
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:08,780
since thought for your talk are there

429
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:12,950
any questions or comments yes hi thanks

430
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:15,649
of a photo torque for the evil mouse did

431
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:23,300
you did it show up as a - Mouse with a

432
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:28,580
USB hub did you'd do connect directly as

433
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:36,860
a mouse sensor on the on the device okay

434
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:41,470
I will get back to the parts yeah here

435
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:45,919
you don't see very well but there is

436
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:49,460
there is a USB up here so you have the

437
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:52,040
curved device of the mouth and with

438
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:56,990
bleed out into side as we cable and

439
00:26:52,040 --> 00:27:00,350
there is a USB app so the wind injector

440
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:02,840
is not directly connected on the PCB

441
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:04,820
Mouse yeah - to answer I think you of

442
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:11,570
both device connected at the same time

443
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:13,879
you have the mass on the fakey bond I've

444
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:16,129
served this problem with my my first

445
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:19,970
Mouse because I used that in --see on

446
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:24,110
the tin see is a is checking all is took

447
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:28,010
took all the the sensors like the wheel

448
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:29,659
the move sensor X not uncertainty on the

449
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:33,350
each show only as a mouse on the

450
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:37,220
keyboard so it's it's less float next

451
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:37,639
level solutions other questions or

452
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:50,990
comments

453
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:52,850
a quick question regarding I would be

454
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:56,180
you detect because you have many people

455
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:59,959
inside your company how do you detect

456
00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:01,820
such so low we can say signal inside the

457
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,620
mass even if you have you seem I don't

458
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:06,740
think with the same you are able to find

459
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:11,330
any a PNP no I think yes the only

460
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:14,389
solution is to use to relay on

461
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:16,549
I think idea detection or the powerful

462
00:28:14,389 --> 00:28:18,889
script executes she does some behavior

463
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:21,529
malicious behavior because we told

464
00:28:18,889 --> 00:28:24,619
yesterday night with some people about

465
00:28:21,529 --> 00:28:27,789
the detection and yeah you probably will

466
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:31,249
be able to do some detection on the

467
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:34,009
typing speed for example you should be

468
00:28:31,249 --> 00:28:36,289
detect when you plug multiple devices at

469
00:28:34,009 --> 00:28:38,720
the same time but basically at work we

470
00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:41,239
have what we call Flex office so we

471
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:46,549
don't have dedicated desk for one people

472
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:48,739
so your change of desk every day and the

473
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:51,918
keyboard and the mouse are already

474
00:28:48,739 --> 00:28:53,359
connected so on a dog so you just came

475
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,359
you plug the doctor your computer

476
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:59,658
through USB and if this kind of device

477
00:28:56,359 --> 00:29:02,119
either hidden under the desk we can't do

478
00:28:59,659 --> 00:29:05,869
anything so we just have to relay on

479
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:09,019
later step detection but we know that we

480
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:13,820
can maybe get in the past and detect

481
00:29:09,019 --> 00:29:17,739
what happens I think we have the time

482
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:17,739
for one more question or a comment

483
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:29,600
Guto so when imagine you would gather

484
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:32,299
the windows event data or other data you

485
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,759
can gather on all the machines in the

486
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:37,249
institution would you be able to

487
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:44,690
recognize the activity if you have the

488
00:29:37,249 --> 00:29:49,309
logs obviously I don't know it's depend

489
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:52,100
of many log you have two eyes and it

490
00:29:49,309 --> 00:30:00,950
could be tricky to detect this kind of

491
00:29:52,100 --> 00:30:04,129
pattern needle in the haystack I don't

492
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:09,169
know on this guy I know I'm not on the

493
00:30:04,129 --> 00:30:12,049
side of the same so honestly I don't

494
00:30:09,169 --> 00:30:17,440
know and in this in this case we have

495
00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:20,809
presented we were in the best logs

496
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:23,600
possibilities I think and we clearly

497
00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:25,280
don't have that actually so we don't

498
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:29,419
even know if we would be a

499
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:32,389
to do this things exactly with the

500
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:35,150
looking capabilities we have now and if

501
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:37,670
we have to search on all the workstation

502
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:39,290
we have a nineteen thousand workstation

503
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:43,160
if our two session or the workstations

504
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:49,159
accompany it will take a very very long

505
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:52,100
time probably a too long time but maybe

506
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:54,830
if you have some patterns as I shall we

507
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:56,840
do with delivery maybe we can just try

508
00:30:54,830 --> 00:31:00,470
to grab people talking with the website

509
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:05,449
and we will be able to detect on one

510
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:07,370
computer basically okay thank you

511
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:09,680
and feel free to take additional

512
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:12,739
questions or comments to the cocktail

513
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:14,800
afterwards let us thank our speakers

514
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,800
again
