1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:10,120
welcome to my talk he will talk about

2
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:13,509
what Heidi security and the hot damn

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:16,360
venerable Heidi device first of all who

4
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:17,679
am i I'm Hana kotti I'm a security pen

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:21,490
tester at super stea

6
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:24,119
in Toulouse I'm a hijacker security and

7
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:30,130
geek and I'm a higher key security

8
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:34,090
Adventist what we'll talk about for us

9
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:39,010
why we are interesting about higher G

10
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:42,840
hacking we take focus about to hack the

11
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:46,559
higher G world and we will explore the

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:52,180
top ten who was peyote with real-life

13
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:56,530
example also I would like explain you

14
00:00:52,180 --> 00:01:01,030
how could we learn step by step hiking

15
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:03,730
with a DVID project and I will explain a

16
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:07,090
DVID objective children's project

17
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:10,210
project timeline we rated product and I

18
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:13,920
tried to make a live demo with the hood

19
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:19,869
video and we make a conclusion about

20
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:22,540
DVID what not why we are interested in

21
00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:26,170
hijacking first heidi is a growing

22
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:28,600
market in next four years there is full

23
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,880
more times there are 4 times more

24
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:34,149
connected device around the world and

25
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,960
whole markets become an IT leader like

26
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:40,960
industry transports how health but also

27
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,970
there is a new pardon in the past where

28
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,939
an attacker would like to ax to attack

29
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:50,590
you server he must follow and access

30
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:54,008
only open ports like SMB est FTP or HTTP

31
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:59,409
so blue team could make some sauce on

32
00:01:54,009 --> 00:02:02,969
ports and detect what attacker do in

33
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:07,350
future the attacker could make we could

34
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:11,549
get many information offline

35
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:13,530
in this example you have smartwatch who

36
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,660
communicates with a smartphone like

37
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:20,250
hundred application and after to the

38
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:23,579
cloud and before to make requests to the

39
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:25,140
cloud the attacker could reverse the

40
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:29,570
SmartWatch reverse the unruly

41
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:35,390
application and get under on how the

42
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:39,359
system works before make some requests

43
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:42,420
so IT security assessment there is two

44
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,270
meters to assess security firstly the

45
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:48,600
pen test pen test you are engage on time

46
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:51,930
not on results you must follow Haneda

47
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:55,079
sport process and you will receive money

48
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:58,560
even if you find CVS ephah

49
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:03,480
if you if you find vulnerabilities with

50
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:06,870
the score CSS I'm use them too but in

51
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:10,140
bug bounty you are hanging on wizard not

52
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:13,260
on time you can spend six months to find

53
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:16,950
a vulnerability you must find an expert

54
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:19,380
table Vanara witty to get money and you

55
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:22,500
need to be the first to discover this

56
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:31,109
vulnerability if you wanted to duplicate

57
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:35,100
and you can just go through next so go

58
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:40,709
to up the hockey world I would like to

59
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:44,760
take the top 10 who asperity with and I

60
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:48,390
will illustrate it by real-life example

61
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,940
on hardware you can find weak visible or

62
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:53,809
hard-coded password insecure default

63
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:56,370
settings or lack of physical hardening

64
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:59,100
about the middleware like Android

65
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:01,640
application on iOS you can find unsecure

66
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:05,100
core system interface lack of security

67
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:09,869
mechanism or use or insecure or how

68
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:12,859
dated component on the heck change you

69
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:18,700
can find some insecure data transfer or

70
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:22,100
storage and the Hans code you can find

71
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:26,830
insecure network services but in margin

72
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:29,320
ARR you can find a policy and management

73
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:31,669
vulnerabilities like insufficient of

74
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:39,400
insufficients of previously protection

75
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:42,560
or in secret that no sorry

76
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,780
so let's go to the first one we get

77
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,410
severe ha we did pass around you have

78
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:51,229
received an IP camera for Christmas but

79
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:53,120
you don't have the root password and the

80
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:56,270
the root password is not providing in

81
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,220
the manual so you can download the

82
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,530
firmware or the support website

83
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:04,010
manufacturer website like support

84
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:06,890
company.com you can use bin work to

85
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:10,190
extract it automatically you can find

86
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:13,280
its GPS and partition inside and you can

87
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:18,740
use a correct tool Jefferson to extract

88
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:21,260
it you will find language file system

89
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:24,020
and you can use general Ripper to crack

90
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:28,780
it the password is simple I know but

91
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:28,780
Zuma is not provided in the manual about

92
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:35,210
insecure Network Services how does your

93
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:38,030
phone access to the high P stream so you

94
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:40,669
have camera you plug it on a network and

95
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:44,330
you just guess could scan it with hand

96
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:47,750
map and you find it's a her TSP protocol

97
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:52,640
so you can use a script with an map like

98
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:55,580
your TSP - URL mini spirit to find URL

99
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:59,210
to access the stream when you find it

100
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:02,030
you can use VLC to be connected to it

101
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:06,520
and you can take a - on show then to

102
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:13,340
find a useful IP stream like in Raju or

103
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:16,280
Chinese office about this free and

104
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:20,000
secure system interface could you access

105
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:22,789
to program services here you device is

106
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,820
temperature sensor and a primer access

107
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:27,760
from primer a premium service offer

108
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:34,719
access to all

109
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:39,670
the device sunsource so I don't I won't

110
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:43,060
like to to pay so service is insecure

111
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:47,470
used in secure API that hello you two

112
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:50,380
overall all devices so the activation

113
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:53,530
key is a decoration and the serial

114
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:58,050
number is predictable with two things I

115
00:06:53,530 --> 00:07:01,719
can for my attack your account I cannot

116
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:06,790
account and I go to I can go to data

117
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:09,550
mining to reverse engineer to reverse

118
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:14,890
and Jenna a access to whole other device

119
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:17,770
sunsource about lack of securitate

120
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:21,729
mechanism how to unlock advanced

121
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:24,690
features here from non-wide application

122
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:29,380
you can get the few more directly

123
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:31,600
because on the there is no information

124
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,670
in manual to get an update you must

125
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:37,540
follow as a process in the handled

126
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:41,530
application so you can download it you

127
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:45,760
can extract with extract ministry a more

128
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:48,789
adult SH it's similar to bin work but

129
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:53,140
you can we built it as a few more after

130
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:56,940
so you can explore it and you can modify

131
00:07:53,140 --> 00:08:00,820
the few more to unlock advanced features

132
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:03,969
when done you can rebuild as the

133
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:08,320
firmware we applaud and flash the device

134
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:11,110
and access here the there is no

135
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:16,510
signature encryption on the firmware and

136
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:21,340
no fumer encryption to protect the

137
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:25,270
device from this vinovich about use of

138
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:29,520
insecure howdy chief component how to

copy to copy physical fi di a very key

140
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:36,189
here you have an alarm system

141
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:38,940
we need the that of Mifare classic badge

142
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:44,220
like a visit for example

143
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:48,560
and how dated knife your classic veg

144
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:51,870
have a sensible to to venerable cheese

145
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:55,650
nested and actually attacks and you can

00:08:51,870 --> 00:09:00,420
done in a couple of minutes a simple

147
00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:05,280
copy so here you can find the copy with

148
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:10,439
an and a write of our team process

149
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:13,949
in a Chinese page for example about

150
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:16,260
insufficient privacy protection the use

151
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:19,560
cases to how to track physical movement

152
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:20,850
of a user while staying seated on your

153
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,280
share

154
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:28,220
here are some application for you to

155
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:28,220
share your location with friends family

156
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:38,640
but this application use hemp and PTT

157
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:41,849
protocol to share the geolocation to the

158
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:46,350
server and offer a subscription process

159
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:49,970
to all your family and friends so you

160
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:53,700
can find the hem PTT server on children

161
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:58,020
because as a topic of amputee is the

162
00:09:53,700 --> 00:10:00,510
name of the application so you can get

163
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:03,390
every two minutes as a location of all

164
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:06,840
family and friends and you can map all

165
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:10,230
of them with a simple script and see all

166
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:13,920
movement around today and see as that

167
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:20,790
there's a where they live and where they

168
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:26,569
walk about in secure data transfer and

169
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:31,760
storage here how to were basically you

170
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:35,250
some padlock and found interior of

171
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:38,580
Brutus features to be unlocked with a

172
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:40,640
mobile phone and for example you use

173
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:44,450
case you can

174
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:48,740
gives the right to unlock the padlock to

175
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:50,320
a friend a padlock received orders from

176
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:56,200
an application so Bluetooth Low Energy

177
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:59,780
here you can just listen to traffic and

178
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:02,690
extract there is three orders as first

179
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:06,410
one is to wake up that lock padlock the

180
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:10,040
second one is to put the cut here is

181
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:15,469
zero zero zero and the next is to unlock

182
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:19,310
order as the bad so a simple relay of

183
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:20,080
captured command allow you to unlock the

184
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:23,810
padlock

185
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:30,640
there is no nonce protection allowed pre

186
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:34,579
pre attacks so I didn't do this a stack

187
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:37,670
at the metro station because unlocking

188
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,450
is simple but I can look I can't lock

189
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:44,719
padlock

190
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:50,000
so after script all shocked not that I

191
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:52,120
can't lock them physically so I I stay

192
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,270
here

193
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:58,730
about lack of device management how to

194
00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:01,100
spoof a physical access patch here a

195
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:03,560
physical access badge was moved to a

196
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:07,070
smartphone application and publishing

197
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:09,560
and the company publish non secure

198
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:13,820
application hello to attacker to

199
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:17,420
reverse-engineer the protocol so the

200
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:21,760
application is not office gated so you

201
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:25,750
can just winter called understand it and

202
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:31,250
write one key on the application so that

203
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:34,460
I make them I made them and the

204
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:38,390
application ask me which power which

205
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:42,230
door you would like to to open just

206
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:46,400
enter the number and the application as

207
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:50,560
a wild account application emulates the

208
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,560
badge and unlock the door

209
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:56,399
about in

210
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:59,279
security for settings here you can have

211
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:02,009
fun with default credentials you can

212
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:05,910
take your look on mirror I saw Scott and

213
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:09,600
get an take this dictionary of password

214
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:13,439
and you can just connect to be to your

215
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,689
IP camera for example but here you have

216
00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:20,910
a wit password that you can change it

217
00:13:15,689 --> 00:13:25,019
because the by default some many IP

218
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:30,059
cameras walked on with your new mode so

219
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:32,939
you must flash the firmware to to patch

220
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:35,730
the vulnerability and you have a 50/50

221
00:13:32,939 --> 00:13:38,790
chance to break the device if you bring

222
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:43,759
another summer so it's venerable and you

223
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:47,069
can do seven of nothing about the last

224
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:49,619
point how to extract protected firmware

225
00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:52,019
so you can download from the

226
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:57,540
manufacturer website only encrypt it

227
00:13:52,019 --> 00:14:03,149
reamer so you can first you can find you

228
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:07,319
out poor to access limited shell or load

229
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:12,059
to hot date process to inspect the C's

230
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:14,849
memory here there's pictures of us pas

231
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:18,149
and also you can access to a boot

232
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:21,629
sequences with for example TFTP and if

233
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:27,629
the FTP protocol reasonable you can read

234
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:32,999
the memory and extract data to to a

235
00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:38,160
server so what you put on we learn how

236
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:41,459
to challenge the Hovis top 10 high ot we

237
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:44,009
learned that to improve yourself you can

238
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:47,518
read write-ups and try yourself

239
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:51,749
and world world high device during for

240
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:53,660
example between three programs but you

241
00:14:51,749 --> 00:14:57,929
need or thought we proved yourself with

242
00:14:53,660 --> 00:15:01,439
open sourced venerable system and I

243
00:14:57,929 --> 00:15:04,400
develop for that Divya AG project so

244
00:15:01,439 --> 00:15:08,060
what is VI D project

245
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:11,360
it's a damn venerable high device is a

246
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:13,339
first open-source IOT project designed

247
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,130
to be vulnerable

248
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:18,980
it gives in to interesting people a

249
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:24,500
venerable board to improve their skills

250
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:28,190
in a hijacking is cheap less than 40

251
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:31,940
euro is simple only one non-covalent

252
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:34,880
like atmega328p and could be bought

253
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:38,270
easily or just do it yourself with a

254
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:40,189
Java files han beetle you can find more

255
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:44,800
details on the official website

256
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:50,720
DJ et tu and there is no official shop

257
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:54,109
today because I don't have time to to to

258
00:15:50,720 --> 00:16:01,490
applaud it so just contact me on the

259
00:15:54,110 --> 00:16:04,330
Twitter so about children DVID project

260
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:08,120
as a reason that were part with abroad

261
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:11,420
and had me gas with 2 HP is same like a

262
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:15,140
hard we know you know but it's a custom

263
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:18,729
board the reason OLED screen a regulator

264
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:23,770
for the Wi-Fi board and the status LED

265
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:27,110
used for flashing process for example

266
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:31,400
about communication poor you are you

267
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:34,400
have hot flash with USB HP and you asked

268
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:37,370
Paul for access to serial console for

269
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:39,829
example and the limited channel about

270
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:42,290
communication you have Bluetooth with a

271
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:47,450
high team in you zero nine priests

272
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:52,490
adapter feature and the Wi-Fi with an HP

273
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:54,350
8 2 6 6 the full package is 42 always

274
00:16:52,490 --> 00:17:01,640
included you just need to have a

275
00:16:54,350 --> 00:17:06,560
computer so the project is simple in

276
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:09,410
order to learn how to to exploit a

277
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:11,540
vulnerability and you just have switch

278
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:14,240
tabs the first one is to flash the

279
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:16,619
corresponding famer on the DVID the

280
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:21,420
first 2 is to understand objectives

281
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:24,198
start to haddock and the step three is

282
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:27,089
to find vulnerabilities and exploit them

283
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:31,860
simple here you have an example for the

284
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:34,970
half body pass for training with the

285
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:38,760
progression process about time line

286
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:42,780
support the project started on the

287
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:47,129
February of this year with the prototype

288
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:53,660
so it will be very beautiful now there

289
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:56,990
is no not even a word God yet on March

290
00:17:53,660 --> 00:18:06,150
position process is engaged with

291
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:06,780
soldering and since May there is a Hindi

292
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:10,200
ish

293
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:12,928
yearning course with Aki 9 and Hebrew

294
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:16,800
sect conference for example and I

295
00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:20,670
present the project at author event like

296
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:26,309
hysteric French Iranian course grack

297
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:29,670
here and 6 egg v2 on November and net

298
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:36,840
secure days in war in December today

299
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:41,880
there is 250 boards sent worldwide for

300
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:46,699
example for to make one board you must

301
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:51,440
spend 15 minutes so you can imagine as

302
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:55,410
so huge time to make the little letters

303
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:59,910
about functionalities there is about at

304
00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:03,510
where you can try to board analysis like

305
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:07,710
review all layers and what what the

306
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:10,170
developer write on it about film area is

307
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:12,929
the extraction the fervor flow default

308
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:15,690
password or are coded password about

309
00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:19,440
Brutus is replay attacks scan from

310
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:22,530
venerable devices device femur hot date

311
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:25,760
for example and about Wi-Fi its

312
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:30,820
venerable web interfaces

313
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:34,490
man's demeanor headaches for example so

314
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:41,299
the project is a cool but there is also

315
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:47,090
really eight seed projects first package

316
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:50,510
so I have some of them in my by but it's

317
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:53,000
available for everyone it could be sent

318
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:57,139
to a worldwide it contains all other and

319
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:01,820
all other way to unneeded attack tours

320
00:19:57,139 --> 00:20:05,178
you just have to you just need to have a

321
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:09,950
computer and optional course it's

322
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:13,370
currently in development but also there

323
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:15,470
is a briefcase is dedicated to physical

324
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:19,389
course for example for teacher

325
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:23,149
it contains 20 DVID full package board

326
00:20:19,389 --> 00:20:27,709
flashed a flash station and the

327
00:20:23,149 --> 00:20:31,699
scoreboard for the final exam but also I

328
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:35,450
developed an escape game yes yeah is a

329
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:37,639
live game for ten players maximum ten

330
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:40,850
players because there is many

331
00:20:37,639 --> 00:20:46,299
interference with with Brutus so if we

332
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:49,490
are 100 in in a room you can do nothing

333
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:51,918
it's focused on protocol exploration

334
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:55,779
like Hardware Bluetooth on the read and

335
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:59,870
cloud protocol there is a life

336
00:20:55,779 --> 00:21:02,690
scoreboard and player follow-up and the

337
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:06,979
first worries is that six leg event on

338
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:09,950
the thirty of November the scenario is

339
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:12,769
simple you see C's o is asking you to

340
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:15,559
investigate about security failure on

341
00:21:12,769 --> 00:21:17,990
the production line and your sir

342
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:21,139
compactor seems to be hacked and the

343
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:23,870
back door might to be installed so this

344
00:21:21,139 --> 00:21:30,610
objective and you have just one over to

345
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:34,059
find the village so it's not enough

346
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:44,320
there is board games

347
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:46,869
I have time with superstars of all is

348
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:52,960
the currency development it's a real

349
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:55,330
case 2d dedicated to companies so for

350
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,330
example it's a thermal supervision of

351
00:21:55,330 --> 00:22:01,869
cold chain physical access detection

352
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:06,369
system Beauty technical level I would

353
00:22:01,869 --> 00:22:12,249
like - to a fun to give access to this

354
00:22:06,369 --> 00:22:14,649
game to beginners and nails but it's

355
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:18,759
limited to companies follow because

356
00:22:14,649 --> 00:22:21,879
companies have money to pay my research

357
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:26,169
and development so so far no is

358
00:22:21,879 --> 00:22:37,139
dedicated to to companies so the most

359
00:22:26,169 --> 00:22:47,769
IMF so you have here it's real because

360
00:22:37,139 --> 00:22:51,399
support is in the box so we are here

361
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:56,190
it's the Bluetooth mean it's a Bluetooth

362
00:22:51,399 --> 00:23:02,399
training you just have the objective

363
00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:09,339
command to say hello on the z400 ffd one

364
00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:13,389
so if you do some Bluetooth attack you

365
00:23:09,339 --> 00:23:17,049
can see that may-maybe it's it's a

366
00:23:13,389 --> 00:23:21,998
Brutus characteristic so you can first

367
00:23:17,049 --> 00:23:29,460
scan Bluetooth devices so state or Haley

368
00:23:21,999 --> 00:23:36,210
scan will give you

369
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:39,960
opportunity to see the DVD board so I

370
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:47,549
have the MAC address or Steve ID and I

371
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:50,970
can use a bleeped tool with me with - e

372
00:23:47,549 --> 00:23:55,799
to explore characteristic of the device

373
00:23:50,970 --> 00:24:01,919
please don't do say same as me because

374
00:23:55,799 --> 00:24:05,730
you will fail so that we will connect to

375
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:12,480
the Seaboard and scan all things about

376
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:17,940
it and and you can see that if if e1 is

377
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:24,480
a we are like really real characteristic

378
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:26,429
and as eucharistic as right right so you

379
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,610
can try to send hello to this

380
00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:33,450
characteristic so you can

381
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:39,889
use the same tool bleah - be the McHale

382
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:44,070
West I mean use default data hello - and

383
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:51,150
photo characteristic artistic is here 0

384
00:24:44,070 --> 00:25:04,950
0 to 5 so we will connect to the ball

385
00:24:51,150 --> 00:25:13,560
and you will see anyway what in extra

386
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:20,070
Matt is bitter enteral past hello and

387
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:23,450
the challenge is is completed so the

388
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:23,450
demo is food successful

389
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:40,060
so I would like to take focus on the on

390
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:45,219
warm-up so the escape game is not enough

391
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:47,950
about time as a board game also I plan

392
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:50,440
to do more trainings and on more

393
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:51,220
protocol like four three three

394
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:55,210
McGarrett's

395
00:25:51,220 --> 00:26:01,380
what your frequency ZigBee Mabuse for

396
00:25:55,210 --> 00:26:05,050
industrial devices and aloha of sick fox

397
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:08,080
for cloud communication i also would

398
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:12,070
like to develop newbies starting kit

399
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:15,610
because I have some beginners to that

400
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:18,850
board my my project I would like to

401
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:23,320
develop all-in-one interface with course

402
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:28,360
and guidelines to do trainings and viral

403
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:31,470
course with live interaction but also I

404
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:36,580
would like to develop the DVID version 2

405
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:41,390
with a Bluetooth saya 5.16 fox of canvas

406
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:45,839
so thank you for your attention

407
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:45,839
[Applause]

408
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:54,820
exhaust for the talk in the demo I think

409
00:26:53,080 --> 00:27:02,080
we have the time for a couple of

410
00:26:54,820 --> 00:27:06,550
questions thanks for the talk two

411
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:09,159
questions the first one is your divisive

412
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:16,600
venerable to Bluebonnet AK on the blue

413
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:20,560
stack and the second one it's a read for

414
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:25,090
the Assembly of the board do you do you

415
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:29,800
check CPC be a SMT assembly tool to make

416
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:37,139
about automatically here on the broad is

417
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:37,139
a traversal thundering only because I

418
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:46,060
would like to allow to all people to

419
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:50,139
solve as a bot so I would like to have a

420
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:53,980
simple board but I understand that the

421
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:59,400
process soldering process is take more

422
00:27:53,980 --> 00:28:04,500
times because I can go to - Chinese -

423
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:08,560
chill out - to build the board

424
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:12,540
automatically that I am now today all is

425
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:18,600
due in two rows I have friends that

426
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:24,450
would like to solder so sources of the

427
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:28,540
all 50 and 105 500 mobiles

428
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:31,570
today transition yeah

429
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:34,180
the first question was about blue burner

430
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:38,399
and the Bluetooth stack if it's a

431
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:38,400
neighbor yes or no

432
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:49,260
[Laughter]

433
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:54,120
you'll have to get the board and try it

434
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:55,440
out okay let's thank our or maybe we

435
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:59,929
have time for one more question

436
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:04,950
last one yes any takers

437
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:07,350
actually one question for me how long

438
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:08,670
did you actually spend on this on this

439
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:10,860
project if you had an assessment of

440
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:13,110
number of hours and did you do this as

441
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:19,459
part of your work or on your private

442
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:23,090
time it's totally in a private time it's

443
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:29,060
absolutely not correlated to super Saiya

444
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:29,060
companies about time

445
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:44,129
more than 300 hours night and weekends

446
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:47,730
so yes but today some painful function

447
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:53,670
like so during old bones it's done by

448
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:56,750
your friends so I can focus myself on

449
00:29:53,670 --> 00:30:02,190
the development of the old world map and

450
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:05,870
ask a game or a board game ok great

451
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:05,870
let's thank our speaker again
