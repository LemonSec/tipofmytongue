1
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:10,389
okay so my name is Eric and I have five

2
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:12,519
minutes to tell you about a pitiful

3
00:00:10,389 --> 00:00:16,329
story which is more or less a kind of

4
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:19,179
sad fickle drama in four acts so let's

5
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:21,580
start with act number one so everything

6
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:23,619
started on October 12 because we add

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:26,320
miss with my friends the first wave of

8
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:29,198
ticketing so this this day was the most

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,500
important one we wanted to get to the

10
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,840
tickets to grey acts so we were already

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,250
on time everything was prepared in text

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,170
editors to fasten the copy/paste

13
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:41,110
operations who have synchronizes in

14
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:42,940
whatsapp everything was cool even the

15
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:45,039
refresh because if you refer to mush

16
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,199
maybe you can be blamed by the seller so

17
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:52,090
we didn't know but everything was okay

18
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:55,480
and at 1000 refresh so on my side

19
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:58,180
nothing changed so mmm-hmm

20
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:01,300
panic so maybe it's a JavaScript bird so

21
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:03,789
I started another browser no UI change

22
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,740
so how can I buy a seat so in post

23
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:08,140
brothers doing refreshes and nothing

24
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:12,339
changed so it was really a kind of panic

25
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:14,170
and being on the phone my friend said we

26
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,840
have with tickets and so on my site I

27
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:19,240
did last reversion it was finished so I

28
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:23,829
can I cannot make the wiki now but it

29
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:26,679
was it was horrible yes I was a little

30
00:01:23,829 --> 00:01:28,960
bit upset so thank you for the wiki so

31
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,670
blame or not blame so I chose to be

32
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,059
cooler of course because I was not the

33
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:37,030
only one so but there was a bit upset so

34
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:38,979
act to Monday back to work so with my

35
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:40,899
friends so of course the friends have

36
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:43,119
bitter drugs and they said there are

37
00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:44,799
your pros are not talking and so on but

38
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,930
the friends are also cool because they

39
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,000
are looking at the site and I didn't and

40
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:50,409
you could steal by a benefactor of

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,960
tickets from the site it was still

42
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:54,430
available and the guy said oh hey you

43
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,750
can choose the price you play and you

44
00:01:54,430 --> 00:02:01,119
can control the price you type and it's

45
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:03,520
only a JavaScript with mean you got no

46
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:08,770
seriously so in that case you have just

47
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:11,540
one refreshed to start of course Firebug

48
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:13,910
and so I was very curious because you

49
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:16,190
could have some kind of a biscuit in

50
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:17,660
JavaScript or things like that so let's

51
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,190
go so if you don't know how to use

52
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,980
forever you click the magic arrow you

53
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:24,290
click to the to the widget then if you

54
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,030
look at something coffee and in the

55
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:29,239
source no seeing so you try again as a

56
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:30,710
upper-level component once twice on the

57
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,680
third try I found something super

58
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:36,290
interesting so I said no Trudy is not

59
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,850
possible so edit the value and set the

60
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:41,630
price that I should have paid on

61
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:44,930
Saturday and so I said cannot work is

62
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:52,490
not possible so I click because I'm

63
00:02:44,930 --> 00:03:00,650
curious so it seemed to work so yes yes

64
00:02:52,490 --> 00:03:04,490
yes so so are you sure so because it's a

65
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:06,230
little bit illegal you know so so the

66
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:09,440
balance is that on one side you have

67
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:11,390
with this event which is not the victim

68
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,370
because I'm using abusing the system but

69
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:15,769
the real victim is good a great team and

70
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:22,820
it's the security conference so I said

71
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:26,209
ok maybe I could negotiate so so as I'm

72
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:28,010
ridiculous I try to click on by and of

73
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:30,650
course he didn't work also it works of

74
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,370
course and so I was a benefactor

75
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:34,909
[Applause]

76
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,909
[Music]

77
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:42,430
[Music]

78
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:43,840
but Austin we have a problem because due

79
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,940
to the ticket number maybe I was the

80
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,920
first one so it means that the team

81
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,390
would be curious about how much I paid

82
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,980
to the cause because you could choose

83
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:57,459
the price but I didn't choose the good

84
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:59,109
one so will I be caught or not act 3 I

85
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:06,060
know before I Street just in case more

86
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:06,060
you know that already so x3 so of course

87
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:15,880
so I received an arrow it was a yes it

88
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:17,500
was 22 p.m. so it was a moment it so I

89
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,630
have led the velvety Mia

90
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,579
so for non French people I will

91
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:24,700
translate so I'm not going to die today

92
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:27,700
so the price was very little people had

93
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:29,469
fun with that the mayor also suggested

94
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,090
that I had to make a responsible

95
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:33,490
disclosure to the people from with event

96
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:36,010
because they are a little bit problems

97
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,930
on the outside and there was a fun

98
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,560
punishment number one you should present

99
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:44,410
a ramp

100
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:46,390
okay so and and of course you should

101
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:48,820
present the exploit so now that you know

102
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:52,630
the exploit so maybe I would run geek at

103
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:55,120
as yes as a fact here my levers minus

104
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:58,750
one and the scale of famous scale of

105
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:02,710
safety so thanks master so this is

106
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:04,240
clearly not affecting a level eight and

107
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:06,010
of course on the more under Moreau

108
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,370
I sent a maid in the morning to receive

109
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:11,409
aunt and say I tried to explain not

110
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:14,770
explain the problem but said there is a

111
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:18,520
problem and so fortunately it was

112
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:21,010
already fixed but at night at night so

113
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,150
very late because I was it's curious

114
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,669
about what would be the reason the

115
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:26,760
response so once again for non French

116
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:30,340
people are we're not going to join today

117
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:32,230
and there was a second punishment so you

118
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:35,320
have to make an advertisement that we

119
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:37,900
have eight eight position open and

120
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,550
outside and I think that the in this

121
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:43,530
kind of conference people will be very

122
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:47,490
very happy to to contribute so else okay

123
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:50,619
so at number four today

124
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:55,749
so guess what I have to make an

125
00:05:50,619 --> 00:05:57,339
advertisement for eight positions so I

126
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:59,409
invite you to click because it's super

127
00:05:57,339 --> 00:06:01,629
interesting on the side I will not tell

128
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:06,380
you what you will guess if you look at

129
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:09,509
the positions and that's it ok

130
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,509
[Applause]
