1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:11,559
okay hello hello everybody so thank you

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:17,529
thank you heartily to all of you for

3
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:22,448
coming to gray Hawk in fact I'm speaking

4
00:00:17,529 --> 00:00:27,580
on behalf of Jean weak Rock headmaster

5
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:30,789
of ensimag school who is deeply sorry

6
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:34,239
that he cannot be with us today

7
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:40,829
missing graphic and fortunately he has

8
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:44,110
some appointment in Paris today well on

9
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:46,600
behalf of him so I would like first to

10
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:48,399
thank you and to tell you although he is

11
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,309
very sorry not to be with her

12
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:55,930
he's very happy that once again we can

13
00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:59,108
host graphic here in Grenoble InP

14
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:03,100
handsome Agha and I should say for the

15
00:00:59,109 --> 00:01:06,460
last time in this hall so maybe you

16
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:13,000
might be surprised but at long last we

17
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:16,929
have been able to secure the renewing of

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,540
this old fashioned deliciously old

19
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:22,320
fashioned and vintage lecture hall so

20
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:25,619
next year we should have a brand new

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:29,740
wholesome hoping that you will be able

22
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:33,420
this year to enjoy again this very nice

23
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:36,250
older lecture halls well with some

24
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:39,130
points which are not so pleasant here

25
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:44,200
but still you will see next year what it

26
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:47,919
can be so my I might have a question why

27
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,750
did you come to Grenoble oh so maybe you

28
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,549
wonder why you come to Granada no I

29
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:54,280
think most of you know why you come to

30
00:01:51,549 --> 00:02:00,070
Grenoble and this is because there is a

31
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:03,729
very appealing event grow haka but why

32
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:05,740
is grow Hawking granola the main reason

33
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:08,130
graphic is in Grenoble is because

34
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:14,890
Grenoble has always been a pioneering

35
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:16,569
city in terms of research its second

36
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:20,739
reason in terms of research in

37
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:25,000
cybersecurity it concentrates over 10%

38
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:27,730
of the research workforce of France okay

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,030
now there is a competing city in France

40
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:34,290
in the West in Rennes but Grenoble is

41
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:38,560
still a very important center we have

42
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:43,510
cyber Institute called the cyber at Alps

43
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,780
is that group researchers more than

44
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:50,950
between a hundred and two hundred

45
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:54,400
researchers from mathematics to social

46
00:02:50,950 --> 00:03:03,760
sciences and lo going through computer

47
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:08,110
science and and electronics and so this

48
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,959
is one main reason why Granada has

49
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:13,120
always been involved in cyber security

50
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:18,700
since the beginning of the story

51
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:21,489
actually we started a master in 2001 so

52
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:25,179
18 years ago and there are a number of

53
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:27,220
Master in cyber security our students

54
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:30,700
get acquainted with security from the

55
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:34,299
first year and we have currently four

56
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:39,578
different masters involving cyber

57
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:41,799
security I will just switch to French

58
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:44,380
for the French speaking audience to let

59
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:46,239
you know a bit about what's going on

60
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:49,060
here don't

61
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,700
just promise unique new decree on OTT

62
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:54,940

julius baer on the mill van okay so

78
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:37,379
switching back to english for those who

79
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:40,300
didn't gets a point I may I just mention

80
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:42,870
that the grown-up was a pioneering city

81
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:46,090
in cybersecurity and in many other

82
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:49,029
respect by the way I always tell my

83
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:53,739
students that for those who come from a

84
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:57,249
broader you many people think that the

85
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:59,860
French Revolution started in Paris while

86
00:04:57,249 --> 00:05:01,419
some parents think so but everybody

87
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,479
normally should know that the French

88
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:07,508
Revolution started in 1788 in granola

89
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:10,960
and we have been a pioneering city in

90
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:16,750
all respects okay so to make it short

91
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:20,258
now I would just like to tell you final

92
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:23,199
notes that I'm very happy that this year

93
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:25,569
is the first year where none of my PhD

94
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:29,860
students have been implied in the

95
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:32,500
organization of Grayhawk it was started

96
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,270
by two of my PhD students some time ago

97
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:37,029
one of them had not yet arrived but

98
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:41,409
should be coming soon Carrie Mathison

99
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:44,529
and well now this year is something

100
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:48,339
different so it's very interesting and

101
00:05:44,529 --> 00:05:50,469
I'm quite eager to see what will come of

102
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:51,389
it and even though Anu is not always

103
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:54,370
better

104
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:57,129
renewal is essential and I think Rarick

105
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:59,860
have shown a great potential for renewal

106
00:05:57,129 --> 00:06:02,379
and so once again thank you for

107
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:07,770
attending this event renewing and

108
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:07,770
promoting new ideas and enjoy

109
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,290
[Applause]
