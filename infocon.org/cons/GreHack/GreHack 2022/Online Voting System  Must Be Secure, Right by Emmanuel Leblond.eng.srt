1
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:07,200
uh hi everyone my name is Emmanuel my

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,080
real job is making a cool open source

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,179
and when encrypted data sharing solution

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,380
that is now used by the French

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,179
government I'm really happy about that

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,279
but I'm here to talk to you about

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,800
something today unrelated which is

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,260
online voting and so as you may know

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,779
last year we had the French presidential

10
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:26,880
election and before that there was a

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,539
multiple primary election held by a

12
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,420
political party and the interesting

13
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,640
thing about that is they were all held

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,460
with online voting and they all use the

15
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,320
same software the same solution which is

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,100
nervant so what is neurot

17
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,800
basically it's the leader in online

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,559
voting in France it is used by plenty of

19
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:52,500
different big companies and even Public

20
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,899
University

21
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:58,379
uh and no political Direction but the

22
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,600
bad thing about nevot is it's a total

23
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,760
black box there is absolutely no

24
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,619
information about what they do

25
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:06,540
internally I mean this is from their

26
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,400
website this is the only technical

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,640
technical thing there is so really

28
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,680
really few information about what does

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,680
it do uh so anyway

30
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,900
I wanted to vote for the Green Party

31
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,659
primary election so I won't talk to you

32
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:24,420
about how the website works because I

33
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,299
don't have time anyway at the end when I

34
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,540
finally voted I got the screen and on

35
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,820
the screen there is this weird thing it

36
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,860
looks like uh Exodus code and it's

37
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,299
called the proof of vote so they said

38
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,240
something like a great success you you

39
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,280
have voted everything's fine now you can

40
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,900
take this thing which is your proof of

41
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,780
vote and uh take it don't share it and

42
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,700
you will be able to validate that your

43
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,159
vote is within The Ballot Box later on

44
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,680
so I contacted neovad to have more

45
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,240
information about that they were really

46
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,100
kind to answer me and they said yeah

47
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,680
don't worry uh today the the result of

48
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,479
the election will be available you will

49
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:07,380
be able to check this so fair enough uh

50
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,139
the day of the result of the election

51
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,379
so we can see a unique Shadow wall and

52
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:15,959
as I said here they provide you a

53
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:17,220
website

54
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,980
a website here and a password and so

55
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,260
they say go to this website so here is

56
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,360
the website you go to the website you

57
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,900
enter the address of the CR value the

58
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,500
password you proof a vote and then it

59
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,200
crashed

60
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,500
so yeah I single-handedly videos the

61
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,700
thing

62
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,459
so but it's okay it's okay because the

63
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,620
the thing about it maybe I don't know

64
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,720
because there is a cache system so if

65
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,819
you retry enough time after something

66
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:51,120
like 20 30 minutes you finally got the

67
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,160
result and so they said okay your vote

68
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,200
is valid everything's fine here is the

69
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,500
result okay so far so good uh but there

70
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,040
is this thing

71
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:04,680
yeah so it's pretty cool though I mean

72
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,319
they said okay uh if you don't have time

73
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,060
you can use this website if you don't

74
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,159
want to trust and you should not trust

75
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,840
of course then you can download the

76
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,400
source code so I downloaded the source

77
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,879
code uh spoiler alert since I provided

78
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,159
my input and provided my funding they'll

79
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,340
remove the possibility to download

80
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,360
foreign

81
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,940
so whatever there is this transparency

82
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,120
script which is a PHP script I don't

83
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,000
have time to uh to talk too much about

84
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,060
it but as a Computing engineer I have

85
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,900
nightmare about this code uh whatever so

86
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,080
basically what this script does in to

87
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,599
download two archives from the website

88
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,260
to volume then it will check that your

89
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,700
proof about contains the right thing

90
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,040
compared to the archive and then do a

91
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,080
redo Ballot Box Counting

92
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,560
uh so we can have a look at the proof of

93
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,140
world format so as you can see it's kind

94
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,739
of base64 uh if you remove the base64

95
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:08,519
inside it's AES encrypted

96
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,640
with an alcoholic key

97
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,879
oh so of course I asked near what about

98
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,139
this and they say no no it's fine

99
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,418
everything's fine don't worry uh this is

100
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:20,820
not for encryption purpose it's work

101
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,620
padding

102
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,960
so why not choose a real padding

103
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,080
algorithm what for because the input

104
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,000
data are always the same size so I don't

105
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,680
understand why they do this but there is

106
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,000
no documentation so you don't know about

107
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,520
it whatever uh

108
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,639
by the way uh there is a bug here in the

109
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,820
code so just to use this as is and they

110
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,600
should have converted to a binary before

111
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,919
that's a small thing but it shows you

112
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,979
that weak typing is a bad thing anyway

113
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:52,380
so the inside of the proof of vote as

114
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,940
you can see there is a header there is

115
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,500
some random bytes and there is five

116
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,720
hashes so the idea is one Ash is

117
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,940
correspond to one vote and you have

118
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,560
multiple ashes so that your proof of

119
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,680
vote cannot show which for who you voted

120
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,400
for

121
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,100
uh okay fine the bad thing is there is

122
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,900
no cryptographic signature which means

123
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,660
we can write a simple python script and

124
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,180
generate a fake proof of both and if we

125
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,740
generate a fake proper code what

126
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,440
happened uh the website say something

127
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,900
wrong occurs may I say that's normal

128
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,639
it's a paper robot but what does it

129
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,100
means is if you have a fake proof about

130
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,139
an engineered ballot you get this result

131
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:31,860
if you have a genuine proof about and

132
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,139
someone has tempered the mailbox you get

133
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,120
the same results

134
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,460
and it's totally the same you you cannot

135
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,500
say which one is which one so what does

136
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,500
it mean is uh if there is an election

137
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,240
with neobot you can create a fake proof

138
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,919
about and say something went wrong the

139
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:49,620
election is rigged and if you are not an

140
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,300
attacker if you are a regular person

141
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,699
let's say oh my proof my junior profile

142
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:55,919
doesn't work they can go to you and say

143
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,900
you are an attacker you created a fake

144
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,320
proper vote and you're lying so proof of

145
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,639
vote

146
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,460
uh now let's see The Ballot Box format

147
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,979
so as I said the valid box is divided

148
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:11,580
into two archive the first one is called

149
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,520
not key it contains only a

150
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,880
RSA your key uh the same PM but it's not

151
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,360
PM whatever and the second one which is

152
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,580
much more interesting contained much

153
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,620
more thing it's a balance box and first

154
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,020
there is some metadata not really

155
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,360
interesting then you have a two-folder

156
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,819
one per turn in the election and inside

157
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:35,520
sorry inside those folder you have three

158
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,440
files so we are going to see what they

159
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,020
contain the first one object name it

160
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,759
contains a reference between the name of

161
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,400
the candidate and an ID the second one

162
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,560
not really interesting configuration I'm

163
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,419
pretty sure we can high click this but I

164
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:49,860
didn't play enough long enough to do

165
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,840
that

166
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,340
and the last one which is by far the

167
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,340
bigger one ballot data which contain one

168
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,960
line pervert so it contains all the

169
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,080
votes for the election uh so and sorry

170
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,319
if you have a look at this thing uh you

171
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,560
can see that the first part

172
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,440
the second part sorry is the shaft 512

173
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,539
of the first part so this is the second

174
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:15,360
part is what's inside your proof of Bolt

175
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,600
uh for the first part once you decorate

176
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,560
it inside with RSA you got this so this

177
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,160
part is random random I don't have time

178
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,000
but

179
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,639
and the first thing is of course the

180
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:32,340
idea of the candidate you voted for

181
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,060
okay so now it's time to have some fun

182
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,300
um so what we've seen is the value box

183
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,139
is not signed so we can modify it and

184
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:45,840
everything's fine uh we have the very

185
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,520
same key we have all the ashes we have

186
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,259
all the data we can do basically

187
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:52,740
whatever we want so for instance one

188
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,680
attack we can do is just changing this

189
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,680
file I mean for instance this ballot is

190
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,440
the guy bought it for Unique Shadow but

191
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,780
if we change this now we have got it for

192
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,039
something also

193
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,460
I mean simple

194
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,440
and so if we do that we regenerate The

195
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,780
Ballot Box we hosted it on our own

196
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,240
server and then we use the official

197
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,759
website to do the check and everything

198
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,720
works the the proof of both is happy and

199
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,699
as you can see now we have a summary

200
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:26,099
also we have one and so we'll adjust the

201
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:28,860
switch the the candidates so that's the

202
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,199
first incredibly simple attack I mean

203
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,539
you really need a notepad

204
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:36,059
7-Zip I mean you don't need to be

205
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,219
technical nothing and you can just do

206
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:39,140
that

207
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,740
people will use the proof about

208
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,360
won't be able to see there's something

209
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,540
wrong occurred but for the organizer I

210
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,339
guess it's pretty visible because it

211
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:52,320
seems like the right thing to do that

212
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,180
before the election you say okay this ID

213
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,740
corresponds to this candidate and we

214
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,399
will check this afterwards so you can

215
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,800
find better attack

216
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,360
I said we have the racing key the

217
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,459
private key and with the private key you

218
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:08,040
can retrieve the public key and with the

219
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,080
public key you can do encryption and so

220
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,300
you can generate new votes

221
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:17,100
so we can do the old way of adding new

222
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,320
vote inside The Ballot Box

223
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,080
so really simple we generate a new vote

224
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,779
we encrypt them we add them to the

225
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:28,320
ballot file and that's it so it still

226
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,100
works the attack is a bit less elegant

227
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,399
because now we have the wrong number of

228
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,320
voter of course because we have added

229
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,839
votes

230
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,140
but it's more complicated so it's really

231
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,420
visible to the to the organizer still

232
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,420
but for the people who use the proofabot

233
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,820
to verify they can see thing

234
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,640
so now we have the third one and there

235
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,200
is this file maybe you you've seen I

236
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,899
didn't talk about because uh it's uh the

237
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:00,540
funny file so this file contained a list

238
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,860
of hashes

239
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,440
that you have to email

240
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,540
so is that great because what does it

241
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,180
mean is you can generate all the fake

242
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,700
votes we need then we add them to the

243
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,959
balance data and then we remove somewhat

244
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:18,060
to have the right number of votes and

245
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,700
those removed what we take the ashes and

246
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,399
we put them into extra sheet.cc

247
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:26,100
and once we've done that everything's

248
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,560
fine so we have the right number of

249
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,140
ballots everything is valid all the

250
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,399
proof of vote uh okay and uh now we have

251
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:38,040
somebody also with our wound with two

252
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,440
robots then the unique shadow

253
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,600
right

254
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,820
so yeah it's totally invisible to the

255
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,000
voters uh it's totally invisible to the

256
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,480
organizer too and the only thing is the

257
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,180
file extraction.csv it used to have only

258
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,940
24 hashes and now it has like something

259
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,320
like 3000 but I mean it used to be 24 93

260
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,100
000 y24 B4 one uh three thousand nobody

261
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,620
knows so seems okay

262
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,320
uh so you may wonder what the awards

263
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,240
said about that because of course I send

264
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,740
them all of data and they say it's

265
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,480
really misleading it's a fake attack

266
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,839
it's not something which is a a real

267
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,720
attack because the only source of trust

268
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,300
is The Ballot Box that is inside the

269
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,640
note server so I modified locally my

270
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,860
Ballot Box but it's not genuine it's not

271
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,440
a real attack because you have to modify

272
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,360
the server one

273
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,519
uh so basically what this what does it

274
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,220
mean is as long as you trust newbot for

275
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,040
hosting the right Ballot Box then you

276
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,220
can use the validation tool to validate

277
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,579
then neovit hasn't made something wrong

278
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:49,700
okay

279
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,980
uh so here is a little list of

280
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,800
everything wrong that occur uh how much

281
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,140
time do I set up

282
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,700
15.

283
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:04,260
I was as fast I have plenty of bonus

284
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,200
sorry

285
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,959
yeah yeah because

286
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,820
my conference was originally 45 minute

287
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,140
long so I say okay I have to cut things

288
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,820
so maybe I should have user okay anyway

289
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,040
I have plenty of time I can speak of

290
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,720
plenty of stuff I have bonuses don't

291
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,760
worry uh so

292
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,339
we are going to just

293
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:29,940
we'll see this later uh you can try all

294
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,980
this is the thing yourself if you want

295
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:36,180
for instance if you happen to is to be

296
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,220
in this company or in public university

297
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,160
that's usually Awards you can get in

298
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,660
touch with me you can use my GitHub my

299
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,459
GitHub repo where there is all the

300
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:49,200
script to modify The Ballot Box to

301
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,320
create the fake proof of Worlds so uh if

302
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,120
in the next election we have plenty of

303
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,000
uh wrong I mean

304
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,459
proof of votes that doesn't add up who

305
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:00,560
knows

306
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,600
okay and so

307
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,839
yeah I start this thing uh alone but

308
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:09,180
quickly enough I was joined by people

309
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,480
from the cnrs

310
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,500
researcher which is called encapable

311
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,980
shop great people and so uh she does a

312
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,760
really great job at making this more

313
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,980
scientific Centric

314
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,200
and so we published a paper with this so

315
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,060
this is the first paper he published in

316
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,160
French

317
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,839
they tried to sue us and they try to sue

318
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:34,320
the cnrs and the CCSD it didn't win very

319
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,639
far but

320
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:37,920
and the second one was the ego trading

321
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,060
this summer uh they got a price based

322
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,600
paper so great this is a paper I mean if

323
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,040
you're interested in this and you want

324
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,380
something which is more academic you

325
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,139
really should check this paper

326
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:54,720
uh so I supposed to finish but I have

327
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,220
plenty of time so I will switch to the

328
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,519
bonus

329
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,560
I didn't talk about the website the

330
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,860
newbot website so here is it is a

331
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,680
website I mean it's regular website

332
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,820
JavaScript HTML you know so if I remove

333
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,519
the amplifying the refining we can see

334
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:17,459
here with some indents we can see the

335
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:19,500
name of the variable are all changed

336
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,779
with gibberish so we cannot do much more

337
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:24,480
but there is some variable which are not

338
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,000
because there are closures

339
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,820
so the name matter in the code and what

340
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,920
we can do with this is we can search on

341
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,540
GitHub

342
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,560
and so if we do that we see there is a

343
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,139
one Library which is named ESN crypto

344
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:42,600
which user's name uh the sad news about

345
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,839
async crypto sorry if we check the code

346
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,600
so here you see nearby the website here

347
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,399
you see the ASM crypto you see it's

348
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,339
really really similar so they must be

349
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:56,639
using this crypto library and okay so

350
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,620
now this crypto Library

351
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,920
is basically a one-man job uh it has not

352
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,380
been updated in two years there is of

353
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:08,100
course no security audit so yeah not the

354
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,019
best cryptographic library to do

355
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:12,300
something like online voting

356
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,760
but there is something that doesn't add

357
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,880
up is they use one specific algorithm

358
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,800
which is a RSA or pkcs whatever and this

359
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,899
thing is not implemented inside ASM

360
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:27,199
crypto

361
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,540
but there is a pull request an open pull

362
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,399
request that implement this

363
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,199
and of course they use it

364
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,680
bleeding edge

365
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:45,120
uh so let's have a another little fun

366
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,880
thing you know The Ballot Box the

367
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,760
archives they are password protected

368
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,820
but I couldn't open the archive on

369
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,120
Windows I mean the

370
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,800
ballot key I couldn't open it on the

371
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,620
Windows wrong password and the other

372
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,420
archive product box I couldn't open it

373
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,399
on Linux one password

374
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,540
so hmm

375
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:12,319
anyone has any guess

376
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:16,279
you want to eat oh

377
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:27,959
yeah you're right because uh the the zip

378
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:32,040
format doesn't do uh doesn't use Unicode

379
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,279
for the password it use bytes so it's up

380
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,680
to the operating system to choose which

381
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,420
encoding use

382
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,240
and so yeah using accent there is not

383
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,680
the great ID but you I'm sure you wonder

384
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,459
uh in the PHP script they must open this

385
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:53,100
archive so how do they do

386
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,800
this is a code

387
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,839
uh and you can see that they just try

388
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,480
they try as is then they do a utfa to

389
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,179
ISO and then either to Infinity rate

390
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:08,160
I mean they could choose they could

391
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,199
choose one encoding they could choose

392
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:13,679
not to use uh Unicode they could choose

393
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,939
whatever and they choose this

394
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,020
[Music]

395
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:25,559
oh yeah great uh so I was talking to you

396
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:27,240
about uh

397
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,580
the vote and this part of the vote which

398
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:33,960
was random uh so uh if I had a look

399
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,960
inside the website and I saw the place

400
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,580
where this thing is is done so it's

401
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,640
really random stuff but they just they

402
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,740
don't just take the random billion bytes

403
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,780
and put them here they do some stuff

404
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,080
because you see this is uh

405
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,020
this is uh I say this is a printable

406
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,220
characters

407
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,500
so

408
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,980
this thing is bytes basically

409
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,520
so we see it as only printable

410
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,919
characters but they should be able to

411
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:07,020
have non-printable

412
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,179
but this thing is only a printable

413
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:13,620
character so what does it mean is

414
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,840
sorry I will switch this and we'll see

415
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,380
it later what does it mean is basically

416
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,960
the randomness of the bytes I provide is

417
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,460
really narrow

418
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,820
and there is funny thing is it's not

419
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,100
even equally

420
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,460
it's not even equally distributed so uh

421
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,240
the algorithms I use to to take real

422
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,400
random bites and turn them into their

423
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,799
less random bites is this one which is

424
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,620
funny because they do already 25 instead

425
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,419
of module 26

426
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:48,299
I don't know why and yeah the funny part

427
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:50,160
is this thing

428
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,760
is then encrypted into RSA

429
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,620
and so uh RSA and pkcs uh this this

430
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,740
algorithm uh it works like this you have

431
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,539
a header then you have random device

432
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:06,840
real random lights and then you have uh

433
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,360
the zero and then your message

434
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,679
uh you watch user 3072 bytes along your

435
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,440
key so that's why and so the funny thing

436
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,440
is this is real cryptographically sexual

437
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,559
bytes and this is a message and so

438
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,559
they try to put as much less

439
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,720
cryptographically secure bytes as they

440
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,600
can to replace a secure one

441
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,520
so I I have the feeling that they didn't

442
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,280
quite re-read this thing and realized

443
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,320
that they could just take this you know

444
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,940
this and this will be filled with

445
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,860
correct bytes

446
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,340
yeah you should read the spec the good

447
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,160
thing is uh pkcs is well done so there

448
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,299
is at least

449
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:50,100
uh I don't even know something like yeah

450
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,740
eight bytes which are always random so

451
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,320
it's not a security issue but it would

452
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,660
have been if if not the people were

453
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,880
behind because yes so I've thought this

454
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,780
well uh and the final bonus

455
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,059
Heron Ling I told you about the PHP

456
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:09,299
script that caused me some nightmare uh

457
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:13,140
sorry so this code is um is copyrighted

458
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,059
it's not open source so I cannot show a

459
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:18,059
full but I can just choose one example

460
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:20,880
and just try to make the most of it so I

461
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,280
choose this example you can see there is

462
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,799
this ballot counting so okay the thing

463
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:27,600
does ballot counting and if something

464
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,240
goes wrong there is this critical column

465
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,140
so now written code if it's 98 it means

466
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,720
that it's timeout so timeout means we

467
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,720
have to store the data on disk so okay

468
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,940
let's know that it may fail so if it

469
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,640
fail then you have error code that is

470
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,860
one and error point which is 4D plus red

471
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,760
code divided by 1000 and if the red card

472
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,940
is two three five six but not four then

473
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,100
error code is 6 and error point is 48

474
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,980
plus return code divided by 1000.

475
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,740
and you break to which PHP instruction

476
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,860
means that you return from two loops

477
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,600
yeah

478
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,039
pretty cool

479
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:10,559
so anyway I think I'm

480
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,580
thinking you can go to

481
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:19,260
so here is the list of stuff

482
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,400
that's

483
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,580
are not that great uh and basically I'm

484
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,820
done

485
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,240
okay so thank you we can Applause

486
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,440

foreign

488
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,940
do you have any questions

489
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,960
there is some question here

490
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,460
just return the mic please

492
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,900
hello

493
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,659
thanks for your presentation uh did you

494
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,880
get the opportunity to look at the

495
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,400
system that which was used for the last

496
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,620
legislative election in France that used

497
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,179
a different software from a different

498
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:20,820
company no a little I already have a

499
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,640
look at this okay

500
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,520
so

501
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,120
I don't think it's this bad in official

502
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,520
elections but we if you want to to look

503
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,620
at it

504
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:37,980
this year the cinemas yeah I think that

505
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,380
I started looking at it

506
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,250
there are not a question on the top

507
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:47,460
[Music]

508
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,100
um hello if we were to ask you privately

509
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,780
could you give your PHP code thank you

510
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:57,610
I guess we can we can talk cool

511
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:00,629
[Music]

512
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:02,780
thank you for your presentation

513
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:06,960
terrifying and you talked about some

514
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,799
hashes that were kind of Shadow banned

515
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,179
yeah

516
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:16,260
um and so you added some some hashes to

517
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,940
see if they were shut up and but have

518
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,539
you tried to remove the 24

519
00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:24,120
hashes and see what happens the thing is

520
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,360
if you remove the 24 ashes everything

521
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,320
goes fine except for some people which

522
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,840
have a proof of what which contain those

523
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,960
ashes my guess because it's only I guess

524
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,880
as I said there's no documentation is

525
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,340
when the server starts there is

526
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,320
absolutely no action of course and the

527
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,880
first person has to vote

528
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,340
so it provides both he has only one

529
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,100
action and so we have to give him four

530
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,940
more ashes which are those and so 24

531
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,799
actually I guess it's because they have

532
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:57,059
six server

533
00:23:57,059 --> 00:23:59,700
great thank you very much

534
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,179
we have time for extra questions

535
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:06,200
so in the middle

536
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,240
and

537
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,919
okay perfect

538
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,220
oh hey awesome thought man

539
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,039
um does the source code leak or release

540
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:22,580
contains only verification and

541
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,740
Standalone or is this back-end stuff

542
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,980
you mean the PHP script yep uh it's just

543
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:32,760
a one single file for a single name okay

544
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,700
okay I think it's the most simple but

545
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,659
it's just a

546
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:39,860
yeah not really complicated

547
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,280
[Music]

548
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:48,360
please right now yes perfect

549
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,640
hello uh where you were approached

550
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,220
either by nail Vote or any more serious

551
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:58,039
uh developers or

552
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:00,539
companies that would like to develop

553
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:03,050
something more serious so

554
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:05,640
[Music]

555
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,420
the very first

556
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,179
[Music]

557
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:11,640
pencils only is provide them to me a lot

558
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,520
so yeah something might be broken I want

559
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,760
to write an article about this

560
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,799
we won't say something about that we

561
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:22,860
want to fix before it is and basically

562
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,080
they got really angry and they said that

563
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,820
everything I do is a basic fake and so

564
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,659
it's not real issues I'm showing

565
00:25:32,659 --> 00:25:36,200
so I can do much more with a new world

566
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,580
this written legal action against

567
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,340
against me against this universe the

568
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,980
connection organization rest

569
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:47,700
so yes and it's it's got something uh

570
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,720
and now for doing better online learning

571
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,419
uh yeah there is people which are doing

572
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:57,120
research in online buildings I'm not an

573
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,120
expert ongoing but no I've talked to a

574
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,520
good number of people who do online

575
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,279
voting as a researcher and basically

576
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,100
what I understand is doing online

577
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,260
boarding is a

578
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,440
it just doesn't work so basically you

579
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,720
want to have a physical proof of your

580
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,559
vote and when you at the moment use a

581
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:21,240
computer the physical proof of your vote

582
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,940
is basically you type in on a keyboard

583
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,400
and everything that goes after that it's

584
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,400
uh is into the void and you cannot do

585
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,900
any Trust

586
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,539
thanks I was afraid you would answer

587
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:37,340
that for the first part of your answer

588
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,520
[Music]

589
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,380
hello great presentation based on the

590
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,779
answer you provided just right now that

591
00:26:57,779 --> 00:26:59,940
it touches like on culture it also

592
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,340
touches on the way that these kind of

593
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,919
companies approach researchers like you

594
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:06,679
that I understand you are independent

595
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:10,320
what's the ideal strategy in your

596
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,840
opinion if we are having elections like

597
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,659
for example four months from now to

598
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:18,720
approach this tasks of securing the

599
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,120
software if you I mean for me it's about

600
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,580
some trade-offs if you choose to open it

601
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,860
to everybody you may have some countries

602
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:29,220
interested in messing up with that

603
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,880
uh people might be like oh everybody is

604
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,620
messing up with the software if you

605
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,659
don't have it open you run into the

606
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:38,400
problem that just a little group of

607
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,320
people is seeing the source code uh

608
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,659
what's your opinion

609
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:45,480
uh I'm not a researcher in this field of

610
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,260
area so uh I don't feel like my opinion

611
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,020
has a lot of value on this I'm just a

612
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,559
very wrong people so I think if you want

613
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:57,779
a better answer you should ask the

614
00:27:57,779 --> 00:27:59,220
people at CLS

615
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:03,620
because there's a real person doing this

616
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,779
one final question

617
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:11,400
okay

618
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,779
thank you

619
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:15,419
um I'm checking this website now

620
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:18,900
and they claim to have homologation from

621
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:22,799
everyone like Neil and C including dgsi

622
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,159
uh Etc where where is it where is the

623
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,820
amargulation uh can can we connect to

624
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,200
those

625
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,419
the agencies and see what's going on

626
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:37,500
funny thing is most of the accreditation

627
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,320
they have from a organization those

628
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,600
organizations don't give accreditation

629
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,000
so basically they said oh we've done an

630
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,460
election with this fancy thing so we got

631
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,240
accreditation

632
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,039
yeah

633
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,600
yeah and if you want to if you're on the

634
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,279
website at the bottom of the website

635
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:58,039
there is a link which is available

636
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:00,360
accessor something like that if you

637
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,919
click there there is a list of web

638
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,380
server and they are all their web server

639
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,200
and so if you click randomly most of

640
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,380
them are not uh are not online but some

641
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,960
of them are and there are real clients

642
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,720
that are doing a real election so you

643
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,419
can write a simple Sprint and just see

644
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:20,279
in real time all the apparents and what

645
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:21,779
they are doing

646
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:23,120
equation

647
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,039
so thank you again we can we can thank

648
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:28,340
again
