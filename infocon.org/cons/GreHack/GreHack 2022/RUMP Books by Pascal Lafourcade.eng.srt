1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,480
so hello again uh so I will be the last

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,679
of the ramp by chance I don't know

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,519
so this is a 10th anniversary of gorak

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,440
and so when I I Was preparing the the

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,460
rampa I I got an ID so I put all the

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,619
logo of the gorak Edition so you can see

7
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:25,740
from the bottom it was gray white and

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,880
you get colors and for 2022 we we got a

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,880
80 bit Edition so it was a special logo

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,880
design and until the anniversary logo

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,260
here

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,440
so I wanted to make a quiz to know who

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,960
recall which logo is we but I didn't

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,940
have time to to do it

15
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,820
before the ramp and so what I I realized

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,219
is that I wrote some book and this is a

17
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,140
book I wrote each year so it's the same

18
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,579
logo

19
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,379
you have several books so one is about

20
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,300
blockchain one is about civil security

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,460
one is about the architecture of

22
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,140
security for internet

23
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,359
once the black one might interest in you

24
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,140
you have some flyer down there is about

25
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,600
ludic way to learn cryptography through

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,479

27
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,260

28
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,960
