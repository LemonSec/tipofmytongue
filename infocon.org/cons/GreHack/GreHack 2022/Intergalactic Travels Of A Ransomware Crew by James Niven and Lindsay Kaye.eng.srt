1
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:05,700
awesome thank you so much so hi

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,960
everybody thank you so much for coming

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,099
today today we're going to tell you a

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:09,300
little bit about the evolution of a

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,219
ransomware group from Darkseid to black

6
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:12,900
matter to Alpha

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,000
so I'm Lindsay K I'm senior director of

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,260
the advanced reversing malware

9
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,640
operations Eric Constance group The

10
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,020
Record future

11
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,340
um by trading my malware analyst or

12
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,980
reverse engineer hi I'm James Niven also

13
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,119
with the recorded future and I'm a

14
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:25,859
principal threat researcher and prior to

15
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,359
threat intelligence I was a red teamer

16
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,699
for offensive security and crowdstrike

17
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,500
So today we're going to discuss a

18
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,480
ransomware group and how they Rebrand

19
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,820
and change throughout their entire

20
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,620
history whether it be from law

21
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,160
enforcement pressure internal Fallout or

22
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,960
technical flaws in their lockers or

23
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,180
malware campaign along the way we'll see

24
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,520
how they can be tracked and what they

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,200
modify today we're going to be

26
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,879
discussing specifically darkseid's

27
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,920
transition to black matter and then a

28
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,620
more currently Alpha

29
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,360
so discovery of black matter well we

30
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,860
were in the right place of the right

31
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,739
time to kind of find them so dark sided

32
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,080
attacked Colonial pipeline in May May 6

33
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,600
2021 caused a lot of problems in the U.S

34
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,180
gas stations were shut down people were

35
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,460
trying to get gas

36
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,740
they had decryption issues uh earlier in

37
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,360
their Campaign which you could see on

38
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,979
the screenshot on the right uh

39
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:18,960
bitdefender found a decryption flaw in

40
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,420
their locker so dark side Isle of the

41
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,640
picture for now and there's only really

42
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,340
one Locker that has an esxi Locker

43
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,040
available and that's Revo so Revel takes

44
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,080
on most of their Affiliates and most of

45
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,939
the people associated with Darkseid at

46
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,640
the time so Revo had a similar downfall

47
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,400
where they attacked a Brazilian company

48
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,799
but has a large presence the U.S JBS

49
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,840
food groups and that caused a lot of

50
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,759
attention and eventually led to their

51
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,100
downfall as well so with Regal and dark

52
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,020
side out of the picture there was no

53
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,780
good Linux and esxi Locker for the

54
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,960
ransomware community to to have

55
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,960
so this is a screenshot from exploit and

56
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,540
exploit is a is one of the two primary

57
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,579
fun or primary forums where ransomware

58
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:05,520
operators and and uh malicious actors

59
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,799
will communicate is largely Russia it's

60
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,660
primarily russian-based there's English

61
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,879
speakers on there as well and on this

62
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,739
forum is where a lot of the negotiations

63
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:16,379
of uh selling tools buying things

64
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,959
joining programs goes and after the

65
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,940
Forum the initial communication on the

66
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,379
Forum it'll go through secondary

67
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:25,140
platforms such as telegram jabber talks

68
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,000
and other ways that they will

69
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
communicate so an interesting thing

70
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,260
about this screenshot is you can see

71
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,440
it's only one post from this actor the

72
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,160
way to mitigate or way to uh prove you

73
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,540
have reputation and you're actually in

74
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,879
this game is either reputation or your

75
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,140
Bitcoin deposit they've got a four

76
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,720
Bitcoin deposit with one post so he's

77
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,180
saying I'm serious and what he's asking

78
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,280
for are essentially

79
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,800
um Network accesses so your initial

80
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,440
access is whether it be vpns or RDP or

81
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,019
or any slew of those and he doesn't

82
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:00,000
actually say that they are talking about

83
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,860
ransomware or wanting you to join a

84
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,420
ransomware group because after the

85
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,800
attacks we talked about previously

86
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,819
darkseid's uh Colonial pipeline attack

87
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:10,440
ransomware or foreign administrators

88
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,319
really kind of clamp down on the use of

89
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,780
the word ransomware or any kind of

90
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,180
direct association with it on the forums

91
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,379
and fear that they would get shut down

92
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:20,940
as well

93
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,800
so once you get into the black matter

94
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,480
program this is the first thing you see

95
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,400
as an affiliate and it essentially

96
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,620
highlights the the goods and the the

97
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,540
goods of the program so in this

98
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,459
screenshot you can see they took a

99
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:35,580
notice from rivo Dark Side lockpit took

100
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,319
the best features of those improved on

101
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,120
it they're saying that they tested their

102
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,980
panel for all your web vulnerabilities

103
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,620
they tested their decrypter or so they

104
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,700
think

105
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,500
um they tested on the different versions

106
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,640
of Windows Linux es6i Nas

107
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,220
um later on different different os's

108
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,440
and it's essentially the saying this is

109
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,480
why you chose our program

110
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,159
so on the left you can see the

111
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,440
screenshot of darkseid's panel this and

112
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,060
on the right is black matter and this

113
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,099
panel is kind of the home home page for

114
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:07,260
a ransomware operator there's a lot of

115
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,940
places you can navigate from this panel

116
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,220
but the some of the most interesting

117
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,319
ones are you can go talk to the victim

118
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,079
directly you can change prices in

119
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,120
Bitcoin or enable Monero you can

120
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,500
send notes to an administrator of the

121
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,020
ransomware group to say I don't want to

122
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,759
talk to this victim or I need extra help

123
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:29,100
to talk to this victim and a multitude

124
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,840
of other things and the most interesting

125
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,419
one I think everyone's interested is in

126
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,759
the ability to build the malware itself

127
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,979
in the top middle screenshot or the

128
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,139
screenshot you can see the ability to

129
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:45,180
generate exe elf uh Powershell and and

130
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,340
other builds of the ransomware and with

131
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,840
that I'll hand it over to Lindsay to

132
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,340
kind of go into the malware itself

133
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,620
awesome thank you James so at the outset

134
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,620
of our work on this we got access to two

135
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,840
variants so one for Windows and one

136
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,780
targeting Linux and esxi you can see an

137
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,520
example of the windows Ransom note on

138
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,780
the top right just to give you an idea

139
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,820
what that looks like so the windows

140
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,740
ransomware actually had several

141
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,900
different anti-reverse engineering and

142
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,820
anti-analysis capabilities so nothing

143
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,620
you know wildly insurmountable but

144
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,900
definitely more than nothing

145
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,580
comparatively the Linux and es6i1 was

146
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,960
substantially more straightforward to

147
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,780
reverse engineer so it included things

148
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,280
like function names which you can see a

149
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,600
couple of examples so those of you who

150
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,820
do reverse engineering this is like gold

151
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,860
right so you can see all the function

152
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,360
names kind of what everything does makes

153
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,419
it extremely easy and it contained the

154
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,280
configuration file with a bunch of

155
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,720
information about like configuration

156
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,820
values of malware in a DI obfuscated

157
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,880
format which also much easier

158
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,280
so a couple of these techniques however

159
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,380
actually made the malware somewhat more

160
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,940
signature and easy to track which if

161
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,560
you're a threat researcher this is also

162
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,199
great so the cryptographic routines that

163
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,240
they use to actually encrypt the

164
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,400
victim's files we'll talk a little bit

165
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,720
more about those later but the

166
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,240
combination was somewhat unique

167
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,160
um the string obfuscation mechanism so

168
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,440
generally ransomware will have encrypted

169
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,539
or obfuscated strings in some way and

170
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:08,220
generally what you see is that the

171
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,080
mechanism that they use is fairly unique

172
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,180
to the family or variant

173
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,220
um black matter was no exception it was

174
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,539
extremely simple so you can see an

175
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:18,419
example of this kind of first round of

176
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,120
the string obfuscation magnet I guess

177
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,740
the obfuscation function in the top

178
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,360
right we'll dive more into that key

179
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,539
initialization function soon

180
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:28,080
additionally the function call

181
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,520
obfuscation so this wasn't something

182
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,620
that I had seen before

183
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,479
um so a normal function call you can see

184
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:36,000
on the bottom but what black matter did

185
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,620
was they made static reverse engineering

186
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,419
a little bit more complicated so instead

187
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,220
of just kind of doing a call directly to

188
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,319
the address what they did was they took

189
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,380
a magic number so 22065 fed and then

190
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,819
export it with another value and then

191
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:49,860
would jump to that address so when

192
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,180
you're statically reverse engineering it

193
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,139
you kind of have to figure out like okay

194
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:53,400
where in memory is everything which

195
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,319
makes it a little bit slower

196
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:58,500
um Dynamic much easier

197
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,419
um and kind of on this subject are the

198
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,759
magic numbers so each build had its own

199
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:05,100
magic number in this first build it was

200
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,860
22065 fed and it made several different

201
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,500
appearances throughout the code

202
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,960
so we released a report containing a

203
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,060
string decrypter and sumiara rules for

204
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,160
both versions and then magically new

205
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,539
versions of the ransomware started

206
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,639
appearing specifically the windows

207
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,039
ransomware so some of them had very

208
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,960
simple changes so that magic X or k

209
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,000
varied per build and then others had

210
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,639
very substantially more complex features

211
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:32,039
so things like new features and other

212
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:34,139
changes we'll talk about so you can see

213
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:36,360
an example of that key initialization

214
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,740
function from that first version

215
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,400
numbered 1.2 extremely simple in

216
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,319
subsequent versions they made the string

217
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,419
decryption substantially more

218
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:47,039
complicated so you can see an example of

219
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,319
how that function evolved in subsequent

220
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,300
versions

221
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,500
ultimately during the time that black

222
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,180
matter was active we never did see

223
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,220
another Linux or esxi build not entirely

224
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,960
sure why there you go

225
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,479
and then ultimately over the several

226
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,680
months that they were active they

227
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,660
released six different versions so

228
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,539
numbered between 1.2 and 3.0 of their

229
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:09,960
malware between July and September

230
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,639
so let's talk about a couple of the

231
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:12,960
future editions that we observed during

232
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,900
these summer months so first one of them

233
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,940
is printing the note on Ransom note on

234
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,039
local printers so other than like the

235
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:21,660
entertainment factor of seeing Ransom

236
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,160
note kind of spit out from your office's

237
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,020
printer one of the things that companies

238
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,520
want to do when they get attacked by

239
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,280
ransomware is keep it extremely quiet so

240
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,080
it's much harder to ignore these rants

241
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,059
notes coming out of printers than it is

242
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:34,919
to have you know somebody with you know

243
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,958
a ransom note on their screen so this

244
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,120
draws attention of the employees and I

245
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,679
mean it's also somewhat entertaining for

246
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,020
the actor I'm sure

247
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,979
adding the addition to encrypt

248
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:46,260
additional file types so specifically

249
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,760
some of the Microsoft Exchange files

250
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,920
which we'll look at soon so as you can

251
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,540
imagine attracting Affiliates to the

252
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,399
ransomware program it's a business right

253
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,080
so being able to support as many

254
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,420
different type types of file encrypt as

255
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,820
many things as you can do as much damage

256
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,680
is something that the program wants to

257
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,940
be able to do

258
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,459
next um you can see an example of the

259
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:07,019
Builder on the right so the black matter

260
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:08,940
affiliate panel and what this allows you

261
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,560
to do is when you build a copy of the

262
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,940
ransomware that you will later deploy

263
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,860
you can choose different configuration

264
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,660
values so one of the things that they

265
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,580
added eventually was the ability to

266
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,100
identify specific computers not to

267
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,080
encrypt

268
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,240
then the implementation of their

269
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,220
cryptographic algorithm did evolve over

270
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,540
time so how they were actually

271
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,760
encrypting the files and then the

272
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,200
ability to check for large files and

273
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,959
encrypt them differently so when you

274
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,120
want to encrypt everybody's stuff you

275
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,620
want to do it as fast as possible before

276
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,940
the system administrators and the

277
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,959
Defenders figure out what you're doing

278
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,240
and are able to stop it so as you can

279
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,980
imagine large files take a longer time

280
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,320
to encrypt so what you want to do is be

281
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,420
able to speed that up however you can so

282
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,459
they'll do things like sometimes we see

283
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:53,040
villain encrypt the first I guess couple

284
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,839
megabytes of the file or they'll

285
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:57,779
incrementally encrypt but that is

286
00:09:57,779 --> 00:09:59,220
definitely a feature that they did add

287
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,220
over time oh

288
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,019
so let's look at a couple of some of

289
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:05,279
these features and how they evolved over

290
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,459
time so on the left what you can see is

291
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:10,620
an example of the first version of their

292
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,779
printer function so effectively what it

293
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,580
does is it looks for the printer on the

294
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,700
system and if it is not the PDF virtual

295
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,620
printer it'll print

296
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,740
so over time in starting in version 2.0

297
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,140
and above they added a couple of other

298
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,660
printers to also ignore so other virtual

299
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,920
printers that you may be familiar with

300
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,800
so sharfax filex PS port and Port prompt

301
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,779
and one thing I want to point out is

302
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:36,420
unlike the word PDF and ASCII you're not

303
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,640
seeing any of those file names so

304
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,440
another thing that they did was they

305
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,480
have a fairly custom kind of string

306
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,459
hatching algorithm so

307
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:46,680
effectively what it does is it will take

308
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,420
a hash of the printer that it's looking

309
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,920
at and then compare it to any of those

310
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,140
known hashes and if it's one of those

311
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,500
does not print to it so this was

312
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,180
something that I guess it just makes

313
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,320
reverse engineering a little bit more

314
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,839
complicated nothing is surmountable but

315
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:02,399
um it also is something that we'll talk

316
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,540
a little bit about

317
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,720
um other appearances of it later

318
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,480
so looking at the ability to the add the

319
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,040
exchange files you can see on the left

320
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,740
so here's part of the function where it

321
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,200
looks for and traverses the Microsoft

322
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,779
Exchange file path

323
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,100
um to start finding kind of where all

324
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,740
those files are if they're on the system

325
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,240
and what you might also notice is that

326
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,120
you don't actually see the strings

327
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,800
um you can see I've made a comment of

328
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,420
what they actually are but here's

329
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,459
another appearance of that magical x-ray

330
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:35,399
value so pretty simple like stack string

331
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,740
going on and xor with a magical value

332
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,959
here and then just makes reverse

333
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:41,040
engineering again a little more

334
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,779
complicated

335
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:44,640
um then on the right you can see it also

336
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,459
looking for the large file check so it's

337
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:48,600
looking for a couple different file

338
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,260
extensions so mbb MDF edu and accdb and

339
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,579
then it will handle the encryption of

340
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,620
those files differently

341
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,779
so again here is another appearance of

342
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:00,000
that string hashing algorithm just to

343
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,779
make it more complicated

344
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,700
so some researchers at nzsoft came out

345
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,500
saying that one thing that they've

346
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,240
noticed is that previously a group

347
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,300
called Darkseid had a fairly unique

348
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,519
combination of encryption algorithms for

349
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,740
encrypting files and what they noticed

350
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,940
is that this custom salsa 20 Matrix

351
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,140
was something that previously they had

352
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,300
only seen unique to dark side now is

353
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,459
making an appearance in black matter

354
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:28,620
so let's look at what this looks like so

355
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,300
you can see a couple screenshots of both

356
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,579
of these so on the top you can see the

357
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:34,320
random buffer initialization function

358
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,980
followed by the RSA 1024 encryption that

359
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,019
was used by Darkside and then on the

360
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:41,459
bottom you can see black matters

361
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:43,860
implementation of that same thing so

362
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,000
this is kind of what they were talking

363
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,399
about and then you can see

364
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,620
how they implemented that random buffer

365
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,060
initialization so

366
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,220
I guess effectively they are different

367
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,019
and how they did it but the Salient

368
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:57,180
point is the same so that was kind of

369
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,980
interesting

370
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,800
so MZ soft also found another fun and

371
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,420
exciting feature so remember that James

372
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,220
had noted that Darkseid previously had

373
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,320
decryption issues so one of the things

374
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,480
that they noticed is that for some

375
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,920
versions of the black matter ransomware

376
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,360
there was another decryption issue here

377
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,480
so the issue was that victims did not

378
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,120
have to pay for the key in order to have

379
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,040
their files decrypted so MZ soft in the

380
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,180
background was reaching out to these

381
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,160
victims helping them decrypt their files

382
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,200
so they don't have to pay the ransom

383
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,160
so after some time this came to light

384
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,839
and the threat actor found out and then

385
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:32,760
they fixed that specific issue sometime

386
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,180
around September 21 2021 so can't really

387
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,620
speak to this specific issue with

388
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,540
cryptographic code but you can

389
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,160
definitely see some slight changes in

390
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,720
the key initialization code and some of

391
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,579
the actual crypto code itself over the

392
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:46,680
different versions so

393
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,959
um while it's

394
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,200
well it's not necessarily like I guess

395
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,579
the specific issue is the thing it's

396
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:54,899
kind of interesting to notice that it

397
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:56,760
did evolve over time so you can see a

398
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,279
couple of different examples there

399
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,540
and with that I'm going to hand it over

400
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,980
to James tell you about their downfall

401
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,800
so as we've talked dark side now black

402
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,540
miter have decryption issues with their

403
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,480
locker this specific chat was a large

404
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,579
agricultural firm and if you read the

405
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:13,800
chat I I suggest you do there's some

406
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,540
interesting things there

407
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,720
um you'll there's essentially the sisa

408
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,399
was involved in the background MZ soft

409
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,800
was involved in the background other

410
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,260
firms and everything were there and

411
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,380
after this the the chat kind of went

412
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,260
downhill very fast and there was a bunch

413
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,940
of either security researchers other

414
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,459
actors who know who's who it was but if

415
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:38,339
you had the URL to this chat you could

416
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:40,320
join in the chat and have fun and fun

417
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,720
happened and then after this dark side

418
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,519
or black matter kind of shut this chat

419
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:47,100
down talk to the victim specifically and

420
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,260
said here's the new URL for your chat

421
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,959
and then with that they had to put the

422
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,220
victim had to put in the domain

423
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,560
controller names the domain admins and

424
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,480
chat access codes and we'll discuss the

425
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,980
chat access codes in more detail later

426
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:04,079
so decryption issues chat hijacking

427
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,380
losing millions of dollars by decrypting

428
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,019
behind the scenes with the victims black

429
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:11,820
matter was kind of fed up so they said

430
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,920
we're going to shut it down and they

431
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,300
claimed it was due to law enforcement

432
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,000
pressure and 48 hours after this post

433
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,040
they turned the infrastructure off and

434
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,079
handed out the keys for Affiliates to

435
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,519
give to the victims or do the

436
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,160
negotiations elsewhere

437
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,320
so it sounds like it's over for black

438
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,199
matter not quite one of our colleagues

439
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,180
did an interview with a a new

440
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,760
up-and-coming group called Alpha and in

441
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,959
this part of the interview you'll notice

442
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,839
that Alpha is is answering a question

443
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,060
about the chat hijacking and also the

444
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,339
decryption issues so that's interesting

445
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:45,779
and it's it's wondering why they're

446
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,180
talking about this thing specifically so

447
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,820
Affiliates had moved from black matter

448
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,339
to now Alpha and we'll talk about Alpha

449
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:55,040
here in a few

450
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,380
so if you're trying to go into the alpha

451
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,940
program you essentially would reach out

452
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,920
as we saw earlier that black matter post

453
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,899
on exploit you would do the same thing

454
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:06,620
and they would say here's the rules so

455
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,300
here's what our locker does here's how

456
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,519
much you get paid you can get starting

457
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,500
out eighty percent you do a lot of

458
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,139
victims you get 90 percent and and those

459
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,120
kind of things what our locker has these

460
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,540
exci functionality Nas Synology Linux

461
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,180
windows and each one of these things

462
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,639
they kind of point out a a group that

463
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,380
they're saying what they did better for

464
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,240
and the one on the bottom right is the

465
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,380
one that's kind of we're going to key in

466
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,720
on so they say hello Dark Side about

467
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,699
this and this is essentially saying that

468
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:37,680
people that have access to virustotal

469
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,860
can download the decrypt or download the

470
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,500
the locker as the victim posted run it

471
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,360
and get the ransom note and then jump

472
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,399
into the chat and monitor it and that's

473
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,899
essentially how you would monitor those

474
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:50,399
chats and figure out who the victim was

475
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,199
and that's where the access codes come

476
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:54,019
into play

477
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:58,199
so a way to await black matter and Alpha

478
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:00,360
kind of advertise to different people

479
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,279
how to get into the program where the

480
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,859
program exists is through a jabber

481
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:05,699
service

482
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:07,980
um on exploit and essentially you pay a

483
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,299
few hundred dollars and you can have

484
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:11,640
exploit broadcast this message to every

485
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,740
single user on the server and what this

486
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,179
message says is we have Linux es6i

487
00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:20,880
capabilities we have a talks ID or talk

488
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,160
about the specific percentages your get

489
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,439
and also the jabber ID and the thread

490
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,860
that's kind of for the recruiting thread

491
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,780
so once you get into the alpha program

492
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,000
as you saw previously it's a it's a new

493
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,220
panel this panel will kind of highlight

494
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,780
and regurgitate what I just said about

495
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,520
the the esxi and the the percentages

496
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,160
and what's new about Alpha so with their

497
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,140
decryption issues they kind of said we

498
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,760
are really messing up somewhere and we

499
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,160
think it's our our develop our locker

500
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,380
developers so they scratched them and

501
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,940
they've found somebody else to develop

502
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,679
their locker and they completely rewrote

503
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,419
their Locker in Rust they completely

504
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:00,240
redid their panel and you can see it's

505
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,320
very different visually and they

506
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,059
implemented this access code so the way

507
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:08,940
they did this was essentially there's an

508
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,100
access key that's required to run beside

509
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,260
the locker itself the threat actor will

510
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,500
run the locker.exe and then enter this

511
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,179
access code and this access code

512
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:21,179
generates the correct landing page and

513
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:22,740
you'll see in the top screenshot that's

514
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,000
the note the victim would have and the

515
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,980
bottom screenshot is the the one the

516
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,539
affiliate would have so that he can

517
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:30,740
enter the right code this uh

518
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,820
ransomware group also has better support

519
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,919
so it's quicker to talk to an admin to

520
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:37,740
file bugs or just ask for help for

521
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,320
negotiations has a built-in Bitcoin

522
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,480
mixer and it has a new feature that

523
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,860
Lindsay's going to discuss here in a

524
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,840
second that allows you to obfuscate your

525
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,820
ransomware better

526
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,640
cool so the way that Alpha Morph uh the

527
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,900
service for obvious getting your

528
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,760
ransomware was advertised at the outset

529
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,820
was it helps you evade AV detection so

530
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,340
there really is no great AV for Linux so

531
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,020
I was very curious to see what exactly

532
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,299
this intake and they promised a couple

533
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:05,760
things so obfuscated strings as well as

534
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,160
a lot of garbage code insertion so

535
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,919
looking at the ransomware with the morph

536
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:12,539
obfuscation applied I didn't see any

537
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:15,000
actual string obfuscation but there were

538
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,380
a couple of interesting things that I

539
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,480
noticed in the 64-bit morph obfuscated

540
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,240
samples so previously what they had was

541
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,120
no function names they had removed them

542
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,740
but what it now seemed to have is if

543
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,299
you're familiar with name angling what

544
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,280
appeared to be now name mangled versions

545
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,020
of the original function names versus

546
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,419
the unobfuscated ones with the scrub

547
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:36,240
names so you can see on the right a

548
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,000
couple examples of what these uh name

549
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,860
angle looking function names look like

550
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,660
so you can very clearly see the word

551
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,900
Locker so for the ransomware in these

552
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,480
and in the x86 samples you can see a

553
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,720
couple of these kind of like similar

554
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,340
I guess they mangled versions of the

555
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,520
exported x80 of the exported variable

556
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,960
names so that was particularly

557
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,020
interesting and on the left what you can

558
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,000
see is what it was before the morph

559
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,520
obfuscation happened so does not

560
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,059
entirely sure what the point of that was

561
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:10,679
um but eventually they actually

562
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:12,600
abandoned this so now they only have a

563
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,100
Windows version

564
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,500
speaking of the windows version so as

565
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,539
promised there were actually obfuscated

566
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:21,059
strings now in the windows ransomware it

567
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,039
was extremely simple though it was a

568
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,620
random one bite xor using these randomly

569
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,200
generated functions to decode them so

570
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,700
you can see an example

571
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,240
um on the left of what this looked like

572
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,860
so you can see the obvious created

573
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,480
string and then the obvious the

574
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,400
de-obfuscation function so really the

575
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,440
only Salient point of this function with

576
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,720
the garbage code inserted is the X

577
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,580
worrying of each byte with the value 8

578
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:48,179
and the fact that it's a loop so um just

579
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:50,100
gives you kind of an example of what the

580
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,140
random garbage code insertion looks like

581
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,760
and we'll look at two versions compared

582
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,140
to each other as well

583
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,780
so one thing was that so first of all

584
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,700
these rust builds were extremely big of

585
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,620
the ransomware so they were the

586
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,360
unobfuscated ones are about three Megs

587
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,660
each now with the obfuscation apply

588
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,299
they're about 14. so over four times

589
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:11,760
bigger and the largest increases that we

590
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,799
saw were in the text data and relocation

591
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,120
sections so you can kind of see there

592
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,760
what that looks like

593
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,520
so comparing two versions of morph

594
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,980
obfuscated Windows ransomware you can as

595
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,500
a human very clearly see that these are

596
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,720
the same code

597
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,059
um what the garbage code insertion

598
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:31,799
really does appear to be is a bunch of

599
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:34,860
global values where they do random

600
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,380
mathematical operations on them

601
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,419
um doesn't have any actual effect on how

602
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:41,100
the code functions or really how

603
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,539
anything works but this just kind of

604
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:43,860
gives you an example of what they mean

605
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:48,059
by that garbage code insertion obviously

606
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:49,380
as a human this doesn't really make it

607
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,640
much harder

608
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,799
not really sure how well it really also

609
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,658
helps you evade AV in long term

610
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,980
so the story continues the cat and mouse

611
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,659
game has existed for years and it will

612
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:03,059
continue to exist for forever

613
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:05,100
um this three shot in the top left is

614
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,960
curb Zone security article

615
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,780
um alluding to this specific person on

616
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,360
GitHub being the developer of the new

617
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,940
Russ ransomware the screenshot on the

618
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,700
right is uh FBI and C sub both release

619
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:21,179
iocs and ttps associated with with Alpha

620
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:23,460
and the most interesting one on this

621
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,400
deck is uh the bottom one so this is

622
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,260
from Conti's blog and what they're

623
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,600
saying here is that Conti or the alpha

624
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,820
and lock bit are scammers more or less

625
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,280
and what they mean by that is as we

626
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,720
talked about the ability for an

627
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,220
affiliate to reach out to administrator

628
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,080
or someone else to handle the

629
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,539
negotiation they're saying that as we

630
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:44,520
saw with Regal that the administrators

631
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,500
would take over an Affiliates chat so

632
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,240
essentially if you're the victim and you

633
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,799
wanted to get decrypted you could jump

634
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:52,260
into this chat say I need I want to pay

635
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:55,200
but the administrators of the rats would

636
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,940
take that and move it to another chat so

637
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,400
the affiliate would would not see any

638
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,320
communication while they handled on the

639
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,960
side and got all the money from it so

640
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,940
with that we appreciate you attending

641
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,200
our talk and if there's any questions

642
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,980
Now's the Time

643
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,700
so we got time for a couple of questions

644
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,919
uh I know there are questions on Discord

645
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:25,200
if someone can relate them to me that

646
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,000
would be perfect

647
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,460
at least I I will start with one

648
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,140
question at the beginning of your talk

649
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:35,039
uh you mentioned the colonial pipeline

650
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,700
attack or incident and I think it was in

651
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,880
Europe are not necessarily

652
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,440
aware of that incident or that much

653
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,059
aware would you mind just putting

654
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:46,620
explain it a bit what happened at that

655
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,600
time yeah so it's essentially a large

656
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,520
pipeline that's it runs across America

657
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,700
that handles all the gas and it was

658
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,620
brought to the news and everybody that

659
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,900
saw the the regular everyday news didn't

660
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,159
unders they may not understand what

661
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:00,780
ransomware is but they know that their

662
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,280
their gas could be affected so

663
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,840
essentially everybody went to go get gas

664
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,880
and started filling up plastic bags or

668
