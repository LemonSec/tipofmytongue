1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,720
uh so hello everyone my name is Oscar

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,840
Gomez uh I'm 17 years old I work at

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,900
hexiom I go to school at Ecole de mil

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,120
siso you might know it

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,640
um and I'm an offensive developer so

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,340
here was a little meme for you

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,080
so today I'm going to be talking about

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,400
CTF Cafe which is a platform I developed

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,460
to be able to host ctfs

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,679
and uh oh yeah the reason why I

11
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,660
developed CTF Cafe is because I found

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,719
like a lot of CTF platforms had a lot of

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,500
issues which were reoccurring and just

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,739
annoying to deal with

15
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:46,800
one of those examples is ctfd so maybe

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,719
you guys saw with the midnight CTF

17
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:49,820
lately

18
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,100
ctfd has a repetitive theme which is

19
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,079
annoying it's always great always white

20
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,539
always the same which is why CTF Cafe

21
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,739
has three themes and easy customization

22
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:03,660
ctfd is slow and laggy I mean it uses

23
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,960
Django so it's expected this is why CTF

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,200
Cafe is fast fluid uses node.js which I

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,500
know is not the most liked library but

26
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,360
it's good I mean the framework and it

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,880
uses react just because it can be a

28
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,939
single page website so it's better uh

29
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,280
and then ctfd is very resource intensive

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,619
for example I know someone hosts a CTF

31
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,860
with about 600 participants and he had a

32
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,220
website with 256 gigs of RAM that's just

33
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,220
horrible which is why CTF Cafe is

34
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,280
resource efficient for example I hosted

35
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,799
a CTF not long ago called easy cctf

36
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,420
which had the 1700 registrations and all

37
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,759
I was using was a VPS with 16 gigs of

38
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,460
RAM and it had zero crashes in 24 hours

39
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,280
while I was live bug fixing of course

40
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,579
and yeah one bonus ctfd does have though

41
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,500
is the big Community which I think is

42
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,180
its biggest strength and the reason it

43
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,939
has so many plugins and it's so mature

44
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,340
but I am ambitious to build up a

45
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,479
community

46
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,179
and uh that's it

47
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,560
here are some memes
