00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,179
hi so on a domain you know Enterprise

2
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:11,219
there are a ton of SMB share on their

3
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:12,540
nightmare

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,639
because on it you can share your domain

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,279
in Suite with passwords and uh that's

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,279
lovely for attacker so as Defender we

7
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,380
want to get rid of all of them

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,840
so in Windows it's very easy to share a

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,000
directory just a few clicks you can

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,039
share it and give it access to everyone

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,380
so I can refine all those Network share

12
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,800
First Step would be through Network scan

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,079
so there is enough for this but it

14
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,460
doesn't support smb2 and 3.

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,899
you can script something with SMB client

16
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:48,600
but that's Rusty

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,700
fortunately some someone released a

18
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,660
wonderful power shell script which is a

19
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,340
wonderful it gives you the full residual

20
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,320
of the share token correct so that's

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,739
wonderful

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,640
so fortunately a Windows 7 long log the

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,060
5143 that gives you when and who shared

24
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,000
what and where and how so here uh I

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,880
shared uh share and tutorial domain

26
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,700
admin chair to everyone as a stringing

27
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,400
in red on a machine a random machines in

28
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,820
the main

29
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,600
so what do we do now

30
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,920
uh what's quickly what is the daily it's

31
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,380
like the UMass UMass on the links it

32
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,920
describes who can access an object so as

33
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,380
a Defender we want to look for uh any

34
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,900
sdl that contains for example everyone W

35
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,600
of ID with full access and allow with a

36
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,960
there are multiple groups in a domain we

37
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,759
want to look for because it contains

38
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,159
basically uh too much too many objects

39
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,860
like all domain all users all computers

40
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,939
or domain guests

41
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:01,979
so with that we just have to look for in

42
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:04,320
plain text the strings I described like

43
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,038
wdd with fr4 for Access and if there are

44
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:10,560
any match basically someone needs

45
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,720
something wrong and you can give it a

46
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,020
slap

47
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,599
as I was uh no need for regex but you

48
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,599
can also use DirectX

49
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,300
and with those two methods you can get

50
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,640
rid of

51
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,440
many

52
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,879
share in your domain thank you
