1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,620
uh well hello my name is Sarah

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,600
melbaghawi and I'm an offensive

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,639
developer at Hexum but this doesn't

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:09,960
matter much because we're going to talk

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,360
about fighting games

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,240
um so this product is for all the

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,560
fighting games nerds and mechanical

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,320
keyboard fans as you'll see

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,760
first off

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,100
there are common fight scene controller

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,380
issues so like you know your average

12
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,680
artistic or your mix Box Etc

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,960
the Pokemon point is they're all bulky

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,700
they're very bulky and they're very hard

15
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,040
to carry if you are restricted on space

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,300
like you have a small bag or something

17
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,239
like that and with the case of lever

18
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,120
Architects uh they're too too noisy I

19
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,280
got yelled at for that

20
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,760
so I won't choose one again

21
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,879
and mix boxes are like better in some

22
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,260
way because they do less noise but

23
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,600
they're way too bulky and that's also an

24
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,340
issue when you want it to be portable

25
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,160
and maybe carry it at events Etc you

26
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,079
won't have to prepare a single luggage

27
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,359
for that

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,580
so I found the fightboard MX that's made

29
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,220
by one single guy and he'll say he sells

30
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,040
it on Etsy it's a very great controller

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,220
don't get me wrong but it has some cons

32
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,140
like it's very expensive you have to pay

33
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,380
170 Euros to get a chip to France and in

34
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,060
a complete State because you can buy it

35
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,180
without switches and keycaps

36
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,100
uh it's uh it uses a closed firmware

37
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,100
made by the same guy and uh you don't

38
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,560
have access to the 3D models and PCB

39
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,740
and it also uses a kind of wimpy

40
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,140
microcontroller it's a derivative of the

41
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,439
Arduino micro if I'm correct

42
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,439
so not good I mean it's good but not on

43
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,700
this point

44
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,579
so I made this one uh actually but the

45
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:48,659
one you see on the picture is the first

46
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:51,600
prototype that I've made

47
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,880
um as a software developer I've learned

48
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,820
a lot with electronics doing that and it

49
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,399
uses a Raspberry Pi Pico and an open

50
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,619
source firmware the gp24c Community

51
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:04,500
Edition firmware you can make it by

52
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,420
yourself because all of the files are

53
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,360
available on GitHub uh it means like you

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,120
have the Gerber files all the PCB files

55
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,040
basically the casing and also the

56
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,440
firmware so you can build one yourself

57
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,379
and I'll also create an Etsy shop but it

58
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:20,580
will be way cheaper than the fightboard

59
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,680
MX because I don't see why it's so

60
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,780
expensive

61
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,379
and that's the end
