uh... traffic on the website

98
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:46,839

there's several of them all here

108
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:10,379
isn't final runs only

109
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:15,759
a black box on the way it works it is as
a added a lot of things

110
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,629
the client is related to the broadcast

111
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:20,999
incident management changes

112
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:22,890

115
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,889
the parallel hahahaha blossoms are out
of your is basically show

116
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:37,310
conti ceo rather was case feels like

117
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,330
access control list it says

118
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,849
uh... certainly

119
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:42,519
well certainly is

120
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:45,789
they basically have a forceful traffic
rules

121
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:50,520
so that you guys could give him one

122
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,099
making some sort of

123
00:05:52,099 --> 00:05:54,060
miserable here

124
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,840
the scoreboard failure

125
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,470
in lebanon and see if there was a secure
stable helps the internet here actually

126
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,449
get them

127
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:04,799
this for almost orders of

128
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:08,419
that create some problems and of itself
because there is only one

129
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:11,069
there have been working on this

130
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:14,690
or traveling to get one because there's
a lot of things

131
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:15,949
bread

132
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:17,619
so that instead of actually

133
00:06:17,619 --> 00:06:18,419
exemplar

134
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:22,189

00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:34,240
rentals

137
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,919
that's about it

138
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,159
fatalistic

139
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:43,519
fort

140
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,300
it's very simple type

141
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,159
uh... there's no way to

142
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,660
one black box

143
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,129
was for parts

144
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:54,869
no longer than the intended recipient

145
00:06:54,869 --> 00:06:56,160
statement here

146
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,979
it is the access point

147
00:06:57,979 --> 00:07:02,330
taxes years last year we had to work
with and wireless networks

148
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:06,130
so that was incorporated into the cat

149
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,269
how nasty exit

150
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:11,620
analysis

151
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,680
ever did

152
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,369

uh...

159
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:26,860
but always a risk

160
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,120
it gets

161
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:34,129
and displaces the seizure dot org slash
thrown at us like something i think he

397
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,990
you've got to think about

398
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,150
princeton

399
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,980

changes in some instances

402
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,950
application works by doing that a
refresh every sixty seconds

403
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:46,710
side of this nature leslie regression
sixty seconds that's how it actually

404
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:47,970
works

405
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,460
participated

406
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,490
because it gets a copy of the flat

407
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:54,090
i wasn't particularly

408
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,680
yes it's the words that

409
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,670
flap over

410
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:00,030
prime minister farrakhan

411
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,549
a little bit better earlier

412
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:04,870
it actually does it have to last time

413
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,960
that that person

414
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,540
wikberg disintegration refresh sit if
this goes down

415
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,620
some happens after about this later

416
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,660
credit for uh...

417
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,950
wanted some retrieve said

418
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,940
is not

419
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,880
uh...

420
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,470
then i think it was the he previously

421
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:26,750
recruitment services

422
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:31,190
is a list of the titles up because the
this typical

423
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,140
on the loss of more assistance

424
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,330
services once a month and a bigger

425
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,850
so useful

426
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:42,570
they display account information is
gather

427
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:43,880
as they see it

428
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,230
we're going to see it

429
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:48,840
decides

430
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:55,840
vinaigrette

431
00:20:58,289 --> 00:21:00,090
pop

432
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:02,540
our calculations

433
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,430
additions planned

434
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,360
things should have been ahead

435
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,510
um... there are challenges to the

436
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,470
getting discourse opinion on the web
server

437
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,590
uh... because you do if he gets hollow

438
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,820
get somebody from

439
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,899
twenty seven years

440
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,900
pete one of the challenges you will

441
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,480
nancy this is the end of refresh

442
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,420
so

443
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:24,910
as you referred to as you can bring them
to cut it back to get together

444
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,620
but when it gets too

445
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:31,740
getting up at meetings

446
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,050
one of the information to another file

447
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:36,500
these approx objectivity

448
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,410
everywhere tried

449
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:40,950
at the beginning of great britain calls

450
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,550

451
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,820
reversible

452
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:49,640
bennett change that

453
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,280
yet sister

454
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,220
i think that

455
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,030
but yet yes

456
00:21:55,030 --> 00:22:00,260
that's why would they would say that
well i'd say that color you're right

457
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,850
exactly which is i think there's all
kinds of problems with the

458
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:08,600
that's why i didn't make it work and
that's what i did

459
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,770
fobel's

461
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:15,710
it works well

462
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:18,730
it was this is this is actually a
straight shot up

463
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:22,299
um... indian sulking indiana

464
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,419

senate without necessarily necessary

471
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,690

00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,050
via google problems with that

478
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:53,980
there's another thing

479
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:58,430
it is very popular to contain some
things are a problem

480
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:01,370
that you want to go down

481
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:02,620
so you can be able to find

482
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,850

483
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:09,180
it also works well for vmware you can
start of your rashid siddiqi

behind some people off but what you can
use

579
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:24,770
can see this year

580
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:25,960
but he's lucky

581
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,170
thinks these are although critical
services

582
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,600
the

583
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,320
extremist that you can export he's
program this possibly cvs

584
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,910
you cannot do

585
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:40,010
billions from this list

586
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:40,910

or will it stop

593
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,650
i learned today that visual studio
expresses for it

594
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,200
and you can use that as well

595
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,710
when she can use your

596
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:03,200
laura jean you see

597
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,480
uh... here's the tutorial

598
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,450
with uh... always financials

599
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:15,850
i can make everybody who

605
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,779
a lot of rituals that we don't have to

606
00:28:35,779 --> 00:28:39,720
front door knobs that though right

607
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,350
friend

608
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:44,929
the

609
00:28:44,929 --> 00:28:48,600
advocates of parts or something and
that's where it is

610
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,190
of possibilities

611
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,060
peaked at all

612
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,259
market what they were triggers

613
00:28:54,259 --> 00:28:56,700
that is probably not

614
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,980
there's a security basics fold

615
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,780
welfare

616
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:07,840
well that's a good place to get some
storage informational

617
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,990
user-friendly often his biblical i've
seen it

618
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:15,130
the reason why prophesy

619
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:18,890
and i work in the security

620
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,570
things that i think that's better

621
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:25,240
giving explicitly

622
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:29,810
gertrude haskell

623
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:34,960
perhaps that's why it works for the
glossy and sleek opment footbridge

624
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,220
was released out last month

625
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:44,220
uh... experience with her i was not the
intended to work

626
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:54,710
it was an issue hashish

627
00:29:54,710 --> 00:30:01,280
how

628
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,110
alone

629
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:07,260
i'd

out from itself from its from being
slaughtered yourself and uh...

632
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,940
wasn't really into talking on the stuff
up

633
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,200
or x

634
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,600

attacking the device itself in one of
the morals

636
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,700
and unlike what is this

637
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,160
looks horrible

638
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,400
firewalls

639
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,470
uh... acted within this place called

00:30:48,369 --> 00:30:49,490
work with the spring

644
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,899
have not tried it but i found that uh...

645
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:52,860
while i was doing

646
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:56,880
for the fat out there

647
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,870
it's got a lot of what's wrong

648
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:59,960
more cars save

649
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,250
more so than the men's football

650
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,080
sound i'll ask you out

651
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,990
inspire what's that

652
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,200
supported

653
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,210
mcintyre's busboy

654
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:16,330
back at

655
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:20,030
it was good

656
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:22,700
axiom and students

657
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:28,300
so passage about might have happened

658
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,150
effectively

659
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:32,470
let's talk about what the problem

660
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:35,580
accounts for about

661
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,960

662
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,400
brutal

663
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,320
it's either

664
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,960

665
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,800

667
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,530
i think this has been

668
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,490
sitting under but you saw a server

669
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:52,850
once the search for cities whatever

they keep talking

673
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:03,200
i don't think there's people who can
pull

674
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,720
