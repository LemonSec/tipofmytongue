some privacy and security

33
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,650
security's risk you don't want to start
with this

34
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,530

67
00:03:15,249 --> 00:03:16,420
worded

68
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:21,639
this fall right now

69
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:25,739
again we're going to support our actual

70
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,909
we reform our requirment

71
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:29,049
fairly rapidly

72
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:32,799
getting the importance of the right now

73
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,509
funds people

74
00:03:34,509 --> 00:03:36,139
newton

75
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:37,699
outdoing themselves in

with victor

77
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:42,479
but we're not located

78
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,339
there's margins but i wanted to be in
general

79
00:03:46,339 --> 00:03:49,039
cameras are startling just

80
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,689
contracts paradise

81
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,129
transfer

82
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:55,389
remain on the grounds that at work

83
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:56,419
problem with

84
00:03:56,419 --> 00:04:00,159
accusing medieval castle that's not
really horrible taylor

85
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,259
united states i will decide

86
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:09,709
the

87
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:13,619
unseated and that it was true

88
00:04:13,619 --> 00:04:15,239
inconsistent

89
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:17,939
competing with tracy

90
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:21,069
do you know that the other side

91
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:27,129
no energy built into the freemen's
tempers maintained and he's a jason

92
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:28,900
aforethought agrees

93
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,669
so that you thought the grease

94
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:31,789
all along

95
00:04:31,789 --> 00:04:35,020
obviously uh... agenda order that needs
to get there

96
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,470
opted to use

97
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,809
and i think that's right

98
00:04:37,809 --> 00:04:38,770
really deep

99
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,039
four-year

100
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:44,550
and you have a live event including
around here

101
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,680
of time

102
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,870
this is really expensive bills that we
looked into this option and it really

103
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,659
sticking up for

104
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:53,639
power

105
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:57,320

00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,270
desperately atmosphere

107
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,909
don't you

108
00:05:00,909 --> 00:05:04,339
didn't really like to see houghton

109
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:06,229

111
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:14,779
based in which is the reason it won't
agree with that

112
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:18,110
opt-in problems with this bar

113
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:21,639
it's not electrons electricity friendly

114
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:24,080
anything that really sensitive

115
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,669
internet access could use that we don't
know what is up

116
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:28,999
best option

117
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:31,110
desert it

so

746
00:37:13,259 --> 00:37:16,420
the effect that indicates that problem

747
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:20,409
uh... i'll say yes the farmer teamwork

748

pimlico

749
00:37:23,569 --> 00:37:25,459

752
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:38,310
the cheaper solution would be

753
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:40,329
it's really what's

754
00:37:40,329 --> 00:37:43,179
situated cheaper solution

755
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:46,149
digits the

756
00:37:46,149 --> 00:37:47,929
that'll be a bright

757
00:37:47,929 --> 00:37:54,929
uh... put up these repeatedly and
suggest that once we get to the popcorn

758
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,929
the software confused how do you know
it's pretty clear problem islands as it

759
00:37:59,929 --> 00:38:04,339
does not

760
00:38:04,339 --> 00:38:07,379
the same people in the environment
already

761
00:38:07,379 --> 00:38:10,029
expect people to get your collapsed

762
00:38:10,029 --> 00:38:13,119
which of the people that they need
immediately

763
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,159
went well

764
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,679
that's worth that

765
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:19,839
uh... properly on three years

766
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,710

robert holder

770
00:38:31,229 --> 00:38:33,499
absolutely despise

771
00:38:33,499 --> 00:38:35,349
uh... use copy copy

772
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:37,029

773
00:38:37,029 --> 00:38:38,889
hans uh...

774
00:38:38,889 --> 00:38:42,329
some access and even if that is as
plugins

775
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:46,529
so uh... that's the bad thing about it
because it has plugins

776
00:38:46,529 --> 00:38:48,759
sounded like you know it's not like

777
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:50,469
if you've got a lot of us

778
00:38:50,469 --> 00:38:53,539
served with wordpress west alike

779
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:54,460
uh... as well

form seoul

781
00:38:56,169 --> 00:39:00,309
on top cop figure it out

782
00:39:00,309 --> 00:39:05,019
best practices us which one should

783
00:39:05,019 --> 00:39:09,499
so this is the cheapest way god networks
which is laying around havana harbor

784
00:39:09,499 --> 00:39:16,499
going around here also offers

785
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:22,249
network that

786
00:39:22,249 --> 00:39:25,899
he's built like a months time

787
00:39:25,899 --> 00:39:27,249
your uh...

788
00:39:27,249 --> 00:39:28,799
looks like that's the

789
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:33,359
type of pc he's

790
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:36,279
and she's a seat on the internet

791
00:39:36,279 --> 00:39:39,239
yet all of this is what we heard her
pots

792
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:40,270
centric

793
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:44,380
i'm scared opposite

794
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:51,380
on for another thing that when i

795
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:54,330
which is a

796
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:55,880
forego poppycock

797
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:59,719
the reason logic is indian

798
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:01,769
has a favorite

799
00:40:01,769 --> 00:40:02,549
it also

800
00:40:02,549 --> 00:40:05,769
as begin taxes being demanding

801
00:40:05,769 --> 00:40:07,169
it said

802
00:40:07,169 --> 00:40:08,020
uh... traffic

803
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,919
for perot

804
00:40:09,919 --> 00:40:12,089
works and

805
00:40:12,089 --> 00:40:15,269
isn't happy about pork works the same

806
00:40:15,269 --> 00:40:16,859

807
00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:18,759
maintenance

808
00:40:18,759 --> 00:40:20,589
uh... what happened so

809
00:40:20,589 --> 00:40:27,589
i'm not as many reporter riskier

810
00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:31,619
is really wireless is this is like a
home

811
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:33,379
homes form

812
00:40:33,379 --> 00:40:35,309
of the problem

813
00:40:35,309 --> 00:40:36,810
in allows

814
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:41,389
uncertain access to the networks that
you have known controller

815
00:40:41,389 --> 00:40:42,649
appol

816
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:45,449
ally turkey is the world

817
00:40:45,449 --> 00:40:47,289
here

818
00:40:47,289 --> 00:40:49,269
so you cannot isolated

819
00:40:49,269 --> 00:40:51,219
network but when the plane

820
00:40:51,219 --> 00:40:52,989
and work here

821
00:40:52,989 --> 00:40:53,850
out there

822
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:55,879
whom collectively

823
00:40:55,879 --> 00:40:58,409
bulan always axis

824
00:40:58,409 --> 00:41:01,889
caucus also always acts as the d_n_c_

825
00:41:01,889 --> 00:41:08,889
say repugnant wage that actually
isolated

826
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:19,749
it was a reversal for starters

827
00:41:19,749 --> 00:41:23,799
to solve this little problem isn't so

828
00:41:23,799 --> 00:41:26,569
i think i have been called blocked off
traffic

829
00:41:26,569 --> 00:41:30,160
uh... well that's a lil suzy basically
lots of happiness

830
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,880
you know when he said

831
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,970
your net interest for your campuses that
is

832
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:38,019
so that it doesn't actually blog

833
00:41:38,019 --> 00:41:39,410

834
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:42,099

in the admin

836
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:45,989
so that's how to get our you're

837
00:41:45,989 --> 00:41:49,959
uh... it would be a little bit of a
enclosed firewalls you have to sell all

838
00:41:49,959 --> 00:41:51,179
the rules

839
00:41:51,179 --> 00:41:52,749
there's no

840
00:41:52,749 --> 00:41:54,589
as i said before with the

841
00:41:54,589 --> 00:41:57,509
plans for example

842
00:41:57,509 --> 00:41:59,829
flea control hamburger rules

843
00:41:59,829 --> 00:42:00,609
uh...

844
00:42:00,609 --> 00:42:07,289
the regardless addresses together

845
00:42:07,289 --> 00:42:08,719
arm

846
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:11,519
u_s_ interests

847
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:17,529
we're going to have

848
00:42:17,529 --> 00:42:21,269
we'll have the services such as yours

849
00:42:21,269 --> 00:42:25,699
eager organized a m_t_b_e_

850

secure personal

851
00:42:27,229 --> 00:42:28,639
you can use

852
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:30,700
services basically

853
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:34,299
outward was that the serbs are around

854
00:42:34,299 --> 00:42:37,569
there's forced altitude

855
00:42:37,569 --> 00:42:39,469
that's wonderful thing about the same

856
00:42:39,469 --> 00:42:45,099
and is it makes it easier for other
people don't understand it

857
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:49,249
this is what this does your the for

858
00:42:49,249 --> 00:42:50,829
addresses

859
00:42:50,829 --> 00:42:55,079
which makes it easier for the people who
have been

860

00:51:35,279 --> 00:51:38,890
they've said they wanted to do you think
the which is the way we have just

1034
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:40,079
started

1035
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:41,769
but also

1036
00:51:41,769 --> 00:51:45,409
so the idea is that they come up with me

1037
00:51:45,409 --> 00:51:46,749
there in that

1038
00:51:46,749 --> 00:51:50,719
they spent a lot of things like they
said well we want

1039
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:53,239
x boxes of hard work

1040
00:51:53,239 --> 00:51:56,839
and things like that as a group

1041
00:51:56,839 --> 00:52:00,199
we sit down and think about a lot

1042
00:52:00,199 --> 00:52:01,360
real-life pizza

1043
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,679
away at that

1044
00:52:02,679 --> 00:52:07,729
so if you can do things that go to meet
with him let up

1045
00:52:07,729 --> 00:52:08,579
is the walls

1051
00:52:18,709 --> 00:52:21,619
won something the some would-be still in
