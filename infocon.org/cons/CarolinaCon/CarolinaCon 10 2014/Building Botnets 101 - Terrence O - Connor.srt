1
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,500
so there is a live demo and

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,139
hopefully works you'll see some demand
and just done

3
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,160
das a mantra and awesome as well

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,000
as long as we go through that will be
fine I

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,400
I work for a company called occupy some
you guys might

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,060
know who we are just a level set we we
do

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,950
content delivery some the largest web
sites in the world so we see

8
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,930
roughly between 15 and 30 percent all
web traffic on the internet so

9
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,500
I put this together for one of our
conferences and I thought it would be a

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,260
good thing to you present here

11
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,900
I'm just based on our visibility and
what we've done with summer

12
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,300
customers as well as what we've seen
kinda been awhile

13
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,980
so I'll show you kinda how easy it is
for

14
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,610
on one by net in particular to be built
up

15
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,059
on I do not have the command-and-control

16
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:05,000
in the demo but I'll explain kinda how
easy it is to you control the things I'm

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,600
gonna actually

18
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,009
execute with my browser I mean you can
extrapolate from that

19
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:12,340
kinda how easy it would be to create a

20
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,380
command control infrastructure around us
okay

21
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,740
so I'll do some level setting I am

22
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,180
will have some discussion and all
getting will do a live demo

23
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,200
so you really got my intro

24
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,990
on some security concepts really high
level

25
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,360
on what are the attacker motivations I
think we

26
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,590
we all understand Somerset's gonna be
political financially them are you

27
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:40,070
on glory or it's Tuesday and I just

28
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,520
feel like attacking somebody and we've
seen a lot of that lately

29
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,640
and we've also seen love extortion I
don't know if anybody in here works for

30
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,220
the government but we've been seeing

31
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,320
and it's not a lot of extortion I'll
take down somebody's infrastructure

32
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,640
web sites in Alaska for 150 bucks to
stop I'm so it's

33
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,790
it's not a lot of money but it's a it's
a huge impact businesses

34
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,670
on some the impact that we've been
seeing

35
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:08,709
it's gonna be data loss service
interruption fraud we saw some

36
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:12,150
using botnet de dos as well as bird
force

37
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,840
parts and we were seeing some

38
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,120
say commerce customers they were getting
less of the Internet

39
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,489
going to they're doing carting attacks
on

40
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:27,540
buying goods can bring those goods into
cash pretty easily

41
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,700
and using just the really simple but
nice to be able to execute attacks

42
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,709
I am attack method it's gonna be

43
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:38,959
your normal dude of attacks sometimes
it'll be man in the middle

44
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,269
over the last few weeks for pricey more
that then we should

45
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:48,739
a hijacking redirection so we've seen a
lot of attacks against innocent for

46
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:49,510
structure

47
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,459
I'm interjecting their own DNS redirect
them somewhere else or alternatively

48
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:53,940
just

49
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,959
getting your credentials going injured
DNS infrastructure redirecting in summer

50
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:01,100
we've also been seeing on BGP hijacking

51
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,970
so whether it's on purpose or by
accident we've seen a lot of companies

52
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:11,930
on have pretty pretty big swath through
the internet hijacked and filed over to

53
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:15,489
Asia women

54
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:18,530
and and then all the other application

55
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:22,620
your taxes sequins action which I'll
enough I'm not as concerned with as I

56
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,329
used to be

57
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:27,340
I'm much more concerned with command
injection

58
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:32,310
or remote file inclusion attacks now I
am

59
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,019
just some level setting up anybody want
to shout out what again this is 0

60
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:39,190
applic web application Center discussion

61
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:43,190
anybody has any on concerns that

62
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,810
they think ur you know really important
to their organization for them

63
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:51,650
just shut up some stuff maybe career but
that

64
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,440
watering hole about one

65
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,519
after tell me that I'm and the else

66
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,519
will prolly cover some other thing that
you guys are are concerned with the

67
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:05,840
maybe maybe some that year

68
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,669
not as concerned anybody use cloud
infrastructure for their

69
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:12,979
web sites applications yet

70
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:16,500
avails yeah that

71
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,899
deeply concerned me now so in all kind
explain that a second

72
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,389
so what keeps he says up and I think we
all understand that's because they yell

73
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:23,940
at us

74
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,070
and tell us make it not happen I might
lose my job

75
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,120
data breaches thats really bad

76
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,349
passers availability that cost money a

77
00:04:33,349 --> 00:04:36,849
billing attacks so if you're using a
double yes if you're using other cloud

78
00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:37,430
providers

79
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,439
it's really easy to scale up they want
you to scale but

80
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:44,449
that has your bottom line every time so
if you can't predict the

81
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:49,860
billing structure your website so it's
usually a gradual ramp and if I execute

82
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,009
if you piss me off I'm a competitor and
I say

83
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:56,610
attacked this company on you know maybe
we'll

84
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,990
effector ban with both like your
utilization on the number of instances

85
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,930
you use over a period of time

86
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:07,060
I'm it's a its definitely a concern I
extrapolated for one customer

87
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,129
what their overage charges would have
been if if they had to scale up

88
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:11,310
infrastructure

89
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,370
and it was in the hundreds of thousands
per month so

90
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,039
if you're not planning on that
adjustment you you should plan for now

91
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:21,199
usually it's one of those things where
you work with your provider and say

92
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,479
ATM and cost capping Murphy capping at a
certain level at four under attack

93
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,120
we you know we're scaling up you know
rapidly for

94
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:36,000
some sort event the last one brand
protection we always talk about that one

95
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,189
but a people still shop at Target people
still shop at Martin Macks

96
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:47,349
yes think it's like a six month cycle on
people usually forget what happened

97
00:05:47,349 --> 00:05:50,509
okay so what we see and again in about
30 percent over

98
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:54,300
traffic on the internet that we're gonna
be be seeing from a web application

99
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,789
standpoint

100
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:58,939
on DNS hijacking were saying that
because that's

101
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:02,949
power infrastructure operates so we see
anybody

102
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:07,539
hijacking the house from a customer will
see dips in traffic that everything

103
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:11,669
adidas but not spreading on lanix and

104
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:15,479
mostly lacks machines when those
machines we haven't seen too much

105
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:19,090
except for if they get some our machine
from an internal

106
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:22,509
infections point and

107
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:25,949
and from adidas perspective we see
everything its S&P

108
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:30,180
be an ass NTP runs the gamut

109
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,330
and then this is actually a little bit
old the last attack that we saw

110
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,689
was about 290 with per second on

111
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:40,999
like customers come to us and say hey
what

112
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:45,300
you know what happens what's this with
the biggest attack you've seen him we

113
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,020
we go on their way well with delivered
lots of traffic but the biggest attacks

114
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,469
we see are usually in

115
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:55,370
100 on and then customers think they can
scale up to be

116
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,919
you know roughly that size is just not
not feel you don't do it alone

117
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,069
management nightmare

118
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:06,129
you have to globally distributed
architectures the pain

119
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:09,990
I'm like I was saying but not limited to
a CPA CBS

120
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,509
you'll see in a sec and I'm executing an
ATP

121
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:16,919
attack by I kid easily transfer my
script to do

122
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:20,199
DNS NTP reflection pretty much whatever

123
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:24,439
i won S&M as an MP walking reflection

124
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:28,159
we were having an internal discussion im
and we're saying other new things as an

125
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:28,740
MP

126
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:33,979
I said no the new things neut p traffic
that doesn't verify

127
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:37,129
origin resources for us if I can

128
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:40,330
if I can send your YouTube the packet
and say that it's coming from somewhere

129
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,129
else

130
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:44,810
here to send a response there so I just
have to pick a protocol its gonna send

131
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,830
BP response in a little on a little
request

132
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:54,460
that's the next attack so I said just
pick one

133
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:59,210
okay robot in action so robots the tool
that we we got some code for sale show

134
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,330
you what that looks like it's

135
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:04,969
its ridiculously simple but it had a
huge impact on pretty much every bank in

136
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:06,559
the last couple years

137
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:11,169
on lots of down time I don't know if you
guys can remember

138
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:14,300
I am all the banks that were down like a
name any names but

139
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,840
pretty much all were were attacked and
had some story about a job that part I

140
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,979
was in a small outage was

141
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:24,029
hours or days

142
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:27,599
and the the group that was X in these
attacks was the

143
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,409
absence I'm cyber fighters so they were
doing the DoS attacks number also

144
00:08:31,409 --> 00:08:36,779
attacking application infrastructures
well

145
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:40,360
I'm so what what are we saying the
attackers dang so

146
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,279
just over the last few %um last few
months we've seen

147
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:48,279
I am services come online so you can go

148
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:51,370
by services they scale in the clouds
they're going to execute these things

149
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,380
like me

150
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:57,570
anybody else using I would so they'll by
Nadal vs and stencil rotate the IP's

151
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,180
they'll

152
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,250
execute the attack so that
infrastructure Amazon

153
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,339
doesn't necessarily care they're gonna
bill for the traffic on they're gonna

154
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:07,860
use a stolen credit cards and an ability
for credit card they put on file

155
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,980
and they're using the same techniques
that we use to protect

156
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:15,360
I'm to attack

157
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,389
make sense right so here's the question
why is it so easy

158
00:09:19,389 --> 00:09:24,000
for them to be able to execute these
just monolithic attacks Paul

159
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
how many people run a PHP site

160
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,910
I should be everybody's but PHP is
probably the

161
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:37,529
so you get word press I to get him under
ball whatever's

162
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:40,670
lot of big companies use the stuff for
marking sites

163
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:43,920
campaign sides things that they don't
necessarily care about

164
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,829
but the thing is when you're hosting
knees on cloud infrastructure you've got

165
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:49,320
a lot about

166
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,899
you've got easily injectable machines
because

167
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:56,199
other by a template on some temple
provider it's got

168
00:09:56,199 --> 00:10:00,510
attempt on drop and it's got some other
drop in that nobody know their

169
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,220
I don't necessarily update on I'll go
buy a template I don't know what's in

170
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,329
there

171
00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:08,410
I'll all goes cant periodically to see
if there's anything worried about but

172
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:11,740
brought in some purposes be people don't
look for that and

173
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,079
were pressed for these other I'm
frameworks down

174
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:18,540
tell you about because they don't know
that this drop in this version

175
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,199
you there plugin infrastructure billeted
that but if it's a drop in its

176
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:25,490
its I and there's just

177
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,680
so many injection points out there

178
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,880
that you can execute on I think

179
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,620
I was going to use the vulnerability
database never

180
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,829
21 100

181
00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:42,300
remote file inclusion vulnerability so
you just search for one you don't have

182
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,060
to find it

183
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,699
you search for one that's out there I
guarantee you that there's

184
00:10:46,699 --> 00:10:49,759
over a million machines that have not
been updated that you can execute

185
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:50,769
against

186
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:54,120
begin do you know Google dork to be able
to see if

187
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,259
to me using an outdated version temper

188
00:10:57,259 --> 00:11:00,529
run through that grab all the links up
for Google

189
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:05,230
execute your your injections on all
those hoes and now you've got

190
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:10,199
a botnet X hundreds of thousands

191
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:13,470
and they're very well connected so if
you're on a double yesteryear on

192
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,529
Go Daddy earlier on

193
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:19,870
11 hosting whoever your hosting provider
is

194
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:24,040
they've got big pipes I mean it usually
between 20 to 40 gigs on each one and

195
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,680
then if you're at

196
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:30,670
it up the ass its you know hundreds and
gags per data center

197
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,240
and to my knowledge they don't
necessarily limit the ballot depending

198
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,209
on what what

199
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:40,060
which kinda box you have I think we all
understand as a file in your box which

200
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,290
means I got something that

201
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:44,600
that I created on that box I controlling

202
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:50,880
and your service I mean on your
customers and I'm going on a reputation

203
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,360
okay so where the tools and techniques
that I'm about to show you and then

204
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,620
we'll get into the actual

205
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,860
them

206
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:02,410
okay so wired built this using word
press in OpenCart

207
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:06,000
is word press is the predominant

208
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,050
CMS on the Internet today so it's
roughly about at

209
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:12,300
when I wrote this was roughly about $71
million

210
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:17,470
site either use Word Press and they're
on multiple multiple hosts out there

211
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:21,509
on you've got lotsa drop and they can
execute

212
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:26,060
remote file inclusion attacks against on
what's a band with

213
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,199
and it's really easy to find on Google
because everybody wants those things

214
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:30,160
searchable

215
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,420
on if anybody's used tampon it in the
links

216
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,759
so you can search for on the casting
director is an attempt on file name:

217
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,100
or the pattern that ten them users to
actually pull

218
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,100
extra content cash it you can figure out
where their point content from

219
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,300
which means that they've allowed it to
be pulled from that location and then

220
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,680
you can

221
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,740
enter your code there and poll that
Oakley

222
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,750
as well so if it's on Flickr some other

223
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,290
location that you can pour on textual
content you can

224
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:04,319
pollitt dump it on the file system and
then be able to execute that

225
00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:08,389
okay so we got were pressed we will XQ
the a taxable

226
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:12,329
inject some things on were present an
attempt on

227
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:16,680
plays down hack the machine while London
I

228
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,190
will pool file locally a on that system

229
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:24,819
will execute a deed of the tag notch a
show you the impact on a

230
00:13:24,819 --> 00:13:29,389
unprotect machine and then a machine
were using a different type

231
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:34,190
protection mechanism I'm and show you
the difference in the CPU utilization

232
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:38,560
its extremely easy to take down web
infrastructure using a very very small

233
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,750
box I'm using the smallest

234
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,370
it'll be us instances lacks any
individual ocean but I'm using really

235
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:48,690
really small

236
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:53,380
never used illusion I moved over from 80
yes I

237
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:57,129
I like 'em good stuff and endorsing a
product

238
00:13:57,129 --> 00:14:00,350
I like on okay so

239
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:03,790
the word press system once we inject a
lower scripts on their we're going to

240
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:08,440
execute the Dusit attack against
OpenCart is up in part because it's a

241
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,690
pretty well-known carting system to sell
products on the internet

242
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:17,509
it's open source is freely available and
it's actually pretty good

243
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:20,980
everything when I created this was fully
patched

244
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:25,190
so I I think I'm still pretty good I
think updated everything

245
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:32,190
ever now and against our cloud hosted I
think everything's fully pass updated

246
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:36,850
don't look at the screen and then tell
me that it's not I think

247
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:41,250
I am okay so Word Press it's about one
powers about 160 all sites on the

248
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,000
internet

249
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,740
kinda talk about that Joomla Drupal
people use that as well

250
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:50,019
on if it's PHP you have the same problem

251
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:53,430
I don't know what it is about PHP but
either its terrible developers are

252
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:53,980
releasing

253
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,310
code or I'm people just don't realize

254
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:00,370
how easy it is to be able to execute
attacks

255
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:04,079
and PHP doesn't really locked down the
infrastructure very well

256
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,430
and so you need the access to rate files
yes

257
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:11,459
if your script or your applications that
cleaning up for validating content very

258
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:12,660
well

259
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:17,970
it's pretty easy to get the stuff into a
box and people executed

260
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:21,000
okay why I picked in time for this
because it is

261
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,550
a II had to find something to be able to
get something out the box that

262
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,480
is and a lot of teams it's being used
pretty

263
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,060
you know pretty widely across the
internet on it's something that we've

264
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:37,730
seen being used to execute these really
massive

265
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:42,379
you know 304 million 302 $20 million
requests per second

266
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:45,699
attacks against customers on so

267
00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:48,680
I went looked okay what's the attack
better that they're using it was

268
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,069
generally always a well-connected
hosting provider

269
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:55,680
page piece i and dig in a little bit
deeper and

270
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,250
and looking at how 10 marks 10 them was
the culprit for mothers and

271
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,560
the infected hundreds of thousands
machines and Nate they were rotating

272
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,300
he's in and out just in on mass

273
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,149
on why pick this one ok it's a small PHP
script

274
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:15,930
it's supposed to be use for pulling
external image content

275
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:19,360
resizing and allowing you to cash that
locally so you can serve it faster

276
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,730
if you're doing any content delivery you
can

277
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:26,670
use that as well too push out what's in
store locally

278
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,990
on makes things a lot easier for you on

279
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:35,519
you know pitcher side using responsive
it will resize it the way that you want

280
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,610
on and it's pretty its it's pretty well
distribute out there on

281
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:44,009
a lot of sites I use this one when I was
digging into it I wasn't sure how easy

282
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:45,019
would be

283
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:50,110
to actually get a remote file onto the
system and be able to execute a script

284
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:53,230
on it was incredibly easy

285
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:57,139
the way that it works miss Eva gonna
slide on if not I'll just

286
00:16:57,139 --> 00:17:01,350
talk to it okay so the way that works is
when you

287
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:05,160
you basically append a source location
external image file

288
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,209
or any file on it goes out polls that
locally

289
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:14,030
and then starts its own of Cashel Oakley
and then I'll start to try to resize it

290
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:17,100
figure out what mind mime type: it is on

291
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,900
cash it in the different formats that
you want and

292
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,950
that's pretty much it so it doesn't
validate you can do some Orjan

293
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:28,880
or external yeah extra-large
invalidation so

294
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,510
certain domains things like that but
while demand that our default

295
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,910
in that list cancer sexual misconduct

296
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:39,590
so I can put a script out there Paul
Oakley and then have my

297
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:44,360
my PHP script run and the weather cash
is it locally as it

298
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:49,260
does md5 hash on the entire your L that
your plan as the source content

299
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,860
and it doesn't see the hash or anything
like that it doesn't you don't proceed

300
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,800
value and they're just

301
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,310
md5 hashes the whole thing I

302
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:01,200
if it externally append an external
underscoring the md5 hash

303
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,890
and keep the ballot pension so if it's a
PHP file

304
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:10,200
its gonna keep that PHP file extensions
so I'm gonna be able to just natively

305
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,400
by hitting that external underscore md5
hash that PHP

306
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,280
I should be able to execute that script
on the box and because the file

307
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,790
permissions that you generally have to
set up to be on the casters file

308
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:26,150
you can generally you know if people set
it up the way that

309
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:30,140
the due out in the box you can execute
the script natively on them

310
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:33,990
on the box and be able to figure out
where they were running can't do they

311
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:37,100
have curled have some other thing that I
can execute a heart attack

312
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,100
now use FTP can I do brute force

313
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,900
you know if if you just run a PHP and
PostScript on their

314
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:49,100
and you dump out what you have available
you can customize your tactical XQ

315
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:53,890
whatever you want from Apple's not to
mention you're on the box you can

316
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:57,460
about files you can transfer things
externally its

317
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,470
its pretty that

318
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,600
if you want I can actually pull up the

319
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,220
temp number you can actually go look
attempt on itself its

320
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:11,730
open source project now on temperature

321
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:14,900
in fact if it validates and then it
tries to resize the image in a can't

322
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,900
resize the images

323
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:21,030
kinda leaves the files out there so
doesn't even clean up after itself

324
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:24,450
and it doesn't restrict php file names
because you could have a dynamically

325
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,430
generated

326
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,770
image or something like that just

327
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:32,480
terrible I mean I like it because it
makes demoss

328
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,710
pretty good on

329
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,710
oh yeah now it's its terrible there's

330
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:45,510
lotsa lotsa PHP

331
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:49,500
you know backdoor or scripts that you
can load on the system's

332
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,540
and it's just its terrifyingly easy to
do it through a temp

333
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:56,080
you could search Google right now for
anybody running 10 than and started

334
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,940
testing

335
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:00,100
and if you can get a PHP fell on their
the

336
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,650
that they don't change Paso Fino the MP
5x yet

337
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:07,610
the md5 hash in the location point on at
a PHP file

338
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:10,840
just right run it from the cache
location if it works

339
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:16,370
you've got a system you can that I mean
don't do that but

340
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:19,380
right I am so I

341
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,690
what we're saying is that I'm gonna show
you some code from Burbach just to show

342
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,510
you how easy it is to

343
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:27,840
bring down really heavy infrastructure
on the Internet

344
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,030
on this attack in the scripts for use
primarily by

345
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:36,110
the ups on separate fires was a Iranian

346
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:41,200
yes community it wasn't necessarily com

347
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,740
it wasn't necessarily the government but
it was a group

348
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:49,430
activists within Iran there was a video
posted on YouTube

349
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:53,100
on they got angry about that and they
said we're going to exit the attacks in

350
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,130
effect

351
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,600
X amount of financial burden across

352
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,810
the financial industry so it's all

353
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:03,920
you know it's rough numbers they say
will will take you down this is how much

354
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,370
we think it cost you

355
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,440
I'm ever gonna do it until we incur this

356
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,810
amount to billions of dollars in in
impact

357
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:16,070
and they were they were pretty
successful I

358
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:20,580
very simple script easily uploaded
easily executed and it creates massive

359
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,300
traffic in CPU utilization

360
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,520
the at the origins

361
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,530
you see this on so be

362
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:32,200
bro by kurt is quite simply

363
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,240
a hurl function that iterates through

364
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,840
some random I strings has a target

365
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,450
and just executes thousands and
thousands of crore pressed against that

366
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,640
target

367
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,650
at it so they

368
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:52,210
they did do one thing right here so
there's I think all the cash busting

369
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,090
technique if you're catching traffic

370
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:57,690
I'm your cashing provider is going to
serve the traffic in a doctor

371
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,980
there there for structure is many many
many

372
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:05,400
terabit 10 determines traffic del Sur
that content all day long

373
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,890
they've got feet P protection on the
problem is that

374
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:13,890
the way that most those in again this
this is pretty customizable but you have

375
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,140
to think about it when you're

376
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,830
implement on if you randomized free
strings on me

377
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:22,120
and content from a caching provider

378
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,840
on usually it's gonna go back to the
order because

379
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,580
think that's a different his account so
the one thing that they did right here

380
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,970
what they were randomized strings and

381
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:36,380
the actual euro on so what you would
need to do to be able to prevent

382
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,770
something like that is you have to
ignore those pre strings on the end of

383
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:40,980
this year

384
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:44,930
so the next in a second was randomized
the fun

385
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:48,190
okay well when you what we do in an
instance well at the roundabout in the

386
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,370
file names

387
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:53,370
bombing new things like rate controlling
or looking for

388
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:57,370
patterns within those required so it
gets a lot more complicated

389
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:00,990
that's kinda what all Australia 2nd
really easy to execute

390
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:04,080
really really hard

391
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,980
especially if they've got hundreds and
thousands like you they can rotate and

392
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,700
now

393
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,650
you're a controlling usually kinda after
period time so them you're blocking IP

394
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:15,100
that I feel the block for X amount of
time a cable

395
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,280
I wrote another and I like it now just
do it every

396
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,930
five minutes

397
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:25,140
okay I'm gonna show you the attack right
now and then I'll I'll explain some

398
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,030
other defenses

399
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:31,340
and actually show you one thing that
works pretty well

400
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:36,040
alright live demo

401
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,450
so what you're gonna see here at the top
is about my OpenCart system on the left

402
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:40,850
are

403
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:45,700
I just have a stop burning up here and
then on the other side we have another

404
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,800
system that our protection system

405
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,210
and we're not connected the attack
against that one will do that

406
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:54,440
after the initial attack against our
demoss

407
00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:01,440
then hit bottom so let me log back into
my time change

408
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:06,280
all rights down here the bottom we I'll
just show you how it caches the

409
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,340
files locally cuz its

410
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:13,600
okay so my cash is clear right now I'm
just need my browser to

411
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,080
XQ these attacks the first thing I'm
gonna do

412
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,770
is I am going to all first I'll show you
the

413
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:24,040
the open court system the default the
box

414
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,600
I did the you now normal install

415
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,280
throwing my sequel pretty simple

416
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,580
I have a demand execute just

417
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:40,750
dumped out the textual PHP scripts

418
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:45,520
so I've got one here that's page p.m.
for you actually wanna see the full

419
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,560
on for a bot script this is what it
looks like I've got

420
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,980
you know I've got my targets it's got
all the

421
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:56,930
looping statements at scotts you know
it's got some randomized restrains

422
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:01,350
so it's looks like

423
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:06,310
on how many people are at some point

424
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:11,200
okay so what we'll do is we'll actually
load the script on the surround show you

425
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:11,650
what that

426
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:16,060
string looks like okay I get there great
I'm using an

427
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:19,300
oliver temper my think it's couple years
old

428
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:23,100
on had and that's something that I can

429
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:28,020
on so you do the 10th on script so
that's that that PHP script at the end

430
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,620
the original the querystring as source
and then

431
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:35,780
the source that point from are my bad
scripts so in this case is that PHP and

432
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,450
profile

433
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:39,970
on in like I was telling you before
because we know

434
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:43,000
the way that 10th on stores that file
locally

435
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,040
will be able to execute that just by
going to catch location using that

436
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,150
that string consulate executed

437
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:53,590
I'll show you what this looks like okay

438
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:57,340
so it dumped out the PHP info so this is
great because now I know

439
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:02,240
everything I can boss I know what where
I am from locations damn plan

440
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,420
models label oh did I know what I can do
from

441
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:08,700
a an attack perspective if I was
actually if I'm

442
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,840
if I'm gonna build a big pot now what I
could do is load this in their

443
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,280
by or loan other script and I just
checks for the components that any

444
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:20,390
and then load the purple iz get
prescription load the appropriate

445
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,060
scripts and their

446
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,520
afterwards and then executes multiple
attacks against

447
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,600
mobile device the really interesting
thing is

448
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,710
the people that have been compromised by
this

449
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:36,220
I I'm just do they get like an a ridge
bill do they see that

450
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:39,770
you know at some point the attackers are
also affecting

451
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:43,750
the billing cycle those customers unless
they have like an unlimited plan or

452
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,040
something like that

453
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:49,330
but even the ISP is down I don't know if
they don't care they don't do anything

454
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,010
about it but

455
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:54,480
they're saying is huge traffic spikes
and we're we're not seeing as I Q

456
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,690
being taken down so you know they don't
know that it's happening over its under

457
00:26:58,690 --> 00:26:59,190
their

458
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:02,710
radar or it's not hitting some billing
cycle in some is going

459
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:05,890
why do I have like a ten thousand dollar
bad weather

460
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:09,540
coverage for this month

461
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:13,070
I would notice because some microkernel

462
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:16,500
you okay

463
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,580
so I've got my deed of the tax credits
those did us a tack strips have

464
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:24,260
about 20 I got one hitting man protected
system which I'm gonna show you right

465
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,360
now

466
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,680
I'm so this is a low that

467
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,030
attack script here okay and again

468
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:37,270
just to show you what it looks like so
it catches these things extra ones for

469
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:40,550
if it's the external file it's got the
md5 hash

470
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:46,380
and then it uses the extension at a pool

471
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,850
really tear um

472
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:55,630
and then if we want we can actually see
what's in these files

473
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:59,350
okay so that's my the DoS attack script

474
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:04,460
and will see here is again on the top
left that are open park system and the

475
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,890
CPU right now because I'm running each
stop is

476
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:10,180
roughly between 1&2 percent

477
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:14,540
really small really small box

478
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:18,430
so let's execute the attack I could do a
curl statement execute the attack

479
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:21,810
I could have my command control ever
start for that knows where all my parts

480
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:22,520
are

481
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,860
execute these the only thing you need to
do to execute this attack

482
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:31,170
is hit the script it spins up its on
process on worker process

483
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:34,990
if you're using Apache or some other PHP
intermediate

484
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:38,090
spent at its own worker and at worker
will stay

485
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:43,200
if you in a separate variables that
worker will run until it's done

486
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,380
which is if you're attacked

487
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:50,450
okay so will execute that I'm just using
my brother executed

488
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:54,330
so will hit her and protected machine
now texting

489
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:57,830
and this is one attacker one instance if
a worker

490
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:02,530
on that machine and its generally gonna
pegged at CPU right around a hundred

491
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:02,950
percent

492
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:06,510
if I hit refresh by spin up

493
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:09,510
extra processes for workers

494
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:16,510
we should be able to pay get saving get
all the way up to

495
00:29:22,539 --> 00:29:26,230
oh well ninety-six percent close enough
the site probably

496
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:29,759
unusable or it will take so long for
somebody to get to that site that we're

497
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:30,629
gonna go somewhere else

498
00:29:30,629 --> 00:29:33,710
on if you're dealing with commerce sites
it

499
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:37,289
people are fickle gonna go immediately
to another provider that they can buy

500
00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:38,230
the product from

501
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:43,369
if the banking site get a little bit
more leeway except if you can get here

502
00:29:43,369 --> 00:29:47,749
banking site to transact business then
lot of people earn

503
00:29:47,749 --> 00:29:50,799
the pain if it's a

504
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,330
another one as if it's a trading site so
if you're

505
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:58,999
using an online trading provider and you
can't get to their site

506
00:29:58,999 --> 00:30:03,419
and you need to execute trades the fall
back as you call them are

507
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:06,679
on if everybody's gone at the same time
have

508
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:09,679
transmissions if you can execute a
strange one

509
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:15,570
XQ yet this was

510
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:19,259
so it doesn't matter so they used be
used and the five

511
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:22,580
as the hashing mechanism for the file
name so that

512
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:27,499
you can identify with been cashed on
they can use whatever they wanted

513
00:30:27,499 --> 00:30:30,619
it's just a night in a fire for that
file name:

514
00:30:30,619 --> 00:30:35,769
that they pull local yet so md5 is just
the store location other

515
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:40,200
cash that the easiest way to understand
why they did that

516
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,779
is if I'm plan to file locally I don't
necessarily want that entire

517
00:30:43,779 --> 00:30:47,720
URL string is the founder and that's not
work for me so the md5 that

518
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,070
that source address and that's what they
use as the file

519
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:55,909
convention the founding so it doesn't it
doesn't really have anything to do with

520
00:30:55,909 --> 00:30:57,809
hash other than you know what the file

521
00:30:57,809 --> 00:31:02,070
name is going to be when story and the
one thing that I would have done is

522
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:05,580
as I would have seen it the value and
probably is the bigger

523
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,950
that way it's a little bit harder to
figure out what that scene value is so

524
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,169
you don't necessarily know

525
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:13,440
with the name is one in stores locally
but they didn't

526
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,830
did on so how do I

527
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:23,460
stop my attack I just restart Apache so
I can restart all the workers and then

528
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,149
it should

529
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:29,249
your one interesting thing that we were
saying it when we were executing

530
00:31:29,249 --> 00:31:32,740
taxes if you have a very fast protection

531
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:36,889
and a pretty big scale you're gonna
start impacting the machine

532
00:31:36,889 --> 00:31:39,850
requesting the contents you're gonna
start impacting the attacker in the

533
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:41,869
attacker CPU load starts going up

534
00:31:41,869 --> 00:31:45,190
and years kinda stays stays the same so
it's just a

535
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:52,190
a byproduct there so how do you

536
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:58,840
what's if I gots how do you defend
against um

537
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,169
defense is a really really hard so

538
00:32:02,169 --> 00:32:05,990
they can change their scripts lot faster
you can change your protection

539
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:10,359
on rate controls work pretty well unless
they have a lot of machines that they're

540
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:11,190
attacking from

541
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:15,009
so they're going to rotate IP's and
either generated attackers and now

542
00:32:15,009 --> 00:32:18,100
you know we were saying

543
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,869
roughly between fifteen hundred thousand
I P on time

544
00:32:21,869 --> 00:32:26,409
so it's I mean they just have this huge
infrastructure they can pull from

545
00:32:26,409 --> 00:32:29,919
because the Internet is kinda wild west
and people down

546
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,720
update their stuff you know their site
out there that I prolly have that I

547
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,480
forgot about

548
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,990
on which is not a good thing but I
haven't gotten a bill on my credit card

549
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:38,690
yet that's

550
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:43,019
well higher-than-expected um popular use
an 80

551
00:32:43,019 --> 00:32:49,519
ABS now really big pipes you know they
can randomized content they can see what

552
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,320
you're actually using as protection

553
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,450
%uh rate controls have been the most
effective for us

554
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:57,690
and being able to defend against dedust
attacks but

555
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:02,259
brute force for low-volume attacks now
you start looking at

556
00:33:02,259 --> 00:33:07,039
okay how do I prevent them from heating
my resource intensive stuff I can cash

557
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:10,539
you know it doesn't matter what cashing
provider use you can cash

558
00:33:10,539 --> 00:33:13,769
everything at the edges the networks so
it doesn't have to hit your

559
00:33:13,769 --> 00:33:14,529
infrastructure

560
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:18,249
I I would wanna say that on pretty much
all sites you can cash

561
00:33:18,249 --> 00:33:24,609
95 to ninety-seven percent your contact
images CSS JavaScript your base

562
00:33:24,609 --> 00:33:28,059
pages and the only thing that you my

563
00:33:28,059 --> 00:33:31,960
not necessarily be able to cash would be
dynamic content polls

564
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:36,679
so and you can you can also catch those
workers on

565
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:40,899
so what I would say is cash everything
you can to the edge if you have to pull

566
00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:42,769
content so your search login

567
00:33:42,769 --> 00:33:47,080
on anything that might be dynamic has to
be refreshed constantly

568
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,779
those are the things we need a deeper
level of protection to rate controls my

569
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:52,509
network if they've got a lot to like he
is

570
00:33:52,509 --> 00:33:56,639
and so how do we prevent them from
actually going to your organ execute

571
00:33:56,639 --> 00:34:00,269
quest whether to buy it has to know
where to put those

572
00:34:00,269 --> 00:34:04,779
values right so if that doesn't put the
values in the right spot you can block

573
00:34:04,779 --> 00:34:07,789
if it doesn't have the thing that you're
expecting block

574
00:34:07,789 --> 00:34:11,530
so one other things that on

575
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:16,490
that I was working on and and summer
Mike

576
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:20,599
so my friend for working hours how do we
actually prevent

577
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:24,960
somebody from understanding where and
how to get content

578
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,510
into those locations on

579
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:31,810
and still retain the cash ability that
content again

580
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:35,369
adidas attacker somebody's transfer
content for

581
00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:39,940
its any type by how do you prevent them
from actually

582
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:43,369
executing their request your origin
hitting your word

583
00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:47,490
but still maintain the usability your
infrastructure and being on the cash at

584
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:48,549
the edge

585
00:34:48,549 --> 00:34:52,720
so you know there's really easy ways you
can change content feels

586
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,270
description and all that kind of stuff
and you can randomize locations have

587
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,049
content

588
00:34:58,049 --> 00:35:01,640
the question is how do you

589
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,260
and will just go to this is an all
actually show you kinda what it looks

590
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,130
like

591
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:09,390
and how do you do that and still retain
cash ability because if you're an

592
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,540
amazing content

593
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,630
bikers same for you break cashing

594
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:18,240
if the content changes every time you
push that you break the ability Catholic

595
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,599
and so you have to have some out a band
mechanism to be able to do that

596
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:28,599
and this instance on my personal email
addresses on

597
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:33,000
on so what you can do is in an arab and
call

598
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,480
use still catch the entire page an Arab
and call you cancer

599
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,190
randomizing Pisa content this is not
necessarily the form

600
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:44,380
on location or the idea here the name
you randomized everything

601
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:48,369
you put things in different locations
you hide elements you play

602
00:35:48,369 --> 00:35:51,640
lots and lots of different mechanisms in
here and then you have a way of

603
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,200
translating that before it goes

604
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,420
or 10 and then posting the the original
content so

605
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:00,000
on the outbound the pages all at the
same but wants you

606
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,109
if they don't post the right content
backyard don't learn through

607
00:36:03,109 --> 00:36:06,270
you don't touch your that way

608
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:09,710
they can't execute brute force they can
execute

609
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:13,200
I mean these parts are fairly done they
can execute JavaScript that connects

610
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,460
making star cookies on but from a
logical perspective they have to do a

611
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,950
lot of work to be able to understand
exactly what's going on when you start

612
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:24,130
randomizing field and every element and
then being

613
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:29,089
translate that on the back becomes a
rare really really complex

614
00:36:29,089 --> 00:36:33,270
so just based on this type of attack I
targeted this this particular page on

615
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:37,779
on a protected system so that the script
that I'm in a poll

616
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:42,170
and I've got my two systems up here
there pretty much average

617
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:45,779
are right now execute my secondary
script against the protected system

618
00:36:45,779 --> 00:36:46,849
you'll see that

619
00:36:46,849 --> 00:36:50,220
one system gets seep utilization which
is our protection

620
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:53,329
mechanism and then on the other side the

621
00:36:53,329 --> 00:36:56,329
the attacker or the attack machine gets

622
00:36:56,329 --> 00:37:03,329
virtually no no impact on sorts XQ the
attack

623
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:09,619
okay so I've got a little bit of a hit
on my protection it will actually

624
00:37:09,619 --> 00:37:10,619
stabilize

625
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:13,680
after its been hit for a little bit we
were sent here

626
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,660
so it'll start going back down and so
it's its are seen as content and it

627
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,900
starts figuring out what do I need to do
with it

628
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:24,810
on in all the array controller block it
and then on the other side

629
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:28,060
not even a blip are protected machine
that because the bot

630
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:32,430
doesn't it's not sending the right
content field so it's not posting right

631
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:35,580
the right information so this is an even
hitting

632
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:39,100
the infrastructure it in that page is
trying to execute the action

633
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:43,190
our protection act and sing cannot send
me right stuff and technology through

634
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:46,609
and thats as easy in as it is so if it's
not

635
00:37:46,609 --> 00:37:49,869
in a format they were expecting all
through if it's not saying right data

636
00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:50,450
one

637
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:54,640
and there's a lot of other stuff that's
going on behind the scenes there

638
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,160
on and a area

639
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,190
as animator I think on

640
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:04,720
so so you'll be able to

641
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,840
basically randomized that content so
that if it's a scraper

642
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:11,780
and we've been seeing a lot of scrapers
as well people going in there and trying

643
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,720
to poll

644
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,170
pricing content from a bunch of sites
that's a huge problem

645
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:21,859
reason as a problem is because for all
that pricing content so if you tryna

646
00:38:21,859 --> 00:38:25,440
book hotel or something done your
research for date ranges

647
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,910
you're in a search for places

648
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:33,200
this this all hits their backend
infrastructure you're doing that to 300

649
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,240
to

650
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,609
three million times per day that's a
huge impact on their infrastructure

651
00:38:38,609 --> 00:38:40,630
because they have to search the entire
dataset

652
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:44,270
and give you that feed and some just
scraping airplane down and

653
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:51,270
and using it for some competitive and
alright so let's go back to the site

654
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:58,359
so defense is really really tough on
like I was saying that

655
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:01,730
you know they're the way that you know
we were working under

656
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:05,440
defining and putting that protection
mechanism out there is

657
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,320
you don't have to make any changes you
don't have to

658
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,369
randomized that content origin you don't
have to make those changes on your

659
00:39:12,369 --> 00:39:13,890
application infrastructure this

660
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:17,619
this protection strategy is going to do
that for you I'm and it's still gonna

661
00:39:17,619 --> 00:39:21,490
allow you to you catch that content the
edge in the network that's a very

662
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:23,340
important from adidas perspective

663
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:30,340
and also offered and performance for
users can barely see that so much

664
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:36,190
so and the protection strategies you
have to have protection on your

665
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:39,220
application where so if you're using a
while after something like that make

666
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,400
sure that its scale

667
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,740
make sure that's huge you know we're
seeing these attacks

668
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:46,770
at the application layer over 200

669
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:51,830
per second on one and so if you're not
looking at terabits a

670
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:56,740
protection then it's probably not big
enough for the scale skillful tax

671
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:01,580
even work for the government here you
stay

672
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:07,670
I large retailers banks for you where he
got work

673
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:10,930
hi I am

674
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:14,100
so financial institutions are always the
target

675
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:17,710
on governments always a target so I work
with a lot of these

676
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:21,680
these people and real time protection

677
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,720
skillful protections are important I'm
especially for

678
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,430
are our government customers think I'd

679
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:33,380
that's fun to look at on real time
always on protections

680
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:37,320
again seconds no second matter I'm if
your protection

681
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:41,400
there's I can remember provider but
there's

682
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,050
some anomaly technique that Diaz
provider uses at origin

683
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:49,490
in anybody anybody somebody and time
somebody told me that they can prevent

684
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:53,020
the of attack at word and less it's an

685
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:57,150
application resource consuming attack or
something like that that his

686
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:02,680
a load of crap on there is no amount of
skill ability that you can put your

687
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,300
origin

688
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,670
that's going to be able to prevent these
200-300

689
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:11,330
attack its its not feasible without
impacting

690
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:15,420
significantly origin and western eyes
peer something like that

691
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:19,910
unit your never gonna be able to get
that Bama question

692
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:24,850
now on so what you need is you need
somewhere defense

693
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:28,280
before you get to your datacenter or
your cloud infrastructures

694
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:33,310
something like that and it's gonna be
huge Tom and it's gonna happen quickly

695
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:35,690
if it using an ominous warning or some
pattern

696
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:39,369
base lining that takes time I could take
minutes

697
00:41:39,369 --> 00:41:44,220
it could take now it just depends on
what the traffic profile

698
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:47,890
I was looking at one solution that took
like 10 minutes to be able to baseline

699
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:48,560
traffic

700
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,880
block attacks thats

701
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,490
I don't even understand that because
you've already been impact you've

702
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:56,270
already got an outage

703
00:41:56,270 --> 00:42:00,940
I protecting multiple organs from attack
with one solution that's key

704
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:04,570
so if you're using cloud infrastructure
you got multiple data centers

705
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:07,740
you need something that can be your
kinda protect everything visibility

706
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:08,869
across all

707
00:42:08,869 --> 00:42:12,240
I don't really care which you which you
guys use but

708
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,900
it's gotta be on something that you can
protect kinda all the temperature

709
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,400
you got sitting back there sir custom

710
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,600
banks have mobile data centers

711
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:26,500
it a BS instances where you like to see
is

712
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:29,910
high-availability on your for a WSU
cloud infrastructure so you've got

713
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:32,190
multiple instances running and they're
all

714
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:35,369
haha a man you got something sitting in

715
00:42:35,369 --> 00:42:39,680
kinda in the cloud saying hey is this
guy healthy in Iraq traffic over there

716
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,980
is my protection across everything they
want an umbrella sitting on top and

717
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:43,869
you've got

718
00:42:43,869 --> 00:42:48,310
multiple things sitting underneath
servicing custom

719
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:52,890
I am but mitigation if you have bought
mitigation it has to support cash

720
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:53,440
ability

721
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,589
so if you're not catching stuff at the
engineer

722
00:42:56,589 --> 00:42:59,650
right now you're just wasting resources
on

723
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:03,119
performance is also a key aspect there
so cast over the edge

724
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,119
use butter writer you 1 but whatever
mitigation strategy

725
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:09,750
use it has to support cash in

726
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:15,220
I make inputs harder to guess a this is
a very very difficult thing to do

727
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:18,410
especially if you're if you're suffering
well for you

728
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:22,040
you've got soccer helpers working for
you this is incredibly complex and if

729
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,280
you don't do right brake

730
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,240
catching completely in your break you
could bring application

731
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,410
I block that imparts somebody send you
something that doesn't

732
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:34,710
it here too the predetermined patterns
expecting

733
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:38,730
this block

734
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:41,920
okay so but mitigation techniques we we
kind of already covered that

735
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,100
on saudi riyal a quick recap the

736
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:48,339
the stuff that we talked about so bombs
killed billy is

737
00:43:48,339 --> 00:43:51,700
extremely important use whatever
providing you want but

738
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:55,070
make sure cashing stuff at the edge make
sure your cashing

739
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:58,320
globally make sure that the protection
that you're putting on their is globally

740
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,060
scaleable

741
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:02,690
on make sure that in the terabits per
second make sure that you got

742
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:06,020
fee capping protection on olive you
stuff

743
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:10,380
so like a saying 80 yesterday their
response to

744
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:14,200
canal service and being recorded great
and so their response

745
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:18,500
to Dell services scale scale-up

746
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:22,680
the other thing on the other side of
that is sure will charger for

747
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:27,670
but yes Kayla you will be able to
satisfy that traffic load

748
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:32,420
will send you a bill later on so make
sure that whatever your gonna be using

749
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:33,010
that's going to be

750
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:37,270
defending you from that is going to have
some sort of fee protection

751
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:42,170
on the randomizing contents really hard
so

752
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:46,500
and being able to do that outer bands
were casually is extremely hard

753
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:50,080
on you know there are solutions out
there

754
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:53,990
if you want more information my email
address we can kinda

755
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:59,750
tell you what that technique looks like

758
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,630
there

759
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:11,580
there's lotsa vulnerable hosts extremely
simple scripts can cause huge impact to

760
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:12,800
customers

763
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:27,100
you know industry for months just based
on these little

764
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:31,530
scripts and twittered

765
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:34,570
up

766
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:38,300
repeated XQ data exfiltration if I get
something on a box and take your
