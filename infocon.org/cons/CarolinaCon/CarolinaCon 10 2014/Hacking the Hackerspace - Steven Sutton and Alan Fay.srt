1
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:03,710
so okay

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,900
at mining Stevenson I'm that president
preside

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,590
and is now I am a director and treasurer
a free site

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,920
so we read you

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,190
as quick as possible an explanation what
actors faces

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,480
because some you may not be familiar
with it at

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,270
reside is the one that we're interested
in in Atlanta but

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,640
akers bases in general are everywhere
and they're not necessarily affiliated

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,939
with our organization

10
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:34,139
they each have their own different style
I'll an actual universities are really

11
00:00:34,139 --> 00:00:34,629
starting

12
00:00:34,629 --> 00:00:38,319
you implement actors faces due to
Georgia Tech has won

13
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:41,699
mentions video other kind of all over
the place we wanted to talk to you a

14
00:00:41,699 --> 00:00:42,780
little bit about cars

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,819
and sorta summer things we've learned
from

16
00:00:45,819 --> 00:00:48,949
a guess and social engineering
standpoint although it's a little more

17
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:51,190
complicated

18
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:54,920
anyway at first will

19
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,079
show you what what we got going on here
so basically

20
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,190
I a hackerspace people teach classes

21
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,799
sometimes three sometimes they paid
their about any number different things

22
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,289
usually an introductory topic we have
much

23
00:01:07,289 --> 00:01:11,329
tools people use so you can but projects
together and

24
00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:14,450
you know we're gonna as that we host
events I

25
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:18,329
some free some up on paid but we have
many

26
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:21,469
manager conferences and stuff like that
at the space answer

27
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:25,750
during events we got some 3d printers &
rapid prototyping technology and stuff

28
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,350
like that

29
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,409
people can get into that there art

30
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:32,560
all over the place and and we make with
nine gina's

31
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,159
and young the very things I

32
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,659
so it's like it's like a university
basic separate you know

33
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,450
with beer if you're over on

34
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:48,079
so so free side is divided into zones

35
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,229
back tiffany's so you're staring into
our introduction zone

36
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:55,439
which welcomes people to space

37
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,350
and we have our 3d printers a as you see
we are poor

38
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:02,799
working well mostly working 30 better

39
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,840
something and sometimes and others in
their cages the context for like your

40
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,599
I am so this kinda hacking goes on in
this area because it's not all like

41
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,650
computer stuff we have a server room but
with you lot a difference to

42
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,590
we got our wallets pool their feeding
them we got

43
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,830
myself staring into 3d printer so

44
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,290
this is cool arm one thing that

45
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:29,819
have happens at a hackerspace is setting
expectations

46
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:34,030
so when people walk in the eighth
they're kinda overwhelmed by the

47
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,049
possibilities of things that they can
make

48
00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:40,379
because we have something on the order
24 two dozen zones right

49
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:44,500
yet and so people sort of like look at
all the stuff but like I could do

50
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,519
anything I you know and that's true

51
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,620
by you know expectations need to match
reality so three burners need to be

52
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,620
maintained

53
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,220
people need to understand how they work
they need them know something a little

54
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,659
bit about the toolchain

55
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:00,829
cad slicer and other things like that so

56
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:03,980
you know we have the a capacity to help
people

57
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,090
along the way but differently we need to
set the

58
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,530
we said those expectations for lease so
that up

59
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:15,250
people don't feel like were
misrepresenting exactly how much they

60
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,250
can do with

61
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:20,170
you know a compatible level about per
right in order for it to be a free

62
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,510
enough space for people to

63
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:26,049
do anything they want week can't really
manage all the services

64
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:29,939
so a lot of times it's getting outta the
people that have the knowledge

65
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:33,769
building those relationships with them
and and then getting them to teach users

66
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:34,769
self-directed

67
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:37,819
and that's kinda you harder for a lot of
people so

68
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:41,860
and so it's a volunteer member
organizations and no one gets paid no

69
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,629
one's there we don't have a staff we
have a volunteer staff

70
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:47,629
so everything has to come from

71
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:51,750
the members themselves and the
communities so as we like to say the

72
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,049
only limit is your cell

73
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:57,819
and federal and state and local law
missile okay so

74
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:01,079
but we do have appointed different
reprint so we can show people this is

75
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:01,920
what goes right

76
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,390
is wrong how how these different
concepts word we do try but

77
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:09,590
scaling kinda in thing anyway I'm the a

78
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:14,530
electronics lab so we recently got a a
six thousand dollar grant a first grant

79
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,630
to you %uh rebuild this area and

80
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:22,020
make it less wooden and the more state
of the art and include some new

81
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,800
equipment new soldering irons and that
sort of thing

82
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,940
aren't we knows another consumables
years are on the blink is that

83
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,010
yes though we got oscilloscopes and
stuff like that

84
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,450
our hardware it's all member donated so
you know it varies

85
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:39,130
in like weather in workplace

86
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,720
I am yeah I okay and then we got to the
classroom

87
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,080
right with the Wayne their I'll and

88
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,980
so c16 like so we split their class fees
fifty 50 and

89
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:55,100
so if anybody wants to teach classes
they wanna make life money you get happy

90
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,240
what people pay to take it uses twenty
dollar class injured

91
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,270
reprinting entry had like anything arm

92
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:06,350
we found a counterintuitive thing that
people imagine they'd

93
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:09,550
a free class a/b attended much more than

94
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,070
class in small the and that's not at all
true arm

95
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:16,190
if somebody pays little bit obligates
the teacher to show up and then the

96
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,320
people have a commitment

97
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,890
they actually that was weird binding a
bars com

98
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:24,030
so now we just charge up to nose for you
know the

99
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:29,340
Plaza yes a two-income twenty dollars
per three-hour class yes

100
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,650
I'll regis aren't so what yen this user

101
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,120
this is our kitchen as you can see
things happened the area

102
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,710
arm so this is summoning those are the
guys there and

103
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,000
in the kitchen and as we all are there
and we have

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,710
a meeting space where we host

105
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:51,710
different talks and you know we did 3d
printing talkin

106
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,910
whose really super weird because the guy
is hosting a talk

107
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:58,660
headed on hangouts and so one or the
other speakers was just watching from

108
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,600
above

109
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,020
want the speakers in person harkin just
nodding and it was like that

110
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,490
communication there's a area Max
Headroom moment yet

111
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:10,340
so that was a real a9 accidentally a
16-foot

112
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,700
screens okay an this isn't the shared

113
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,700
project area so up

114
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,830
well the sons or like to share resources
on all this was member donated

115
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:24,300
and it has varying degrees utility by

116
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,120
typically the way this works is members
members are able to grab anything

117
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,280
from the shelves and do anything with
them art

118
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,190
actual functioning projects whatever we
we enable that

119
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:39,470
I'll this is a brain-computer interface

120
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,500
are set up that got Timberly a

121
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,270
set up a lot about work stations we have
like for work tables in the front where

122
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,710
people can

123
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:53,060
set things up like this them so no you
on the fly projects and put put it away

124
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,380
and get others involved

125
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:58,100
yes I wanted to play with brain computer
interfaces and I wanted people that knew

126
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:58,980
what they were doing

127
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,250
to show up to them so I started a
monthly meet up

128
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,860
call brainiacs and we I found the coast
and so we do a monthly thing where we

129
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,760
play with brain computer interfaces
night trackers in

130
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,570
are tweeners and so we have all those
things talking to each other in so we

131
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,330
made a

132
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:16,410
mind-controlled infinity portal that
I'll show you later on

133
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:20,320
presentation is part of it and and some
other weird stuff so

134
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,440
you can get super weird if you can
actually get people to imagine what they

135
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,490
can do with an environment so maybe it
starts with

136
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:29,350
little building blocks and putting them
together you crazy stuff

137
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:33,070
the Media Lab we have LED strips

138
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:36,460
all around the top oven and so

139
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:40,170
weak mind control that to on

140
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:43,370
or just do 1ba when things I wanna

141
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,670
point out is our environment is fully
hackable

142
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:50,110
by the members so most the times people
work

143
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:53,200
in top-down environments just provided
for you

144
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,750
by every side you provide your own
environment and it's sort of like

145
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:01,320
an amalgamation everyone's involvements
its to try to manifest what they want to

146
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,090
create

147
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:06,830
in this space sale you can get you can
just totally repurpose an area space if

148
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,830
you get people interested in

149
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,280
we had a craft room that nobody's really
using and so

150
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,150
on this guy who does editing for some
teen vampire drama

151
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:18,430
in his day job wanted to do a podcast
and arm

152
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:22,100
maybe diversify from team we also and a

153
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,400
fully functional ham radios yeah which I
think I've gotta

154
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,150
rate gathered here so we have to two
antennas and so we have

155
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:33,500
a fully functional ham radio station
which is also the podcasting studio

156
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,870
now former craft room and so we can I
just felt that out

157
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:41,019
in you know because there were people
that were interested in

158
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:44,579
member storage everybody gets a little
bit a storage

159
00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:47,769
so people always try abuse storage in

160
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:51,399
the place and that's something we can
have to constantly work on but

161
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:54,569
you know we can accommodate everybody's
personal project

162
00:08:54,569 --> 00:08:58,139
gonna be shared space at this the
workshop not a great picture

163
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:01,370
yeah that's a better so like we have
table saws

164
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:05,689
and chop saws and planers some things
like that and

165
00:09:05,689 --> 00:09:10,379
while some scrap wood again this is just
member donated material that

166
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:14,120
is available for use feel free incoming

167
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,139
icon someone you know yeah.so I'm

168
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:20,139
you know a lot of people do woodworking
and that's their

169
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:23,800
you know happen entry into the space we
get a budget and that

170
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:30,290
that manual brake for bending sheet
metal and scrolls on a drill press

171
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:34,209
we have a laser cutter right which does
really cool prototyping stuff

172
00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:37,279
I a laid back type 2 lays in a mill now

173
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,250
I am and so we have a lot of networking
stuff into a basin

174
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,910
a welder in a kiln

175
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,360
foundry Ford whenever on

176
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,380
and much other stuff sometimes people
take a cardboard there were like no

177
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,330
shame on you

178
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,839
and then there's this somewhere so that
I find you

179
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:58,339
yeah but I yes oh om

180
00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:02,470
you know I its kinda it's a fun
environment like the reason why we have

181
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,980
so many different things going on there
is because

182
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,830
we want people to barter their skills
with each other so everybody comes in

183
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:09,760
and does something

184
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,180
am and the mat know what it is that they
have the advantage over you know

185
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,529
over the other people but the guy who
brought in the lathe and brought in the

186
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:19,080
mill and does all the metalworking

187
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,390
really wants to know about automation
controllers deadline designs on

188
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,670
fabrication and he can

189
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:27,790
make them do stuff and so that's what he
does is he teaches everybody male

190
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,459
working and then he learned how to make
our

191
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:33,310
are tweeners work wanted the when the
first things that we

192
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:37,820
did when we sorted took over the space
and got into a leadership role

193
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:43,339
was do several social engineering
tactics to slowly try to ship the

194
00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:44,459
courtroom the space

195
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:48,180
so wanted the core values that we
emphasize with humility

196
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,290
so that you could actually show up to
the space

197
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:55,740
not know something about how I X a
copter works

198
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,120
and that is totally OK because
everybody's gonna figure it out together

199
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,000
we're all gonna back on this as a team

200
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,130
which is really cool because we have
people come in there like I'm the best

201
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,200
at what I do and

202
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,010
were like okay collect as a foot surgeon
up you know one up him

203
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:12,730
and I we'll see how that that were
temporary so like

204
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:16,420
because everybody has mic skills then
you have to come in with an open mind is

205
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,779
no idea how the castle arm so

206
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:23,870
I anyway at why the first project that
we did not show people

207
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:27,279
sorta 10 said get a win right

208
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,690
was a hex Cap term we built that and we
fluid

209
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,040
and crashed in I am the and

210
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,060
so we decide to do something easier I'm
so

211
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:41,649
I we we didn't learn to solder thing
where we basically milled out the

212
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:42,820
circuit boards

213
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,940
and made the actual circuits and then
talk budget

214
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,910
people how to solder at at Maker Faire
and I was fun on

215
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,560
to these are all projects that somebody
had the idea and they decided to get a

216
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,040
bunch other people interested in

217
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,540
as if you have an idea and you don't get
much other people interested in you end

218
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,670
up doing the whole thing

219
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:04,800
I so you know them at we built an
off-road wheelchair

220
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,329
for a friend of ours for Albany so we
took at

221
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:12,400
really horrible zero turn lawn mower and
we add

222
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,180
but blinking LED is on it painted like a
Mario Kart situation

223
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,480
and boom there you go so that was a lot
of fun

224
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,610
on at so we did a fundraiser for that
and get there are paid for

225
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,610
and is really cool we have a paranoia
board in space

226
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:30,540
that anybody can contribute to to unlock
the secrets of the

227
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,959
arm reptilian alien Billy Minardi that
her I

228
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:37,350
we know to be running our government and
everything around us

229
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,500
at all times ISO you can see Betty Page
up there

230
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,000
yet that anyway Wed is a

231
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,430
oh yeah I smile yeah my bad I get
estimate is that yeah

232
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:51,410
11 really um but yes 0

233
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:55,980
so that their Tom there is a dude in our
space that has launched several kick

234
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,100
starters and and runs a couple companies

235
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,550
and benefits from that environment
because he knows how to use it so it's

236
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,880
not exclusively like you only have to do

237
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,970
open source nonprofit stuff you can do
this kinda stuff

238
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:11,480
it's you it's a game like minimus know
with this %uh this is the box so

239
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,510
up yet but divides yes at

240
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:19,100
push the button at your own you know
right taking your life in your hands

241
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,970
anyway this does something and we're
very excited about it

242
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:26,980
a so I am anyway so that's a thing

243
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,380
and he's got his own setup at home so he
his setup is way better than are so he

244
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,790
comes there to talk to us

245
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:37,070
the maybe drink beer and not necessarily
to use all the equipment but he brings

246
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,350
on information with them in

247
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,449
sometime tires people to hang out
there's that's cool

248
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:47,010
I this is a you're going to be um this
was an interesting idea that we had

249
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:51,490
so we found out later on that class
series don't work really well

250
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,920
unless you actually do like an
interesting series so

251
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,360
the theory behind a series not the
reality

252
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,530
there behind it was that they would be a
six-part journey into constructing a

253
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,089
custom

254
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:06,420
3d printer so each of these parts were
printed out

255
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:10,459
and during the class on the instructor
showed how they would be put together

256
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:13,839
and this was the printer at the end of
the class

257
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,939
excellent yeah

258
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:21,329
money will send I hey actually on that
point

259
00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:25,280
um the at the social engineering talk a
last night because made to that

260
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,689
he's talking about visualized story and
kinesthetic learners

261
00:14:28,689 --> 00:14:32,010
I and so yeah it's it's cool to decode

262
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:35,170
you know what color somebody isn't
speaker money level but

263
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:38,220
what you can do if you're teaching
somebody and you want them didn't fully

264
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,380
understand what it is that you're
talking about is you can do something

265
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,010
called

266
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:44,150
you where you tell them what you're
gonna do you in the new show them

267
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:47,500
you doing in the new make them do it net
takes it through auditory

268
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,279
visual and kinesthetic you make sure
that they understand what it is you

269
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,260
talking about

270
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,380
I am just assign anyway akers

271
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,660
willie mention not I am yeah

272
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,910
so who worked hard margin yeah

273
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:04,380
oh okay so this is a full om

274
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:08,209
iight so mu you know

275
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:11,730
have one of our members basically did he
published

276
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:15,709
as a medical research where he 3d
printed a fight did not know anything

277
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:19,230
or much about 3d printing came into the
space and said hey

278
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:22,620
I'm for surgeon and I'm interested in 3d
printing and I think

279
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:27,370
the if I we look at a couple a bone
disorders where they present differently

280
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,730
in each patient you have to

281
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:31,740
make a custom a syriza

282
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,449
I guess it's an enclosure gonna put
behold the bones in place after the

283
00:15:35,449 --> 00:15:36,750
surgery and all that stuff

284
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,740
what if we just 3d printed their foot
and then we did all the surgical

285
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,819
fixtures in all planning on that

286
00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:46,079
and as he did that I think that took the
surgery time my eight hours the to

287
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,100
I am so cuz they were doing 3d images
I'll

288
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,699
doll dresses I thank you nom it is a
published papers

289
00:15:52,699 --> 00:15:56,279
yeah we're the only and other under
space published in a medical journal

290
00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:00,770
yet the name the the name is a total
nightmare I have it happen

291
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:04,140
I guess it didn't import the we don't
have any or home noted

292
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:08,170
does our gather our surgical photos on
our blog in San people like

293
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:12,050
other all know it then like so it's
really bad and people better

294
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:16,620
the computers but I am anyway so that
happened

295
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,140
this is so this is a project that at
that Nick and I

296
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:24,819
work done Nick a who's the surgeon is
the best person to hackerspace thing

297
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:25,620
ever

298
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,360
I am becas he's just excited the as
ideas and he

299
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,910
follows through on a min he gets people
involved in a min that's what he does

300
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:37,650
and so he and I have a paper on the way
to publishing I where we basically

301
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:40,779
did this horrible set up with books and

302
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:44,120
at looks horrible but basically what
this is

303
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,339
a a fixture to hold somebody's heads
table in front of this camera which is

304
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:50,520
doing I tracking and so it's looking at

305
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:54,470
where they're looking at on an image I
and

306
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:58,819
recording that into and analysis
environment that we can later go back in

307
00:16:58,819 --> 00:17:02,410
scan over and so what we did was we
looked at that

308
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:05,530
gaze patterns across I series

309
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:09,360
have 30 x-ray images and had surgical
residents

310
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,740
and surgeons with over seven years
experience

311
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,480
scan across and then we took all that
data in

312
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,540
and made some conclusions across it says
that this is this is an expert you like

313
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,870
but a bike at this and this is a
resident is the call my god I hope I

314
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:24,589
don't fail

315
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:27,880
you know I have a look at the whole
thing in like major every

316
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,100
it so I had so they're like obvious
differences but also some

317
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,210
some experts have bad habits and on it's
hard to tell if they're using the

318
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,270
peripheral vision to take

319
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:39,400
in a bunch staffer there you know
whatever so there's a lot of stuff that

320
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,640
we're gonna do after this

321
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,580
at probably the next phase of this
project is we're gonna take a brain

322
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,050
computer interface and put it on
somebody's head while they're doing the

323
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,600
scan and so we can know their

324
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,860
levels of attention and focus is this
getting across the image gets super

325
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,650
weird

326
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,309
I am so we just try to make things as
weird as possible when we're there

327
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:58,590
and in that vein this is AI

328
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,909
infinity a mirror that we bill for
alchemy

329
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:06,710
I and so I have this is the design this
is the prototype on the laser cutter we

330
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,270
did a fundraiser around this

331
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:12,250
is Kevin Edward the tabloid wild crazy
guys

332
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,980
that helped us build a prototype which
we were like oh my god like that

333
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:20,710
and then as it is the final thing and us
so that it on and then we hooked it up

334
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,750
to bring computer database
mind-controlled

335
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,510
so it's way early rainbow tunnel to
forever date you can push on the acrylic

336
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:29,260
and it works the tunnel and then you can
control it with your mind in a bunch of

337
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:29,929
people

338
00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:33,370
on acid at Albany were like oh my god
this is the truth in everything

339
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:37,350
and so so that your or they just worked
and

340
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,590
the other word there was some twerking
there is number reporting incidents that

341
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,889
we had an old

342
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:46,380
no we don't applaud for twerking well
sign a prenup thats

343
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,669
we made a note working sign so hum but
it was

344
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:52,860
we we fix that but I we have a
quadrocopter

345
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,440
in addition to the ex captors ways you
to fly play around with panda

346
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,540
so we have a member who's getting the my
own thing

347
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:03,620
I I guess hasn't released yet I don't
know II beta

348
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:07,360
little wristband that checks no reads
basically a

349
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,850
on electrical impulses the same way that
the brain computer interfaces dubin

350
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:15,220
with you know muscle and read all your
gestures and Stephanie wants to control

351
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,010
this

352
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:19,649
with one and I think he's got some kinda
can an idea worked out that he's gonna

353
00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:21,090
control with the other to

354
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:24,540
on that can be awful arm I

355
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,929
sigh I told him to incorporate a
brain-computer interface now

356
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:31,860
by I am I think it needs one because be
loses focus knees like

357
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:35,570
you know controller thing is a call hey
and then it like goes and bombs a

358
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,919
a you know that would be bad yeah I want
one thing with a

359
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:42,060
when you're doing a custom AXA copter
make sure you read

360
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:45,690
all the documentation and make sure you
calibrate it because the

361
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:49,350
a common problem is if you do not put
the fail-safe in

362
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:53,060
and you just go for brought all it will
just keep on going

363
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,940
and it will not stop yeah it'll get
stuck in all product up it so that's the

364
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,300
thing

365
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:01,050
didn't happen ours but I'd like to chase
goats and turkeys reconcile

366
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:04,850
arm so we're we we do give a flying fuck

367
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:07,860
I am and and so this is a I

368
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,169
plane that you brought in he was like
this is a wreck

369
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:14,139
piece a crap and you guys can probably
pick secure the hackers which never

370
00:20:14,139 --> 00:20:17,200
happens everybody brings broken stuff
like in

371
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,899
by I but dont ever bring a CRT to
hackerspace because

372
00:20:20,899 --> 00:20:26,090
and 9 its not K and a way on the tables
on a couple

373
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:29,649
are pieces of equipment he made a phone
weighing out a bit and then flew in

374
00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:32,919
is that crashed in is really
disappointed on

375
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:36,210
so this is this is what we wanna talk
about in terms like at

376
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:40,970
that social engineering political aspect
this is our charter membership over time

377
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:44,530
so we use this to understand were here
want you explain

378
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:49,679
what we in your not so we sorta came
into the space and gone and the

379
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:50,880
leadership

380
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,240
this point and

381
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,370
we did such an interesting cultural
change the lotto

382
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:01,800
funny things happen very quickly we had
fourteen members

383
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,899
and we just started really rallying
people to do

384
00:21:04,899 --> 00:21:08,290
public demands and tell people about the
space and

385
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:12,940
at the same time set expectations don't
try to over hype something

386
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,230
and really bring on people a divers tell

387
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,880
you gonna make approachable rioted
intimidating to be in a place yet to be

388
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,330
so

389
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:23,630
raised so you Stephen and I have
different styles

390
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:26,669
arm so I'm kinda like the I guess

391
00:21:26,669 --> 00:21:30,360
like the good cop I guess here the human
ear damage

392
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,139
yeah I'm and the shaman the space for
some reason people come to me with other

393
00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:35,389
personal problems and

394
00:21:35,389 --> 00:21:39,080
show the redemption hacking but a

395
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:43,240
basically a what I do is my approach is

396
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,340
I listened very carefully first and
foremost to

397
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,490
what a person does I'll

398
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:53,370
in terms of work yeah but really what
what they're passionate about like

399
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:58,100
kind of side projects to work on it home
I pay very close attention to you

400
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:02,139
or the interests of our and than what
they seek to do with the space

401
00:22:02,139 --> 00:22:06,350
and sometimes we have people who are
really engaged at home and they just

402
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,129
come the space to have a beer

403
00:22:08,129 --> 00:22:11,280
you know socialize and so that's cool
and i can spin them into different

404
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,830
it is that place that you can go to wear
like everybody else in your life is so

405
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,330
tired of hearing you talk about this
thing that you're into you

406
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:20,679
and then you know they're like oh my god
how you can talk about this again okay

407
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:24,490
yeah when you come here everybody's home
and it's weird okay I didn't even know

408
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:25,480
there are you

409
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,720
so I call these like get the badge I
moments so I you know a guy comes to me

410
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,909
and you'd like

411
00:22:30,909 --> 00:22:35,090
you know he so sad because he has a
toaster that can talk to the internet

412
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:38,830
and you know I'm like well here's a
friend has written software that can

413
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,500
talk to your toaster and he's like

414
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,899
all and then they get married I'll you
but lay

415
00:22:43,899 --> 00:22:47,179
is a yet exit there's two things going
on a star

416
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:50,980
the green is awesome because it's serve
a success story but the rat is

417
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,560
month-over-month so we have falling off
a little bit

418
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:59,429
here lately on so we we trying to figure
out where we're always trying new

419
00:22:59,429 --> 00:23:03,250
different things because we have no idea
what we're doing arm

420
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:06,379
and I think that's the case for most
will be real engineering degree

421
00:23:06,379 --> 00:23:09,450
anything sorta 3 plateaus right and yet

422
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:12,870
I i think is a good time to talk about
I'll

423
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:16,230
Rick fall up it's pop singer that higher

424
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:19,310
party guy wrote a book that free ebook
course call

425
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:22,480
us warm wise and he talks about three
critical numbers

426
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,850
7:30 in a 150 and 150 is Dunbar's number

427
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:30,139
refers to tribal organization arm

428
00:23:30,139 --> 00:23:35,220
7:30 are sort of like smaller subset
seven is the number of people that

429
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,840
can come to consensus and then after a
all bets are off

430
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,379
saddam we have six people on board yes
so usually

431
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:46,320
you know we try to keep the core
leadership around six or seven

432
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,129
and then 30 is the number of people in a
group that all know each other very well

433
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:54,450
and so past that number as you can see

434
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:59,010
we were sorta plateauing on our way to
30 and we had to rebuild

435
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:02,659
relationships assorted divide the space
up a little bit so that we can get

436
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:03,850
another group

437
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:07,720
about 30 to come together and

438
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,530
organize a space that way and so that
that takes a lot of time and effort that

439
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,120
takes a lot

440
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,710
listening to everybody and making sure
that you can create those connections

441
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:20,840
between people that foster that growth
and then

442
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,129
foster that interesting projects and
that's what so

443
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:27,830
the the the social engineering talk last
night focused a lot on

444
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:31,169
pacing yourself with someone naturally
and basing their

445
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:35,240
their speedo at the way that they speak
in that kinda stuff

446
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,240
and that's good if you're if you're com

447
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,649
trying to gain you know gain trust to
gain access and I can I think but if

448
00:24:41,649 --> 00:24:42,090
you're

449
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:44,879
building a long-term relationship that's
called leveling in that happens

450
00:24:44,879 --> 00:24:46,370
naturally is you

451
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:50,030
get to know somebody in are just so stay
open minded to what they're doing

452
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,399
so you can try to learn and mechanically
do all those things and you're gonna

453
00:24:53,399 --> 00:24:56,210
forget some other man then it's going to
look really weird because you're going

454
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:57,440
to be doing all the action

455
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,490
have another facial expressions or
whatever and they're gonna be at home I

456
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:01,750
got you can I

457
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:07,600
strange up so but leveling happens
naturally and and the reason why

458
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,540
those social engineering techniques are
all part of a body research is because

459
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,830
I'm it because it does happen naturally
and we understand it and we

460
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:18,510
are receptive to that and so you kinda
need to create an experience with

461
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,830
different people and anchor them

462
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:23,070
in the space or in the community because

463
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:27,100
this isn't gaining one time trust her
access I what you're trying to do is do

464
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:27,350
you

465
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:31,889
trying to create an area where you have
the opportunity to explore anything

466
00:25:31,889 --> 00:25:35,540
yet so in the in the social engineering
talk the talk about tinkering

467
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:40,370
people two concepts and ideas so that
was part of the reason for creating that

468
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:43,139
sounds as we anchor people to the idea
of

469
00:25:43,139 --> 00:25:47,379
oh this is an area of common activities
as the 3d printers &

470
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:52,010
you know if somebody comes to me arm
that doesn't quite get the humility

471
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:52,990
value yet

472
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:56,800
which is kinda awesome because they show
up in there like I'm the 3d printer

473
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,580
expert I'm like cool will you

474
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:02,300
repair all these machines for you know
now you are the leader

475
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:06,950
this zone and its awesome and some
people really do

476
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:10,060
like take to that yeah I am so mean it

477
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,409
you can go to play with different people
styles but anyway

478
00:26:13,409 --> 00:26:16,470
we we wanted to show this concept you
guys in

479
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,690
add get you may be a little bit
interested in it because

480
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:23,000
I social engineering is really hard and

481
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,230
the dude that was talking last night had
several decades of experience

482
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:30,840
its really difficult to do and so he
environment where you can explore that

483
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,800
no risk

484
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,960
and that goes the same with skills and
different other things right you want to

485
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,230
expose yourself to an environment where
there are people who know what they're

486
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:37,929
doing

487
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:42,090
in specific areas and then there's no
risk failure and if you do something

488
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:45,389
doesn't work out you clean up your mess
from the space

489
00:26:45,389 --> 00:26:49,250
and leave it the way the founder and
then you know trace amounts

490
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:56,230
them now the questions

491
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:59,779
16 yeah we haven't started mom

492
00:26:59,779 --> 00:27:02,940
with when the number was lower we
started with zero

493
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,159
and then we increased om to 16 percent

494
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:11,029
and we have a female doctor now as well
that's something that's like barry

495
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:14,580
personal important to me that we
increased the diversity in the space

496
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,669
that way

497
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:21,169
I'll and you know that something that
you don't see very much often a lot of

498
00:27:21,169 --> 00:27:22,309
different hackerspace is

499
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:26,460
and the approach you have to take with
it is a very careful one

500
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,799
and it has to be considerate and sincere
because

501
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:35,020
yet

502
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,440
well the the diversity message in
general

503
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,130
affects how the the community gets
together because one we didn't want to

504
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:42,910
specifically

505
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:46,430
say okay we want to make the place you
know nicer

506
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:49,610
for you know female specifically so we
do have

507
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:53,770
policies we create policies on sexual
harassment thing is that we do a

508
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:54,400
foursome

509
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,390
by the diversity message in general is
we want this to be a place where anybody

510
00:27:58,390 --> 00:27:58,950
can become

511
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:03,720
anybody from any background it so it was
not specifically adding that

512
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,370
like inclusion and diversity that made
it more comfortable for everybody

513
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:11,210
it's just that we don't have a %uh yeah
value the hell even that you have to

514
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:12,470
start with the value

515
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:16,670
and it really after you start with the
value and you make that a Korean you

516
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,990
show people that it's a core and you
mean it

517
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:22,550
when you say that kinda behaviors and
tolerated here then

518
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:26,760
good behaviors follow more diversity
followers and it just kinda builds on

519
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,340
itself

520
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:30,390
and you know we do occasionally try to

521
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:33,800
trying to nudge people towards more
leadership so we can have diversity in

522
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,670
our leadership

523
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:39,210
I'll by you know I'd I mean we didn't
really have to it candor issues a

524
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:39,990
flagrant

525
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:43,670
director to undergo yes arm and so

526
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:47,480
yeah I its it's tough

527
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,360
and it's tough to help people understand
that but one way that you can make it

528
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,520
make sense to people is

529
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,120
we don't want diversity in space to be
politically correct or anything like

530
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:55,690
that

531
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:59,490
when you have diversity in an
organization or in a group of people you

532
00:28:59,490 --> 00:28:59,900
get

533
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,000
robust ideas right you get people coming
from different angles different

534
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,390
perspectives and its smart

535
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:08,010
to have people like that around when
you're working on projects are working

536
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:08,380
on

537
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:12,270
marketing to broader demographic than
you

538
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:16,060
personally understand that kinda stuff
so it makes sense as an organization

539
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:19,150
do that anyway the same as it makes
sense to split up into different zones

540
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,390
and have different technologies

541
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:26,840
in questions good we didn't

542
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:31,020
nom the organization owns it it was
founded up four years ago

543
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,200
and or actually by almost 2009

544
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,650
yet by and so yeah I was it was founded
the space is just a rented

545
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:41,650
warehouse unit in the west and I'll

546
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:45,430
and yeah it's just 30 been like three
cycles leadership

547
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:48,950
generate that much reason anywhere else

548
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:53,100
alright

549
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:53,540
thank you
