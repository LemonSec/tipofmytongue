1
00:00:04,109 --> 00:00:05,150
things everybody so

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:08,950
I i cant really introduce myself any
better convicted are ready so

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:13,240
want to get into it so this is how to
make money fast using a poon PBX

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,000
on you need to take any notes all my
slides are

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,900
published on get Harbin you're all be at
the end so

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,070
there are no buts there's no videos

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,150
there's no in from Marshalls no
high-pressure sales no investment

8
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:28,869
required

9
00:00:28,869 --> 00:00:32,509
so want to show you today is once you
pony PBX

10
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:36,329
what the mystical question mark years
when you actually need to do

11
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:39,780
to turn a profit I'm I can say about
myself

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,909
you can look me up on line so

13
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:46,850
a quick the mandatory disclaimer in
legalese cuz I'm here

14
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:51,010
are speaking on behalf my company these
views in in opinions are my own

15
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,959
and don't represent anybody else okay so

16
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:59,329
are a lot of people know that yes you
can crack PBX is

17
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:02,399
said packing has been around for quite a
while but the

18
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,000
missing element here is you know when
you actually do you want to track the

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,509
PBX in such as making free phone calls
right

20
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:12,990
arm you can actually make money fast and

21
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,039
it's to the point now that you know it's
it's a multi-billion-dollar

22
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:21,759
problem the FBI is finally taking notice
and trying to help private industry do

23
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:22,649
something about it

24
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:27,750
on you know losses are now to the tuna
for work 46.3 billion dollars

25
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,229
and this is strictly based on reporting
from

26
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:35,820
are carriers from service providers like
Verizon and AT&T in level three no's

27
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,999
those types of people so were completely
discounting

28
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:44,679
some others the losses that might
actually be experienced by private

29
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:46,249
industry that are not reported

30
00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:49,280
so it's probably way bigger than that
some people say it is high

31
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,390
eighty million dollars law enforcement's
finally taken notice and actually I

32
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,780
think it was November last year the FBI
actually added

33
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,999
a to people to their you know

34
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:04,009
cyber most-wanted in there

35
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:07,229
strictly guys that were doing Voice over
IP

36
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:12,299
fraud alright so here's our story goes
today

37
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:16,180
I'm gonna cover a little bit have how we
got here why we have such a big problem

38
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,629
on why the bad stuff is so easy you know
show you very briefly how to crack sip

39
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:22,250
extensions for those view that

40
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,970
me may not be familiar with it on name a
look at how PBX cracking actually

41
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:27,640
happens

42
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,620
who's doing it I at least from my US
centric viewpoint and

43
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,480
if you have a crack PBX actually how to
use it how to make money fast

44
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:43,480
so CliffsNotes history lesson modern
offices right everybody knew the phone

45
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:48,620
arm we we started seeing phones
appearing on everybody's desk but it was

46
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,870
very expensive

47
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,480
because everybody needed a hard wire
from the phone company

48
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,019
and those those extensions were really
not in use very often

49
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:01,220
so people start moving to a PBX system

50
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:05,140
private branch exchange it was just a
way to share your limited

51
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,879
phone resources and take advantage of
that are

52
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,290
you know high number lines it was on you
so you only have to pay for

53
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,769
24 lines and phone company but you have
several hundred SS

54
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:18,849
also allows people to call another
inside your company

55
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:23,870
and you don't have to go out to the to
the actual phone company unfortunately

56
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,269
this storm on wires lot maintenance and
for

57
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:30,950
the port cellco guy like rolling around
in closets and stuff like that

58
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:35,390
so Along Came I P and we

59
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:39,420
put everything in the meat-grinder love
IP including voice over IP

60
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,129
we start connecting it to the Internet
on

61
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:46,819
first popular with h323 and

62
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:49,959
now the voice over IP landscape is
primarily

63
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:55,420
I dominated by the SIP signaling
protocol in RTP for carrying Voice

64
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,859
what's interesting is that

65
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:03,219
the service providers are now appearing
actually mentoring for several years

66
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:06,650
strictly over IP RTM

67
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:10,769
the old the old are you know copper
links in that for handing traffic

68
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:12,930
between different carriers is pretty
much dead

69
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:16,019
and the FCC is actually pushing the
service writers

70
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:22,530
to move towards a pure IP network

71
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,960
alright so the move to an IP based PBX

72
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,290
you know there's there's a lot of
motivations for businesses to

73
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,750
22 to do this especially simplicity

74
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:37,880
cost savings and features and when you
have an IP PBX you can now choose for

75
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,220
your phone company is

76
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,110
so I can get a what's called a SIP trunk
here's a connection to you

77
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,920
any number up phone companies they're
willing to offer you

78
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,890
I you know a connection over the
Internet they may come in and drop a

79
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,450
dedicated circuit with a dedicated

80
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,850
router whatever their business model is
on

81
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:58,230
but you can also hook up to cloud
services your your desk set

82
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,330
might actually go out to register with a
cloud service somewhere so you have a

83
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,000
virtual PBX

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,540
arm unfortunately when you can act

85
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,390
that's where you run into problems

86
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:14,770
so let's take a look at the SIP protocol
itself

87
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:19,240
sip is used for signaling the the voice
over IP sessions

88
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,440
arm it can be interested in can be sent
over TLS

89
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,740
by there's not very many people that are
doing it because you know

90
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,540
certificates are complicated I you can't
necessarily nailed down a standard have

91
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,720
you know how you're going to negotiate
this connection so

92
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,080
hey it's all clear text right so I mean
you look at this looks

93
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,640
a little bit like HTTP rate that's

94
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,190
it's a extensible so you've got a bunch
of different

95
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,350
are headers you know

96
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,450
buyer from to you all this and you'll
see

97
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:56,270
a wall it was not shown in the invite
we'll see response codes very much like

98
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:01,410
are like HTTP send an invite you get a
200 OK or 180 ringing or something like

99
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,620
that back

100
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,980
so obviously this means that if it's
flying back and forth in cleartext

101
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:11,010
you can intercepting your data from it
you can maybe modify it wallets in

102
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,090
flight

103
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,160
and arm if you get the media

104
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,190
information here STP maybe you can
figure out how to insert yourself

105
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,530
in that conversation or recording media
or

106
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:26,370
you know do do whatever you will with
this so you're revealing an awful lot of

107
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,750
information

108
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,240
by using clear texture

109
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,300
so in Carolina const 7

110
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,790
there was a talk by Chris to Dorsey
about SSH on the part I and II

111
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,910
went home from that got pretty excited
about what you know what can I do that

112
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:43,660
was a

113
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,680
there was an interesting talk so I
decided all set up a simply pop

114
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,560
and I was lucky enough that wanna my
customers time was a major

115
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,480
University on the east coast who was
also very interested in this

116
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,040
the had no expertise but tons resources

117
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,270
in hook up to you both internet one
internet to and say

118
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:06,050
what will set up a bunch of VM's for you
knock yourself out

119
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:10,770
so I've been running this honey pot I
for the last three years collecting data

120
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:14,550
are getting no intelligence to build
into you

121
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:18,260
some other products that I are used to
support and

122
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:22,320
I used iodine it dining and which is a
low interaction honey pot

123
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,500
and you know thinking I was going to be
thorough I set up

124
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,380
TCP DPT last you know TFTP basically the
whole gambit I love

125
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,520
different protocols that set to run over
arm but in you know

126
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,540
because we were really working with any
funding

127
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,390
if you compromise my honey pot it really
can go anywhere so you can really make a

128
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,090
free phone call anywhere

129
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:46,450
but the intelligence that we're able to
collect was

130
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:50,100
reflective ok what the attackers were
actually trying to do in order to

131
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,230
compromise your system

132
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:57,240
you know given that I figured people
were gonna be intelligent about

133
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,340
you know where this where these IP is is
you know

134
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:03,420
physically are or where where the IP is

135
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,960
is registered to whose who the IP is
registered to

136
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,940
that they would figure out how it's this
university so

137
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,070
I'm gonna try to figure out you know how
I can skim them like

138
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:19,170
worst financial aid bursar security so I
set up all these extensions on the PBS

139
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:24,070
are or the fictitious PBS thinking you
know maybe we'll get some good data that

140
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:28,020
unfortunately that didn't really work

141
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,510
are the surprising part was there were
no attacks a TCP

142
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:36,699
no attack city last I've never in three
years seen anything hit my tee FTP port

143
00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:41,259
arm and they were only looking for three
digit extensions

144
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:44,879
which three digit extensions are the
most common

145
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,959
are set up if you're looking at us of
PBX like asterisk

146
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,879
outta the box its defaulting to three
digit extensions

147
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:55,899
arm and the top tool that was in use

148
00:08:55,899 --> 00:08:59,600
didn't even provide back any feedback to
the user that

149
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,750
it found the PBX unless you are using
three did

150
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,449
three digit extensions so for those of
you who support

151
00:09:06,449 --> 00:09:10,629
our voice over IP systems take that one
heart if you got three digit extensions

152
00:09:10,629 --> 00:09:14,800
get rid of them

153
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,639
alright so from the pot from the
perspective of the honeypot

154
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:22,949
what actual set methods do we see so
that's so sad method

155
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:26,720
is are the typeof message you'll have
things like

156
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,029
are options which are basic health check
saying

157
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:34,399
hair you there what use would you
support

158
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,610
and the response back in the PBX is
supposed to be you know i i Sport

159
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,970
you know the these particular things
bring during media in

160
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:46,470
on this is how I like to to send
ringtones and things like that

161
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:50,029
a the next thing that will seize an
invite which is basically

162
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:54,490
hey establish a call to this number

163
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,620
and in the last is are register message
so you may send an invite

164
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,910
but because you're not a registered user
you haven't sent username and password

165
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,389
in the system doesn't know about you

166
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:07,709
you can't really make any calls so the
register is here's my extension

167
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:12,240
here's my password I you know put me in
your directory and you start making

168
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,589
phone calls now

169
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:17,589
in there are actually fourteen different
set methods but just these three are

170
00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:19,759
really the only ones that you'll see

171
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:23,120
on in insert cracking

172
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,350
so what actually happens

173
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:32,269
the first thing is an attacker will send
an options message this is basic your

174
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:33,360
basic and mapped

175
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,029
I skin up the internet they're just
looking for

176
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:41,819
are you know any IP is that are out
there that are hosting a SIP service

177
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:45,800
so the Senate options messaging get a
response and when they get a response

178
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,259
been all send an initial probe and this
is I miss you try to make a call

179
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:54,439
to see if perhaps its wide open
misconfigured what have you

180
00:10:54,439 --> 00:10:57,519
if it works a great they're gonna start
sending traffic

181
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,689
most cases it doesn't so then they start
sending register messages

182
00:11:01,689 --> 00:11:05,019
and bill try multiple passwords in its

183
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:09,249
purely burn brute force one 100 101 102

184
00:11:09,249 --> 00:11:12,499
remember all the way through their
password worst usually in america and

185
00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:14,730
then you might see them switching back
and forth to

186
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,740
to taxed and so okay fineee

187
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,240
the figure out the password is 102 the
next thing they're gonna do is try to

188
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,430
make a call to a test number

189
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:27,759
and that test numbers usually a burner
phone

190
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,600
or maybe another boy extension that they
crack somewhere else

191
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,999
so they actually know this is this is
like the verification check

192
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:39,980
they actually know that this thing can
make calls and and get somewhere

193
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:44,689
and in the case of my honey pot because
it didn't have a truck hooked up to it

194
00:11:44,689 --> 00:11:47,889
rightly the calls were going nowhere but
they didn't know that

195
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:51,269
there was no trunk they disfigured why
didn't get the right pre-fixed

196
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:54,589
calls so keep your

197
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:57,769
on and all trip the

198
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:01,459
I'm mistaken a in front of it maybe
that's what I need to do to get an

199
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:02,569
outside line

200
00:12:02,569 --> 00:12:07,209
then they try 9 and hey magically that
works so I can now make

201
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:11,970
make outbound calls

202
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:15,220
so recent example this is taken right
from the

203
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:20,069
the dialogues in the honeypot you'll see
that

204
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:23,129
multiple invite messages and in this
case

205
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:27,559
the IP address was registered to
palestinian Internet services

206
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:31,290
the creepy or up this is you know you

207
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:38,290
PBX I'm not gonna go through to work it
up

208
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:42,240
that's nine so what you gonna do you go
to Palestine in you know demand your

209
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:42,720
money

210
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,059
it's not gonna happen rate and you can
see the prefix here

211
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:52,939
on 972 is actually owned by John Wall
sailor in the Palestinian territories

212
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:56,019
on I wouldn't call this number for you
by the way

213
00:12:56,019 --> 00:12:59,720
very expensive so

214
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,160
obviously one of the things that you can
get from from my running high part is

215
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,120
figuring out

216
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,680
you know what are the actual tools that
people are using in again

217
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,559
just like arm the

218
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:14,829
you know just just like the IP addresses

219
00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:17,670
these attackers don't even really care
it seems if you know what they're

220
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,749
running so

221
00:13:18,749 --> 00:13:23,559
sit vicious I mean it its has a a
default user agent string it says

222
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:25,689
friendly dash scanner

223
00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:29,189
and you'll see it show all the time now

224
00:13:29,189 --> 00:13:34,079
obviously my honey pot data is based on
a very US centric view

225
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:39,829
and I talk to other other VoIP security
professionals internationally in a

226
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:43,420
they see slightly different things based
on you know where their attackers are

227
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,649
coming from and where they're based

228
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:48,899
but for the most part Sid Vicious has
remained

229
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:52,059
are since it came out I think for five
years ago

230
00:13:52,059 --> 00:13:56,269
you know the top tool for cracking boy
extensions

231
00:13:56,269 --> 00:14:00,269
arm the interesting part was idea to
talk similar to this

232
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:03,869
at the communications fraud control
sociation last year

233
00:14:03,869 --> 00:14:06,949
and at that point I'm ninety-nine
percent a

234
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:11,029
all the hits oh my honey pot were coming
from Sid Vicious now

235
00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:15,689
it has fallen to what's at seventy-six
percent

236
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:19,369
and this backs if user agent represents
the ball

237
00:14:19,369 --> 00:14:24,410
the the increase in in different tools
our backs if user agent is

238
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:27,559
just the user agent string that's that
sent by

239
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:31,800
a particular Voice over IP API that's
commercially available

240
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,850
so people are are actually buying a SIP
API

241
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,879
and writing quick scripts that will just
do all their scanning and torrential

242
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:38,509
cracking

243
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:42,600
for them our city lies another example
one of those

244
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,999
and Dom this this one actually cracks me
up I mean

245
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:52,230
are you can get a number of different
Fri Sep clients but for some reason

246
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:56,939
there's an ecosystem love these these
with Packers that exchange tools and

247
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:58,170
tips and all that

248
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:03,180
they're all using the same like circa
2007 version of high beam back when you

249
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,579
needed to install

250
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:08,290
an actual license key and somebody
cracked in this

251
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:11,519
everybody's using in the hysterical part
was

252
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,119
I got a call from a customer because my
boy security appliance was

253
00:15:16,119 --> 00:15:19,990
blocking some with their customers from
registering too their their service

254
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:23,509
you like oh my god you gotta turn the
signature of a mic but the only people

255
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:25,449
that use that as fraudsters

256
00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:29,759
like yeah but we point our customers to
go download

257
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,779
are there so clients to a where's form
in Turkey

258
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:38,139
slick it was a two it was a Turkish
telecom company in there actually

259
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:38,779
pointing their

260
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:43,920
real customers to wear site II give up
so I added an option disable that

261
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,589
signature

262
00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:50,079
the the interesting part is are .4
percent

263
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,129
basically use these tools in the sample

264
00:15:53,129 --> 00:15:57,309
Metasploit like hardly ever saw at all
but Miss ploy

265
00:15:57,309 --> 00:16:01,199
i think is probably one of the better
tools for cracking set because

266
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,569
are its it's nearly impossible to block
it with signatures

267
00:16:04,569 --> 00:16:08,540
all the fields are randomized so if
you're looking for

268
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,990
specific user agent somethings you're
not going to do it randomize is the

269
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:17,029
the numbers that are being called
basically any identifying field is

270
00:16:17,029 --> 00:16:20,079
is removed

271
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,329
so if you look at the countries are
actually hitting me

272
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:26,819
arm this this was another thing that
that shocked me

273
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:30,459
changed this year it used to be that

274
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:34,160
are you know some

275
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,569
on sorry a back up here anyways rely
tribution is hard to prove

276
00:16:38,569 --> 00:16:42,279
right because you can mask your IP
address arm

277
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:45,629
top six sources basically top six source

278
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:49,949
countries represent ninety-seven percent
the total dataset

279
00:16:49,949 --> 00:16:53,119
so there's obviously a few top countries
that are are doing

280
00:16:53,119 --> 00:16:56,449
this type of hacking alright this is the
point I was in it too soon

281
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:59,869
2013 sixty-five percent

282
00:16:59,869 --> 00:17:04,390
Voice fraud was coming from Israel the
Palestinian territories

283
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:08,560
why that is I don't know arm you know
it's it's one of those things are

284
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:13,100
different different you know natural
language forums

285
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,690
people exchange tips people people you
know meet up

286
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:20,290
their local security the get togethers
or whatever and say hey I'm

287
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:23,420
I'm doing this to make great money you
should try to

288
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:27,060
so perhaps that's that's one of the
reasons why it's happening

289
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,560
arm is also very difficult to go after
somebody

290
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,660
whose who's actually in palestine are
but the crazy part was

291
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:38,550
it fell from 2013-2014

292
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:42,600
and went from 65 down to 23 percent

293
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:49,600
there's a reason why that happened I
think

294
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:59,690
yes it so the question was how can I
told it was really coming from Palestine

295
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,419
and not just like a proxy relay

296
00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:04,669
that's it yeah

297
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:07,950
arm honestly I can't tell

298
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:11,179
but the the thing that was sorta

299
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:15,679
arm the indicator that it really was
coming from Palestine was the fact that

300
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,940
they didn't seem to take any measures to
mask your IP address

301
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,120
they're using a script kiddie tool
frankly

302
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,030
without bothering change the user agent
so was it was one of those like

303
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:30,210
you know the the data disorder pointed
to the fact that they really didn't care

304
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:34,010
and and I will tell you that my
suspicion is

305
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:37,370
even though they were servers that had i
ke registries from:

306
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:40,530
Israel they're probably coming from
Palestine anyways

307
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:43,990
you know they're they would probably
take an extra special joy cracking

308
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:47,850
server in israel and now

309
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:51,460
you know using an israeli resource scum
ironic for them

310
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,940
aren't so so the the

311
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,770
crazy partner was in 2013 US sources
wrongly

312
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:02,530
18 percent in one up to 30 5.7 percent
this year

313
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,960
anybody have any theories as to why that
might happen

314
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,340
mean

315
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:14,289
I i wouldnt I wouldn't think so cuz
because if you're going to be committing

316
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:14,570
this

317
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:19,970
type a crime why would you move to the
US where the NSA might might minor you

318
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:20,380
more

319
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:25,640
can you raise your hand I can see you I
just

320
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:32,640
okay sorry

321
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,040
yeah I would we think it might be the
other way around rate you're gonna crack

322
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,710
the US resource maybe you're gonna

323
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,830
undergo more scrutiny but up

324
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:52,150
yeah

325
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:59,150
yeah exactly

326
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:03,510
mmm

327
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,950
well also you might theory in this is
what with the the numbers are sore

328
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:07,810
telling me

329
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:11,050
arm seventy-two percent a

330
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:15,330
the US hits were from Papa writers right
so

331
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:18,530
your Amazon iraq space all that sort of
stuff

332
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:21,810
so if your gonna be cracking US

333
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:26,530
server and you're coming from Palestine
and your brute forcing so you're sending

334
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,380
lots of challenges really quickly

335
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:33,620
it might make sense to you put your
cracking resources closer to the system

336
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,710
you're trying to crack great

337
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:39,390
so I I think there there may be getting
a little bit more intelligent trying

338
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,080
office key

339
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,700
who they really are where they're coming
from and trying to build a lil bit more

340
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,780
efficiency into it

341
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:50,390
so

342
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:53,440
if if we look at this is a a volume
metric

343
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,220
are map and I give credit to my body

344
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,600
two-way who's actually a GIS researcher
are

345
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,600
who put this together for me arm so
traffic by volume

346
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,190
shows a similar story as far as the top
countries arm

347
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:12,280
you know you you got France in here

348
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,600
and in Germany arm

349
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,850
missouri was like the weird out liar
employed

350
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:24,180
miss in in it may be difficult to see
but there's some little shadowing is a

351
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,920
few other states in here in Missouri
just like off the charts

352
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,650
and the only thing I could attribute
that to you was that

353
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:35,810
arm there was this one dude who was
really really interested in cracking my

354
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:36,700
server I

355
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,470
I don't know why arm but there seem to
be

356
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:45,320
several I different cloud providers that
they happen have

357
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,370
you know servers and in the Kansas City
area

358
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:52,070
arm the it's very difficult to see

359
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:56,130
because the countries are so small it's
all it's all relative here to size

360
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:59,940
but Palestine's over here the

361
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:06,250
to the right

362
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:09,149
yep

363
00:22:09,149 --> 00:22:10,510
yet

364
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:14,330
but there there there like the Russian
carter's a the void

365
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:21,330
a fraud world I guess in that's one
talking about it

366
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:26,050
you know and it's in its it's not a

367
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:31,020
are you know it's not a a cultural or or
country slammer anything like that's not

368
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:38,020
meant to be personal it's just what the
data showing you know

369
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:52,390
I'm sorry I can chemistry point 0

370
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:55,880
right right exactly

371
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,210
your your your your your points very
well received I was

372
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:03,690
just in Israel for a couple weeks and I
was surprised at the number russians

373
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:06,940
that were actually in israel yeah

374
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:10,040
yeah there's an awful lot of them I
think you may be you know better than me

375
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,770
but I i thought perhaps it was

376
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:15,050
when iron curtain fell in russia all the
russians you said hey let's

377
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:20,550
Israel you know and I'll so

378
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:24,560
arm yeah I'm nursing my slide C me

379
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,480
chopped off just a little bit on so
let's cover really quickly

380
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,260
how to actually use vicious on which is
the

381
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,890
as I said the top say packing hacking
tool

382
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,850
aren't so Sid Vicious is actually a
number of smaller tools

383
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:43,820
if you go to backtrack it's under the
pen test weight

384
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:48,730
services directory arm so the first
always

385
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:52,550
is SB map in this is basically you're
your and map above the VoIP world so

386
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:52,900
you're

387
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,130
basically gonna give it a IP address or
IP range

388
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:59,610
and it'll just go out and are find

389
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:03,490
every device that responds back in give
you the user agent so you can't

390
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:06,860
kinda focus if I me to use a particular
are

391
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:11,210
exploit you know what what is my target
now warn you there are some systems that

392
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,180
will reply back with fictitious

393
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:17,530
use a region names in an attempt to try
of China for oil that

394
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:21,380
and there are some manufacturers that
just don't respond options at all

395
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:24,460
so what you can do is feed SB map

396
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,890
a option so what use are the options

397
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:32,190
message will use an invite method and
arm you get slightly better results with

398
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:32,600
that

399
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,570
so

400
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:40,400
once you've are found all the SIP
servers then you want to use

401
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,100
are the SB war arm

402
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,160
routine which actually does your
enumeration so

403
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,930
I found something I'm gonna try making a
call to you or register

404
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:56,670
are met I'll register to use a number
different extensions in based on the

405
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:59,700
the are response code either

406
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,320
send me your password or get an
extension doesn't exist

407
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,550
now I know exactly what extensions are
there

408
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:10,130
for me to start cracking on the
interesting part is once in a while you

409
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:12,060
get 1 I'll come back with no of

410
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:16,120
and that just means yeah I'm here you
can register to me but I'm not gonna get

411
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,720
not to challenge you for a password so
that's the Holy Grail right there

412
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,090
fam register and start making calls arm

413
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:27,090
again the invite our method may

414
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:30,330
provide you with with better our results
and

415
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:34,510
the register method oh and I will warn
you if you're trying to do

416
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:38,600
submissions scans from behind DSL or
cable modem

417
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,720
in many cases there their arm handling
for

418
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,420
the the NAT pinholes for Sep are pretty
crappy

419
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,940
quite frankly so prepare to reset your

420
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:53,740
your DSL modem or whatever multiple
times before you finish the skin

421
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:59,640
and then lastly credential cracking so
suspicious

422
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,080
SP crack defeated the extension number

423
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,270
and then either password list or you can
give it the

424
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:11,050
Ranger numbers that you want to use are
basically the the numbers and use our

425
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:12,550
reply engine to authenticate

426
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:15,780
at their handset so you'll see an awful
lot love

427
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:20,280
farm the small business systems and that
just use numerics

428
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:25,400
a lot of the like the the EMA so does
the cable vendors that also bundle

429
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,750
wat services have moved to very complex
passwords so

430
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:32,290
are in a course if you're lucky enough
to find

431
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:36,220
system out there with you know an open
web interface

432
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:39,830
or perhaps running some API's those
things are nice to see targets

433
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:43,740
lot of small businesses will have a
single admin that wants to be able to

434
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:48,560
you know him on the phone system from
home so they leave this open and of

435
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,020
course old school works too

436
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:53,970
arm if you can call voice mall our
system

437
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:57,020
and say I'm this user and then start
punching in numbers

438
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:00,240
you're probably gonna get somebody's
pincode we

439
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,470
tend to pick non-random pin codes right
everybody has a little pattern that they

440
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,370
follow

441
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:09,490
and there are actual arm sweatshops

442
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:12,860
that are set up in some countries like
the philippines and they will sit there

443
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,300
all day just

444
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,550
okay I doubt this voicemail system I got
a prophet sounded like this

445
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:21,900
oh that's a Nortel meridian system and
by default it wants

446
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,920
you know X number of digits is the code
and then I'll just sit there hammering

447
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,010
at it until they get an extension

448
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:30,410
and then they can start forwarding calls
to you you know whatever high-cost

449
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:31,790
destination

450
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:35,170
right unlike way behind here so lemme
speed this up

451
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:39,850
all right let's get to the good stuff
actually make money fast

452
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:44,350
alright so there's a few key few keys to
successful fraud that are not technical

453
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:48,760
arm timing if you're going to compromise
somebody's PBX system and then

454
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:52,520
generate traffic for fraud do it on a
weekend when they're not gonna notice

455
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,560
that

456
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,710
maybe our phones are ringing or maybe
their phone systems will slow or doing

457
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:57,320
some things

458
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,510
something weird arm get paid weekly

459
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:06,510
rate so most you most our customers are
only billed on a monthly basis

460
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:09,710
so if you can commit your fraud get paid

461
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:15,440
right away you're gonna be able to get
away with your money

462
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,840
are consider laws in contract so take
advantage of high price differences so

463
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,310
I'm gonna gonna get money arm calling to
someplace like

464
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:28,870
Africa very high-cost destination or
explain why that's important in a minute

465
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:32,110
arm you know take advantage love

466
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:35,950
the price differential call the most
expensive place you can possibly call to

467
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:36,350
get the

468
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:39,500
the highest bang for your buck right
away and

469
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,570
well a lot of people realize is there
are scenarios where

470
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:46,070
providers are or our customers are
forced to pay

471
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:50,130
so I make a call to somewhere in Africa
that African

472
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:53,480
are telco goes back to you might

473
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,460
telephone company will say AT&T inces
r-va by the way you only ninety thousand

474
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,970
dollars for calls me this weekend

475
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:03,730
AT&T because a lot of the contractual
agreements international law

476
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:08,630
is required to pay that so they have to
pay the ninety thousand dollars

477
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:11,400
and then they'll come back to you and
say you owe me ninety thousand dollars

478
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:11,980
in your like

479
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:15,790
don't have that you know are you taking
the courts a.m. I can pay that

480
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:20,440
you should have been protecting the
phone system or better

481
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,720
and of course location so cross
jurisdictional boundaries

482
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,810
arm go to countries that have very loose
or non-existent

483
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:31,850
relationships with the US law
enforcement

484
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:35,850
or whatever your country is

485
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:39,780
RA so let's do a case study how will I
actually

486
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:43,050
make money fast so Joe here is

487
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:46,310
cracks occurred angelos using services

488
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:49,850
and he wants to buy more month nor the
more nunchucks

489
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:53,100
so what would you do okay

490
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:57,820
so very first things I was gonna do is
go to one of the sites like

491
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:01,720
premium world telecom and he's gonna set
up something called a premium rate

492
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,410
service number

493
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:06,910
now the this is Sourav

494
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:09,990
on the the fringes a legality

495
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:14,140
but it's perfectly legal to set up the
phone service that you get paid for a

496
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:18,970
so if somebody calls you you you get to
charge them however many cents a minute

497
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:22,900
arm the PRS numbers basically provide

498
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,970
a number for you to dial in multiple
countries and

499
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:29,100
and based on the country that you dial
you will get

500
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:33,070
a are different share of the revenue

501
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:36,720
so for every call it comes in

502
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,170
you get five six seven cents a minute
and

503
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:43,700
their nice enough to offer an IV our
service for you

504
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:48,210
so you can host music were just a voice
announcement we're just dead air

505
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:51,480
but there's something on the other side
that's answering the call

506
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,929
so what Joe does

507
00:30:54,929 --> 00:30:58,380
as he sets up the PRS service and then
he commits

508
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:02,240
international revenue sharing fraud this
is the top broad

509
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,020
that telephony fraud managers are
concerned about today

510
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:09,070
so he basically

511
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:12,950
hides is his IP if you really cares
about not getting caught

512
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:16,550
mom uses his cracked PBX extension

513
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:20,050
and he makes his initial test called is
like %uh shown in the the set method

514
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:20,570
staying

515
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:25,450
before so he tries calling are a burner
phone or tries calling even the PRS

516
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,419
number

517
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:30,419
once just alright does it work no it
didn't try the prefixes

518
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:35,380
okay I get an outside line arm and he
can use a soft quiet

519
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:39,500
or the API or he can you something wake
the Ossipee

520
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,750
which is a tool used for testing telecom
services

521
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:47,950
it just drives set messaging so he can
use that to actually

522
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:52,970
Mila calls and in hey you know a lot of
these phone systems if you have a

523
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:57,040
a soft quiet the hub like more online
appearances so you're a lot you're

524
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,900
allowed to mail up as many calls

525
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:02,570
as you possibly can you know how many
channels you gonna PBX

526
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:06,010
so you're not limited to one call you
might know up

527
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:09,960
nine thousand calls the same destination
inside in a minute

528
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,890
arm I I was told by one customer at a

529
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:18,450
a large ima so that they saw somewhere
in the neighborhood of ninety thousand

530
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,590
dollars in one minute

531
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:23,890
from international revenue-sharing

532
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:28,169
so this is something that that can
generate money really fast

533
00:32:28,169 --> 00:32:32,580
so the PRS provider the premium revenue
sharing number provider

534
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:36,530
they will pay you on a weekly basis
there there are some that will pay you

535
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:40,630
are more frequently than that but week
tends to be

536
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:43,900
about the average and of course

537
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:48,250
given the the keys to successful fraud
that I gave you Joe will use the PBX for

538
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:49,350
one weekend

539
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:52,980
and then walk and you can generate
ninety thousand dollars

540
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:56,060
or more from that one customer basically

541
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:59,460
you know put them out of business when a
when they have to go back and pay the

542
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:04,830
phone company

543
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:09,150
so Joe decides it maybe that's a little
bit too risky for him because he's

544
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,350
generating traffic from his house

545
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:15,960
and you know maybe maybe tourism so
anonymous anymore so

546
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,300
maybe you want to get out of the game so
he decides may be the same first thing

547
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,159
do

548
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:25,159
is with other people make those phone
calls so

549
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:29,610
the PBX has you know username and
password credentials

550
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:33,010
and he's cracked those if if you're
gonna need

551
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:36,090
the gets a trucking services from a

552
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:40,360
telco some of them will actually give
you username and password

553
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:44,550
that your PBX has to register with so
you can sing your calls

554
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:48,800
them so this looks legitimate or may
look legitimate

555
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,200
arm if he says Yanira in order to send
calls

556
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,740
to are to me you need to

557
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:00,260
use username and password so what what
Joe actually does

558
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:03,560
is arm

559
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:09,399
he goes to one of these wholesale
markets that

560
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:13,679
well actually allow you to seoul our
transit services si se

561
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,580
you know are if you will send calls to
me all director calls to Africa or

562
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,379
wherever

563
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:22,790
and I'm only gonna charge you five cents
a minute words everybody else on the

564
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:25,540
market is charging you seven cents a
minute

565
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,780
so from are telecom looking to

566
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:32,280
to transit there traffic to Africa that
was a great deal right

567
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,750
so you know the they hook up with Joe's
I'll

568
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:40,320
wholesale service he peer out a buncha
traffic to Africa and all the sudden a

569
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,379
couple days later

570
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:44,820
their services stops working arm you
know

571
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,970
the they may have page 0 already and

572
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:52,359
you know the they get ripped off so

573
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:56,440
from Joe's perspective its easy it's
most the money and

574
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:02,560
none in the headache I've actually
generating Rs I RSF traffic himself

575
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,790
the the thing with these these whole
soul markets

576
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:10,350
arm is these tend to tolerate some shady
characters

577
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:13,930
on the wholesale markets are very
cutthroat and you're literally down to

578
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:15,180
fractions and sent

579
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:19,330
so somebody comes out says I can
undercut everybody by one or two cents

580
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:23,170
mean sometimes sometimes these people
are willing to turn a blind eye

581
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:27,270
and these are not you know your AT&T's
or Verizon's these are the people that

582
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:30,580
are AT&T and Verizon would hand of their
traffic to

583
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:34,080
in there only businesses taking calls
from point A to point B

584
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,540
they don't have any subscribers there
purely about

585
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:44,540
are sending VoIP calls around the world

586
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:49,400
alright so this one is is not
necessarily

587
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,170
needing a PBX this is just another way
you can make money fast

588
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:57,260
so you set up your your peer us number
in any calls coming to that number you

589
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,160
gonna get a revenue share for

590
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,990
arm when gary is actually a Japanese
term because this

591
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:06,500
this fraud scheme is actually seen in
Japan on at first

592
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,839
in basically all it means is you're
going to send somebody

593
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:13,380
arm a single are

594
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,960
a single ring call so you doubt you'd
out there

595
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,250
their number innocence hearing you hang
up so from their perspective they see a

596
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,430
Miss call

597
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:25,650
rate and there are a number I love

598
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:29,970
are exchanges in PA ranges that look
like they're in the North American

599
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,330
numbering plan

600
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:34,490
but they're actually in in the Caribbean

601
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:37,850
so you look at it was like oh this is
236 number that's

602
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:40,740
you know I don't know where that is but
let me call and find out is like a cost

603
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,109
me anything right

604
00:36:42,109 --> 00:36:45,510
wrong just cost you several books to
call it arm

605
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:48,609
you'll also see the SMS spam schemes
where

606
00:36:48,609 --> 00:36:52,740
like hey you just want something or you
know call this number if you're right

607
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,950
and not have anything that we use

608
00:36:54,950 --> 00:37:01,950
so you call the number and then you get
nailed

609
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:06,440
RA and in the last one arm T Doss

610
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:11,390
is actually the a sort of a new scheme
that's come out last couple years

611
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:14,750
telephony denial sirs everybody's heard
about DoS attacks

612
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:19,230
where you just hammer somebody with
Nelson messages are or what have you

613
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:23,780
arm T Doss is as it would imply you're
actually making phone calls

614
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:27,690
in tying up the phone system on this can
be used for fraud

615
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:31,830
it's being seen in are multi-factor

616
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:34,950
DoS attacks especially like on banks and
stuff bill

617
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:38,970
T Doss the the bank's are incoming lines
so

618
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:42,130
customers can't call them then held off
their website

619
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:46,390
and then we'll be alone slow attack will
go in and no compromise a database or or

620
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,490
what have you

621
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:52,530
but arm they can't make calls out they
can receive calls into tosses

622
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:56,960
is tying everything up the the other
vector for this though is extortion

623
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,750
there are online form similar to the
carter forms where people are

624
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,990
exchanging arm loan information

625
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:08,740
so you go to are cash your paycheck on
payday I wanted these

626
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:12,750
I you know cash RR check cashing centers

627
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:16,420
and there's a shady person there who
selling your information

628
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:21,609
that hey the the the cashed her check
they loan you some money what have you

629
00:38:21,609 --> 00:38:25,250
and arm maybe you're behind on your loan

630
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:30,070
so a extortionist will basically call
you at work

631
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:33,380
in say I'm gonna tie up your phone
system

632
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:38,310
unless you you know Pei Wei what we rode
and maybe it's fifty box maybe 75 bucks

633
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,910
here's the accounts and the money now

634
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:44,020
and they do it at work because you're
gonna be embarrassed

635
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:47,300
if the phone system gets tied up and
then when somebody finally answers ago

636
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,859
yeah Joe Smith owes us

637
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:53,480
money he's behind on his payments and oh
yeah by the way he's got a drug problem

638
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:57,280
you know if they can say anything arm

639
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,710
so unfortunately a lot of people into
paying

640
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:03,850
in in they do look at employment
information so they'll target somebody

641
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:05,280
who works at hospital

642
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,370
and lawyer's office in a doctor's office
they're looking for small businesses

643
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:12,500
they're looking for arm places where

644
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:16,680
maybe your reputation is important are
if you're going to be working there

645
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:20,130
because they know that that type of
attack will be effective

646
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:24,810
arm enough and of course you just want
to be nefarious and

647
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:28,570
and not da somebody's phone line is fun
too

648
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:32,480
so the this particular type of attack
was actually the last twenty six hundred

649
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,790
that just came out

650
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:37,580
arm has one method love are

651
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:42,480
running a at: DoS attack there there's a
couple different options here so I

652
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,339
I personally use a sippy I have a
customized

653
00:39:47,339 --> 00:39:50,609
our scripts to you do the SIP
registration

654
00:39:50,609 --> 00:39:53,910
and then send a budget calls in that's
published on my get home

655
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:58,260
aren't linked at the end now it's based
off a

656
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:03,080
register invite scenario I got from this
website this guy's got an awful lot of

657
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,750
set-piece Chris that are pretty handy
for testing

658
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:10,089
arm you can you can feed multiple

659
00:40:10,089 --> 00:40:13,950
are cracked rib credentials for
registration and then drive calls from

660
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:14,770
there

661
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:18,760
now of course the the scripts can be
modified

662
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,810
but it really depends on our what type
of fraud scheme you

663
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:25,120
your you're running here so if you want
to do and international revenue sharing

664
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,500
fraud

665
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:30,310
to generate the the most amount of money
you probably go on to you

666
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:34,130
make the initial call and then leave the
call me old up so just leave it open as

667
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:37,220
long as you possibly can burn up as many
minutes

668
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:43,410
arm for wing geary you can modify its
there soon as you receive a 180 ringing

669
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:47,510
hang up the phone right away so ban
there's your your miss call

670
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:52,230
arm wait for an answer for either either
you can wait for an answer

671
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:56,180
or you can just keep sending calls
repetitively to generate your to-dos

672
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:59,600
and then it's really up to you whether
you wanna play any audio in the answer

673
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,790
just had a dare

674
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:10,790
are eight so demo time

675
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:23,360
yeah it's not surprising see if i cant
figure

676
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:30,360
ago

677
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:33,930
alright so this is just the my back
track setup

678
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:40,200
small p.m. don't judge cuz I'm not in
Cali or anything

679
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,290
and then I I'm a person of ANOVA

680
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:46,340
astor's now just because it's a the

681
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,380
very lightweight PBX arm has a nice

682
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:53,810
web UE and arm really easy to set up

683
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:58,790
it's all so like many dreams all I'll

684
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:02,109
batteries running low here got seventeen
minutes I'm not been talking a long

685
00:42:02,109 --> 00:42:09,109
alright so basically on your dues

686
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:14,180
call sippy and direct traffic to the PBX
IP address and

687
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:17,619
and zippy intake in something called a
scenario file

688
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:22,859
and the you want to get a change my

689
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:29,859
crap

690
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:39,540
demo fail already right them

691
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:06,380
alright so I'm just gonna run this you
can you can actually see

692
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:09,959
supply its I have a

693
00:43:09,959 --> 00:43:13,849
xlite client running on my laptop and is
gonna

694
00:43:13,849 --> 00:43:20,849
your

695
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:30,220
I'll you know and helps if you store yes
client

696
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:56,650
can is not enabled account settings its
way

697
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:47,630
there we go okay

698
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:50,769
you'd

699
00:44:50,769 --> 00:44:56,219
right so I you can but you can see is on
the right side I've got away

700
00:44:56,219 --> 00:45:01,150
were different incoming call dialogue
that have popped up

701
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:07,539
in soon as I try to answer any even you

702
00:45:07,539 --> 00:45:11,519
this keeps coming and coming and I'm
like decline decline decline it just

703
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:12,299
keeps popping up

704
00:45:12,299 --> 00:45:15,489
you can see I'm generating activities

705
00:45:15,489 --> 00:45:19,509
extremely quickly you

706
00:45:19,509 --> 00:45:24,200
register anyway in the morning you
should actually needed

707
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:28,049
so no matter what I'm just like hanging
up paying am paying up and they just

708
00:45:28,049 --> 00:45:28,920
keep coming

709
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:32,190
now I will say that arm kill this

710
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:36,039
you

711
00:45:36,039 --> 00:45:39,329
really

712
00:45:39,329 --> 00:45:42,479
yeah it's its it's becoming a thing

713
00:45:42,479 --> 00:45:49,479
has been especially with financials they
love doing it the financials

714
00:45:53,099 --> 00:45:55,910
yeah

715
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:59,710
it wasn't it was in a collector it was a
is a fictitious collector

716
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:05,670
yeah

717
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:10,590
yeah

718
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:11,610
yup

719
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:14,530
you know know I will say that arm if

720
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:17,910
if your gonna duty dos I something like

721
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:21,440
a are do look out seems like the way to
go

722
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,480
breakers any way we can and set up a
Google Account your pseudo anonymous

723
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:28,820
arm the the only problem with that

724
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:32,940
is that arm pupils actually

725
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:38,940
pretty smart and if you start sending a
high call rate to them they'll just like

726
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:42,670
start putting limits on it so you can
get through maybe

727
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:45,690
two or three calls a minute then they go
yeah and I don't think so

728
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:49,380
this is automated and in you're not a
good guy so

729
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:54,050
arm really the way to go is is to go
with 10 the commercial services that

730
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:58,230
will charge you may be a couple cents
per call or just get a crack

731
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:01,560
PBX and and you know run through
somebody else's PBX

732
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:05,190
because those people are paying a
premium for commercials

733
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:12,190
trucking service and Dom they're called
are going to complete alright so

734
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:16,680
so that was option one using sippy and
then as i said on

735
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:20,010
option to which is outlined in the
latest 2600 magazine

736
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:23,440
actually has you set up are asterisk now

737
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:28,120
and the the the way asterisk NJ recalls

738
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:31,530
is through a arm are

739
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:36,940
doc call file you actually tell it what
trunk you want to generate the call on

740
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:41,060
so you you tell it you know the the SIP
channel

741
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:44,250
and you can spoof your caller ID

742
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:47,780
so you can tell it I wanna look like in
coming from here you do the same thing

743
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:49,740
the city's you edit the scenario file

744
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:53,690
and arm this is the the number I wanna
call T

745
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:59,620
so it's it's very very easy and that is
how Joe gets rich quick

746
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:02,820
arm that's my get home

747
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:06,770
so I get the scenario files as well as a
presentation up there

748
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:13,770
right any questions yeah

749
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:29,430
mmm-hmm

750
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:33,080
right so the bank can reach them or even
if they become aware of what's going on

751
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,360
they can reach the bank year

752
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:37,470
exactly yeah

753
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:41,030
yet it's that very good point that's
that's certainly

754
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:44,500
the other side over other side that Diaz
attacks

755
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:48,070
anyone else

756
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:51,520
right thank you very much
