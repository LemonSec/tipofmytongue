1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:05,580
up commuter if you really want to get
from

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,260
the most can are those who need me for
two former do things to people than are

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:09,559
you

4
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:13,849
and very strange things and you really
wanna see what's going on so you need to

5
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:16,369
move forward otherwise you missed the
bus poor

6
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:20,029
alright those of you who are religious

7
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:23,510
we have no backroom baptist in this room
today your move forward

8
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:28,310
micah moore as my for social engineering
the night by the way

9
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:33,449
make every moment so

10
00:00:33,449 --> 00:00:36,780
yeah I'm lurk arm do a lot of things and

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,940
we're gonna have some fun denied are
during this talk

12
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,889
you'll see me speeder law this large to
sum up it's just there you can go back

13
00:00:43,889 --> 00:00:44,850
to you can take it

14
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,280
do what you want to do with the learn
yourself

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,489
social engineering is a technique that
you always have to improve and

16
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:58,609
and do a lot a self-learning arm I'll
also give you some anecdotes

17
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:03,179
which contain some secrets and I'm of
things you might wanna try the social

18
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:03,869
engineer

19
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:07,109
and then we'll do it

20
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:11,390
through the early part of this large
pretty quick and get to some

21
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,710
what I call Jenna Mind Tricks things
that you can do

22
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:19,700
to improve your social engineered so
we're doing up front stuff right now

23
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,420
I'm gonna give you the first for these
really fast

24
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,859
and we have down here is this is what
you guys really here for

25
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:33,630
know those microphones really well boom

26
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,310
on the things that you will take out
your lil bit structure to your social

27
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,390
engineering wanna talk about

28
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:45,329
a social engineering equation that are
used to help convict absolutely

29
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:49,340
what you do and how you do it so that
you know you're making successful social

30
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,490
engineering attacks

31
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,850
we're gonna tour summer psychology
because it is important

32
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,960
bottom line just like you have in my
opinion Metasploit

33
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,490
psychology is the tools

34
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,090
for both reconnaissance and your
exportation the drivers standings

35
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:09,739
arm clearly to be successful you have to
understand your characters

36
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:12,879
were in a survey some social engineering
technologies

37
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,040
I have my best worst because it go out
there and you try to learn social

38
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,870
engineering

39
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,610
there's a thousand names for the things
that we're going to talk about tonight

40
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,420
I've tried the composite those into what
I call my best social engineering

41
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,790
technologies was

42
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,840
there's no way in heck we can go through
those tonight

43
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,220
so these things in fact this whole panel
presentation

44
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,340
is 8224 the class on

45
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,580
in terms of actually implementing and
using some these techniques

46
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:44,010
and I'm gonna give you five functional
goal strategy combinations

47
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:48,180
to begin think about so that you're not
just comes bring your social engineer

48
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,370
now they will get to the fun actual have
fun brother

49
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:57,959
the Keo the stalkers a lot of the social
engineering I see go on and penetration

50
00:02:57,959 --> 00:02:59,200
assessments these days

51
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,980
arm is what I call passive or arm

52
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:07,700
a different server even kinda with
implicit social engineered

53
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:12,030
you're doing a phishing attack you take
I'm emailing you send it out to

54
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,120
10,000 people or you set up a website
which

55
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,480
come to to the website social engineer

56
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,950
sometime in your career at some point in
time

57
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,230
and unfortunately for me I've had to do
this at times when it's a life or death

58
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,340
situation

59
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,420
gonna be face to face on your face to
face and you've got to change the

60
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,049
equation

61
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:34,500
that's the only way you're going to get
beyond where europe

62
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,860
and when you're doing face to face
social engineering

63
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,450
it's not something you get to sit back
for a week ago

64
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:46,879
let me write this great email and let me
send it out to ten thousand people

65
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,260
and I'll get my 1 percent under five
percent under 6 percent whatever your

66
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,980
characteristics that two stickers

67
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,709
wrong you know for the type of fishing
now this is one on one

68
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:01,219
you gotta go up ten somebody else very
quickly

69
00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:05,099
you gotta change the equation and that's
the goal today

70
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:09,400
and honestly with the five tricks that
we're going to talk about today

71
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,969
you can change the equation and you can
become very

72
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:17,410
successful social engineers you can read
the rest the stuff

73
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,430
actually zoom I wanna volunteers a
finger

74
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:25,660
butt monkey from onto my phone to her
promise I will hypnotize you were doing

75
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:32,660
coming up I move around a lot I'm very
Connecticut arm and we'll talk about

76
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:33,610
tuna

77
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,140
kinesthetic 10 visual and audio people

78
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,890
so I'll be all over the room and I'll
have to figure out where it can stand

79
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,460
relative to the speaker's

80
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:46,300
arm but good to excellent you hear me go
go go go go go

81
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:51,210
hermana so why me this has been a
lifelong passion in mind

82
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,650
you know I'm in the sixth grade I'm
writing about biofeedback because it

83
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:55,010
just

84
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:58,030
I love them on mind is very interesting

85
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,370
I'm I did spend twenty years in
intelligent Special Operations law

86
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,470
enforcement

87
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,710
those are the places I've had uses
real-world also

88
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:09,290
outsider those places I'll tell you a
story in a manner have had to do the

89
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,260
same thing

90
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,570
I'm a certified hypnotist arm

91
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:17,760
I have a ninja background don't ask me
how

92
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,990
it's a long story for one thing I want
you to take away from the slope

93
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,770
is just because I am these things

94
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:30,680
I'm not always these and one other
things the Jew

95
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,900
have to develop as your own kind of
protocol

96
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,980
as you become a successful social
engineer

97
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,310
is worn how to turn this stuff all

98
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:45,190
because at the into the day you will
kill yourself if you do this

99
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,710
24 cell you kill the relationship around

100
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,730
because we're gonna go ahead to the next
one

101
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:55,480
because the slightest true there's a lot

102
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:00,090
dirty dastardly grover powerful things

103
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:03,410
that if you get skilled in some these
errors you can do to people

104
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,160
do not believe that a hypnotist cannot
make somebody do

105
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,660
what they're not willing to do IQ

106
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:15,930
I have done it that's not too mean that
they're bad people

107
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:20,140
it's just everybody has holes in their
personality and if I can find that whole

108
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:24,190
and I can pull it off that whole you
guys prove it all the time don't you

109
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:30,520
same thing in the brain part of that
whole I can go where wanna go

110
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,010
and you don't even have to hypnotize
people to do that we'll talk about some

111
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:38,320
technologies like cold reading in
neuro-linguistic programming

112
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,290
I can do them but you never know they're
done

113
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:49,020
six days from now come back and do it
again to you never know it's done

114
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,030
time for users your own risk

115
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:56,150
I didn't get permission from Marvel
Comics for the great spider-man

116
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:01,010
comment there arm if you're practicing

117
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:04,130
do it with people you're safe were

118
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:11,130
prison a screw-up the by know how to
tell a good demo manner good terrorist

119
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:19,440
good demo man not terror still miss
movies 2 per your order to her

120
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,340
because a few crap blasting caps two
thousand times 100 or

121
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:28,550
three criminal hauling water

122
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:32,080
this is a blasting cap that when you do
a 10,000 times

123
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,280
1 I'm gonna blow up on

124
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,590
do it with people when you're practicing
that you're safe were

125
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:41,890
thats consentual that you can step back
but you can go

126
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:47,400
time now or that you can both go have a
beer laugh about it later

127
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,270
do it to your balls and it blows up on
you

128
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:55,710
welcome to the unemployment line

129
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:00,400
now a key thing I want to bring across
and in the talk tonight in the reward

130
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,960
I kinda put this together to do in with
was a lot of people in this room

131
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,740
like me are introverts it's the nature
of our business

132
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:12,280
we like to work alone we like to work
marceau

133
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:17,960
we like to do things in social settings
outside a maybe the social groups reform

134
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:24,130
they take energy away from us and that's
the true definition interests not sharin

135
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,570
it's not that you're not socially doubt

136
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:31,740
it's that as a person when you're in a
social setting

137
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:37,419
at the end to that serving you feel
drained extroverts will fall

138
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:40,599
this is what the true definition
introvert and extrovert

139
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:43,979
what I say what I've learned watching
people over the years 1 I've learned to

140
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:44,689
my own

141
00:08:44,689 --> 00:08:47,850
kinda introspection on us

142
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:52,240
is unlike the belief that a good social
engineer has to be

143
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,420
you know Pastor Bob who's very
charismatic Trenton

144
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,980
did every by saying how were you at the
same time

145
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,290
I love you weirdo

146
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:06,370
I introverts are better at this

147
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:11,230
why water introverts walk away from a
social some situation

148
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:16,220
billion during

149
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:21,430
there you go introverts are people who
are hypersensitive to the social cues

150
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,399
that are going

151
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:26,500
you walk into a room and you will feel

152
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,560
10,000 sensors going off

153
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,949
even with no one speaking

154
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:37,910
and if you're hyper sensitive that means
you can pick up on the subtle things

155
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,379
an extra for war have you ever noticed
that great sales guys

156
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:44,959
good X servers right all of marijuana
moma's to

157
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,959
to the T also or social morons

158
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:54,439
they will say you know f you with the
military hurt

159
00:09:54,439 --> 00:09:58,990
and think it's okay and everyone around
them will go

160
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:04,589
well that was okay but Marcus anything
because he's a very social person

161
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:08,329
and they're not they're not being mean a
wrong

162
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:11,879
thing is they don't have the the social
cues they're not getting them

163
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:15,050
and their bright their brain just older
you know mouth to say

164
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,449
you

165
00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:23,160
soon they're not quite as good everyone
to view the room is an introvert a close

166
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,569
to an introvert if you're in this

167
00:10:24,569 --> 00:10:28,540
profession have a gift

168
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,790
you can do good face to face social
engineered

169
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:35,959
beyond anything that you that sells
people

170
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:39,910
you just have to hold other skills and
you have to make the decision step

171
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,009
beyond

172
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:45,230
back kinda factor of this is going to
take away from me I'm not good at those

173
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,519
and just go do it

174
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:52,529
for pontoon art for we get into this

175
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:56,600
I'm a skinny scrawny not now 19-year-old
to

176
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,439
are backed in which was the dinosaur age
actually working as an orderly enough

177
00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:05,019
in a hospital we got to do a lot of
stuff stop that

178
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:08,129
people would go to jail for and

179
00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:12,319
the hospital I happen to be working in
was the county hospital that had don't

180
00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:14,129
our first four dedicated

181
00:11:14,129 --> 00:11:17,199
to all the psychiatric patients in the
county which

182
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:21,300
the majority about sensors were people
who were criminals products

183
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,910
arm very extreme

184
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:28,649
sociopaths you know a lav

185
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:31,720
very abnormal behavior now

186
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,709
I typically work the night shift so I we
oftentimes be one of the few men who

187
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:38,509
were in the building is wall

188
00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:42,100
and we got a code wrote on the first
floor which got a body down there cuz

189
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,860
probably bodies were flying at that
point on and at the end of the hall

190
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,569
where the two

191
00:11:46,569 --> 00:11:50,470
isolation rooms a rubber rooms as they
were commonly called in ICU

192
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,870
her to people outside one which is
normally my visual cue to head for that

193
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:55,959
one

194
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:59,639
and I had to order it beautifully runnin

195
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:04,350
get through the door and I'm not a foot
in on here computer

196
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:07,899
in turn around and the door shut behind
me

197
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:14,149
and there's two nurses looking in this
little poor all those big going

198
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:19,309
have which makes me want the timing go

199
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:22,529
and there's a young man about my age

200
00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:25,870
who has had a lot of behavioral problems
and

201
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:30,120
also has a pretty good criminal history
and was in isolation I had

202
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,740
worked with them before during that week
he somehow

203
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:38,009
decided to figure out how to make a
metal show up

204
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:41,999
and he's in this room and he turns and
looks at me and I turned to look at him

205
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:46,139
and the proceeds to tell me is good to
me

206
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:49,540
which was a little bit astonishing since
certain people outside the door gonna

207
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:53,019
watch me do kill

208
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:56,509
so I began to circle this person in the
room when we're kinda like

209
00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:01,499
in this little dance going round and
round and I'm trying to kind of

210
00:13:01,499 --> 00:13:06,300
you get my wits about me for second and
I realize

211
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,499
while my brain is working on this
equation his mouth was explaining how is

212
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:11,930
good dismember me

213
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:15,759
and how he's going to my skin often made
to hand out all the and

214
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:19,040
so my brain kinda comes back to reality
for many

215
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,720
and I look and I'm kinda waiting for
circuit to see if there's

216
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,769
other help that's going to come there's
no there is a small room it'll

217
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:31,499
Mumbai leventhal so we continue to do
this for quite

218
00:13:31,499 --> 00:13:36,709
I'd say 10 minutes and Palmer contigo
que no help coming I'm on my own

219
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:42,699
this guy has a weapon he's a healthy
young man in these crazy

220
00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:46,180
bone rushing is not a good choice at
this point

221
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,649
alright so I just kinda kneel down

222
00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:52,649
I noticed in the corner there was a can
of Skoal

223
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:56,360
and account looked at him I said

224
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,550
yeah you tell me before die

225
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:05,029
traveled about school on companies
online

226
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:07,990
I gotta understand i'd never dipped in
my life so I had no clue what was

227
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,499
important

228
00:14:10,499 --> 00:14:14,379
I just knew that that was some way to
get this guy off explaining how he was

229
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:17,050
going to scam you like a deer

230
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:20,139
and he takes it over to me goes you know
what you have some

231
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:25,290
the mercury I take a gold thereby show
for dinner

232
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:29,119
and I don't know what shocked me more
the media Russia tobacco to my header

233
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,720
the reality that I had about two minutes
before the tobacco

234
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,619
he'll be inside my brain away and i no
longer have all processes to work

235
00:14:38,619 --> 00:14:41,779
so I had to start working quirk United

236
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:45,720
anarchic came back over to him I said
want to join me since

237
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,410
you know you're gonna kill me anyway
while model both

238
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:53,829
3 squats down picks up the scroll pics
but do

239
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:57,360
we can look at each other for men if I
was a

240
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,980
you're good

241
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,980
underwent resulting in me tell you

242
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,140
are we going to do

243
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,130
I do but we have a problem because the
local let me either through

244
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:16,560
tool I take that night away from camping
at this point on the next thing I was

245
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,880
mouth so you're killing

246
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,400
don't happen we ought to be goes

247
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:26,070
now I think I think I'll give you know

248
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:32,280
just sounds like over to me as a war
hero WOD these people don't come and

249
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:32,960
we're gonna have to

250
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,100
such third pointedly from you I'm I'm
cool

251
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:42,910
now I can tell you a thousand times in
hospitals a team is donna dunham I so

252
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:46,860
I wouldn't normally ended up in a fight
five or six people come in and I'll

253
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,070
and reality all this guy I needed was
somebody

254
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:53,540
in Iraq from to comb his

255
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,850
to down will talk about the whole series
the techniques that are applied there

256
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:01,940
unfortunately I cannot claim to fame
that I apply viewers knowingly

257
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:06,820
that was pure instinct to survive
without point and I was way too young

258
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,990
so my social engineering equation

259
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:15,640
there are three key things that go into
a good social engineering from your

260
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:20,920
arm offensive your motivation and
understanding

261
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,500
their motivations cue the attack vectors
where you're applying

262
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:30,570
us this technologies but you're gonna
apply to other

263
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:36,180
and then that is all encapsulated inside
at the strategy slush goals which are

264
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:36,820
going out

265
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:40,660
and if you focus your social engineering
attacks

266
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:44,030
with this in mind you will be very
successful

267
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:48,260
every time and I created more work for
them

268
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:53,020
here we love them are going art

269
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:57,430
purse were removed fast so therefore
yeah

270
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:02,320
for for great psychologist the constitu-

271
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,540
everything that came out a psychology
that year okay

272
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,560
freud young moslem powerful

273
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:13,910
they the three the top three pretty much
tell you what you need to know in terms

274
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,160
reconnaissance

275
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,180
your target the bottom guy

276
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,770
is both reconnaissance but he's also
have you export that are

277
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:27,240
quickly all these things go into her

278
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,150
all these things contribute to
understanding the motivations

279
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,230
so for it basically gives you the idea
of

280
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:37,470
is this person and a

281
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:41,350
it stayed in ego stator Superior State
and how do they move

282
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:46,270
motivate operate inside each other
states he's The Who Am I of psychology

283
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:49,980
Jong gave us these or pipes K

284
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,100
and those are types have actually the
original kinda core youngin

285
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:58,060
are types have been trees modified the
best one there's 10

286
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:02,420
dozens of them today the bus one that I
use is very commonly in very easily

287
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,290
understand as the myers-briggs

288
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:08,070
I highly recommend all you go out there
and figure out what your march mergers

289
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:12,150
we'll tell you a lot about yourself
actually in and this is the what am i of

290
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,390
psychology when you're

291
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:17,420
trying to look at motivation mao's law

292
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:22,770
man's law fundamentally sows where is
this guy in terms of his needs desires

293
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:23,970
and wants

294
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:28,160
and everything else you know

295
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,380
if I'm attacking someone and they
haven't

296
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,040
eaten in a week as a real simple attack

297
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,150
a trip to McDonnell's

298
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:42,860
and 10 or 15 box and I've got whatever
information I need

299
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:46,530
for an alcoholic in there you know

300
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:52,310
their hoped on alcohol to the point the
bernardin of over your lifetime

301
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:55,330
giving him that back

302
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:59,840
I'll tell you that sounds will be crew
taking alcohol can you

303
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,340
doctors do it all the time you have an
alcoholic or

304
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,360
re: drug gotta go into hospital for
major surgery

305
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:12,230
they're gonna keep em high because you
do more harm to the person taking them

306
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,990
off the drugs were you working on

307
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:19,830
many do keeping them on the drugs quite
frankly from

308
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:23,890
seen tens of thousands of people in this
domain of addiction

309
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:28,320
you're not gonna fix their addiction
until they decide either

310
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,810
but Mazzello basically saws know what's
my physiological state where my my

311
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:34,980
safety factor

312
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,000
love so first the actualization

313
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,620
and until the lower things are Matt
people don't store operating in this

314
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,710
sphere appear

315
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:48,540
so if you go when you try to motivate
somebody who hasn't eaten with

316
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:53,550
wouldn't it be wonderful

317
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:58,560
hurdler 22 your martian

318
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,870
pavlov pavlov is the most powerful man
on the face of this earth if the new

319
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:06,940
that he could have patented birth any
should a patented birth

320
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:10,790
he would he and his heirs would be
billion trillion crooners

321
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:13,980
everything we do everything we know

322
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,950
everything we are somehow comes out a
classical conditioning

323
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:22,390
I can tell you when we get to talk about
NLP everything that all talk about with

324
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:25,800
anchoring in an LP is classical
conditioning

325
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,720
I just got a new puppy classical
conditioning do it all the time

326
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:35,340
did not really sit down didn't bowl
water he waits until I tell him to go

327
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,410
this condition we are too

328
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:41,810
we say a record-breaking PTSD

329
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:45,670
it's not a disorders classical
conditioning happens to everyone all the

330
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,060
time

331
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:50,170
you have anxiety for some reason you can
figure out

332
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:53,280
is because somewhere some

333
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,700
stimulus anchored that anxiety stay

334
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,390
for some reason they could be as simple
as a color green

335
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:04,390
you happen to be looking at a color
green

336
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:11,390
when the car hit you from the side Remo
major it make you anxious

337
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:15,210
and how people sometimes anchor these
things is weird and

338
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:19,910
and kinda different so you know I could
be looking at the same color green

339
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:26,910
but what I anchor to was the fact I saw
the Karakoram on

340
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,450
to her and have also how do I become

341
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:35,470
so person hackers terms

342
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:39,660
these guys are your in my opinion
Metasploit

343
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:43,179
freud young man's lawyer and now

344
00:21:43,179 --> 00:21:47,540
your did he go super less like picking
your operating system

345
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:52,020
you know your your juror microsoftr egos
your Linux and your

346
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:59,009
super egos a Mac alright

347
00:21:59,009 --> 00:22:01,149
mass slaughters what ports are open

348
00:22:01,149 --> 00:22:04,639
I'm kinda look like that then I remember
the poor dog Rams always Cisco report

349
00:22:04,639 --> 00:22:08,029
it's where are you what things can I
come in and talk to you about that

350
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:08,919
you're going to hear

351
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:12,559
if you're hungry you're not going to
hear something about meeting some goal

352
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,440

I STP is a mechanic mechanics like to do
things we ought to

359
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:43,350
like we good with her hands you give us
any to we'll figure it out no but I

360
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:45,230
could never figure out military

361
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:49,730
you can hand me a gone fact British SAS
ball there's only one time

362
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:53,919
we came over Phil and i'll know how many
y'all know anything about a ours they

363
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,529
are sprayed down to five basic pieces to
fill

364
00:22:56,529 --> 00:22:59,700
clean instrument Co this guy goes

365
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,750

this prick a ball claw broke down in the
500 pieces

368
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:14,370
I had laid out an armory for move the
ball into the other

369
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:17,450
okay I got social engineered on that one

370
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:24,450
my and Pablo

371
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:28,110
is a Metasploit how do you exploit these
things

372
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,860
everything you're gonna learn to exploit
social would return

373
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:36,570
is going to hinge around anchoring and
building some sort anchoring system

374
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:40,120
if I want you automatically begin to sit
in the sea

375
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,889
you know I'm gonna swallow a condition
you to move toward that see

I'm a star coming over here in standing
really close to you

377
00:23:47,789 --> 00:23:51,799

00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:52,279
other

379
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:59,279
if you don't take that clue I might be
good because I like been my music get

too bad

387
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:31,590
next time you're in a social setting at
a restaurant play

388
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:34,660
the salt pepper testing its

389
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:37,730
phone okay so

390
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:43,150
you sitting across from somebody figure
up with the imaginary midline years

391
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:48,100
between the two slowly silently without
making a big deal over

392
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,150
you know a coupon will falter pepperoni
thing

393
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:56,640
and set that shaker right up the middle
and watch what happens

394
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,679
then

395
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:04,179
few months later pick up the sole
whichever one you didn't pick up I could

396
00:25:04,179 --> 00:25:06,300
shake a lil bit said it just barely

397
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,700
across the don't go for me going at all

398
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:14,150
crazy just barely crossed Midland by the

399
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:17,770
into the meal you can't have a person
sitting

400
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:22,570
away from the table linen or mint
distance and leaving us for our way as

401
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:23,910
you open to wean

402
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:27,420
simply by moving salt pepper shakers
round the table

403
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:32,640
you can do the same thing over if you
want their tension

404
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:39,490
pulling their stuff toward play the song
purple

405
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:43,010
not some brother okay

406
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:47,230
truck tractors for simple 3 P's people
process in perspective

407
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:51,380
all the other ones that you can come up
with both are based on some prominent in

408
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,059
a blues

409
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:55,690
because people human beings the human
equation

410
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:59,280
processes were gonna get into this
organism acronyms to remember the key

411
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,620
things around the cement

412
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:06,150
laws regulations their internal
processes whatever and perspectives

413
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:10,260
or their emotional states their self
actualization States

414
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:14,800
arm the organizational and into the
states the aggregate stated the group

415
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,559
group thing

416
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:19,910
good so people attack vectors

417
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:24,110
oh more and was wrong Iran

418
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:29,150
wrong Rob we're talking about these two
things I popped out this is great

419
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,740
reforming

420
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:34,640
every insider throw up

421
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,440
forms out a one of these things

422
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:42,220
your worst anger agree for sympathy

423
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:46,190
this is what every intelligence
operatives Paul

424
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:49,350
in the field two-term somebody

425
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:53,580
as a nasa fear whether it's real

426
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:57,350
or perceived Ameda fear

427
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:01,620
an actual fear medoff years or until
filling

428
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:06,210
I feel that my dad down you know the
meta fears that we have out there

429
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:09,530
West is real simple goes it sucks to
more sucks

430
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:14,070
lost and they're somewhat slowed things
like in me which also kinda have to do

431
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:14,830
with greed

432
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:17,860
and you can I gotta understand words
coming from misery

433
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:22,550
busy physical kinda in Iraq chin greed
lust

434
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:25,790
bring them that's probably more lost to

435
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:31,000
anger anger felt anger received

436
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,120
what I mean buying received Oklahoma
anger felt easy right

437
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:41,080
I'm pissed off lovers and sorry things
you saw were people who were personal

438
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:48,080
day anger received urs

439
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:04,150
you motivated right now aren't you to
get away from me

440
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:09,180
its anger received it could be as simple
as well

441
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:13,340
and a lot of times I kids injected
people into situations when you're

442
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,580
closing at nasa

443
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:19,130
as intelligence asa lotta times are all
that energy push that anger button push

444
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,160
from a former determiner

445
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:25,420
greed is money things having to do with
money could be a car's

446
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:29,840
money you could be allies house but it's
whatever their greed is it can also be

447
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,260
there former greed or their greed stay

448
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:36,750
they've gone out the government's also
wanted to now you're bailing out other

449
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:40,920
it's a brew somebody is affiliations or
calls

450
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,660
love imprint empathy

451
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:49,200
and more moral virtues believe it or not
more mergers can be a downfall

452
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,400
people and one thing I recommend
everybody

453
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,730
if they're gonna you become good social
engineers is get beyond understanding

454
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:02,360
are to be on the condo moral world
things are off limits know the law

455
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,450
remember that

456
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:10,920
there wasn't our nation that I can tell
you right now all those people nation

457
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:15,290
we're not able people the got behind the
wheel people in Nazi Germany

458
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:18,880
were because of their moral weaves

459
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:24,880
that were transferred to them moral
virtues can get outta control

460
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,720
are next process far

461
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:35,390
flow identity rules and environment UK
when you look at a process attack you

462
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,520
want to look at the flow

463
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,880
can I change the flow can I use the flow
stubs

464
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,370
to stop what's going on because this
isn't working from a social and dinner

465
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:47,110
attack what is the chain of command in
custody that goes with the flow

466
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:51,320
okay let me talk to supervisor this is a
working okay

467
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:56,030
identity who owns the process what's the
leadership of execution

468
00:29:56,030 --> 00:30:01,310
the role the person involved relative to
the sir inside a process

469
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:04,690
do you have the power to do that no you
don't okay I need to speak somebody has

470
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:05,480
a part to do

471
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,680
so you're not going to give me that a
you know I work for the CEO

472
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:13,020
right you see how your processing

473
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:16,760
your your using identity in terms of
process attacker

474
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,460
rules and laws local jurisdictional

475
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:24,230
arm internal you know political
correctness nature's

476
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:28,980
are I'm internal complementary processes
the may dictate things that have to go

477
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,540
on

478
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:32,950
these are all important you can't stop
something you're

479
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:37,580
your transition something I do this all
the time PIII information when somebody

480
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,030
I know who doesn't need it

481
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:42,970
says wow I really need your social
security number go well I really need to

482
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:45,070
see the safe that you're going to keep
that in

483
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:50,150
and your PCI compliance Anderson this
because under federal or state law

484
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:57,150
you know start spawn things off though
why don't we needed that that's

485
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:01,160
rule all process a time in the
environment

486
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:05,200
the environment plays a huge thing here
time a day

487
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,760
you know organizational character you
guys know

488
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,990
why these Snake Eater type people

489
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:18,990
always do the missions between two and
four o'clock in the morning

490
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:29,690
people suck at doing things between two
and four o'clock in the morning I don't

491
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,380
care if you're a third shifter

492
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:34,870
so when I was with the road police
department arm

493
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:38,030
years ago in Fort Lewis stop this
because i cause brain damage

494
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:43,180
we use to actually rotate shifts every
two weeks so we went from first of two

495
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,440
seconds if two-thirds

496
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,540
my supervisor 1i called me up to go say
be over here

497
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:52,020
so-and-so tones are gone okay so you're
over there and I'm

498
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,470
I'm thinking up into my job very he owes
UK

499
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:58,980
I'm going from like you saw you drive to

500
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:03,150
five red lights in downtown Raleigh I
had no knowledge about

501
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:09,110
between two and four o'clock in the
morning we didn't have cell phones like

502
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:14,520
a solo are

503
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:19,760
good metal okay perspective attack frack

504
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,070
feelings rationalizations authority in
character

505
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:27,590
spinning a little bit extra time here
because these are the things you need to

506
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:30,120
understand when you're going to set up
your tax papers

507
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,150
feelings are motional context
persuasions

508
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:38,100
rationalization political correctness is
a great tool for social engineers

509
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:43,480
you haven't figured that out to learn it
logic is a great tool for social

510
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,590
engineers

511
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:49,890
wonderful tool the problem is we're all
logical thinkers in here

512
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:53,280
and we think we cannot logic people
would more than to doing that quite

513
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:53,880
frankly

514
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:59,480
from is going to occur real or perceived
limits with already real or perceived

515
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,190
social responsibility moral background

516
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:06,520
arm the negativity your positivity want
the things I liked on

517
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,940
Rob Floyd was it was talking about the
environment

518
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:13,980
making it positive toward people making
mistakes or

519
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:18,150
acknowledging things that they've
identified a broken K

520
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:21,580
one of the biggest beings that sucks

521
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:25,610
any environment up is where you have
this negative context

522
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:29,520
this you know okay if anything's broken

523
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:34,789
everybody is in trouble it's a good

524
00:33:34,789 --> 00:33:39,150
guaranteed to have your environment
social engineer in fact

525
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:43,880
I think it was Omar Sosa though detects

526
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,320
or was attacked purses

527
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:51,700
the founder something like that deter
yet to take versus the tour you know

528
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:55,320
you have a larger all those arguments
wrong activate

529
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,669
educate and empower that's the

530
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:03,820
only way you will defeat social and
inner activate your people

531
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:07,919
because they are thousands of them in
any environment that can help you go

532
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,950
educate them all what is right what is
wrong

533
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:14,389
and empower them to stop people and say

534
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:20,669
what are you doing I Walker Chinese
manufacturing facility

535
00:34:20,669 --> 00:34:26,290
the American manufacturer last year for
three days that's reason why I'm wearing

536
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:29,210
a suit I wore this black suit that's all
I do

537
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:35,210
have no badge own which I should have
about wrong nobody stopped me for three

538
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:35,859
days

539
00:34:35,859 --> 00:34:40,639
and the first person who did was
american and when I said

540
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:47,639
oh yeah I'm doing the security of he is
OK Go her and that's a cultural thing

541
00:34:52,849 --> 00:34:56,149
American boy in them because is
inculcated in their culture

542
00:34:56,149 --> 00:35:03,149
good so the bus

543
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:10,640
a social engineering technologies
observation and intuition now you say

544
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,820
the law many other right

545
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,089
we'll talk about a minute body language

546
00:35:17,089 --> 00:35:20,290
language in general

547
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:23,710
and this is a whole public in a bit so
hypnosis

548
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:26,880
neuro-linguistic programming con istry

549
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,910
talk about that in a minute coal-burning

550
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:33,410
from here down we're not going to get
too much and because they were truly

551
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:37,060
don't stop X will briefly go over them
and why I think they're important

552
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:40,869
Europe will actually talk to Moby Porto
some other things that we do tonight

553
00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:42,140
with the German troops

554
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,440
go so

555
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,000
observation intuition we all know that
we're supposed to do these things in our

556
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,890
store right

557
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:54,700
you need to observe observe observer you
need to know

558
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:58,359
observe the nuances but not react to
them that's the biggest thing we do

559
00:35:58,359 --> 00:35:59,020
wrong

560
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:03,480
we observe something every eight react
to it we'll talk about hun biasing in a

561
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,000
minute

562
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,980
I'm by saying is the key to doing those
and when you learn to do an unbiased

563
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,750
observation you will see things you
never thought you could

564
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:13,859
the you would never seen their arm

565
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:17,580
macro body positions my growing was all
those things you know

566
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:22,359
new build this repertoire most people
have good intuition

567
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:28,010
and introverts have great intuition as a
goal as a general group the problem is

568
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:33,450
is it is be in to us by our parents
aside in everybody else from day one

569
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:39,080
don't believe your intuition you don't
have 6 answers were you do your

570
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,910
intuition is that six sons

571
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:45,910
it is that Sixers but you have to learn
to listen to your intuition a specific

572
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:46,530
way

573
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:50,380
not in the way of okay might go to sell
me this let me go do it

574
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:54,880
its okay my guts telling me this that's
something I need to bring into my

575
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,890
environment as a tool now

576
00:36:56,890 --> 00:37:00,050
now let me understand what it's actually
telling in the context of all the

577
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,220
observations that I'm

578
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:05,869
on C here be able to control that
intuition

579
00:37:05,869 --> 00:37:09,910
most of us react out of an anxiety based
in tuition

580
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:14,640
other words got hurt something's wrong
here

581
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:19,020
than just pick something

582
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:22,940
got hurting maiming you just need to
stay right place right then

583
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,960
know more about what's going on farm

584
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,140
when your intuition when you become a
good social winner is the quiet

585
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:34,670
under doing this stuff because it will
lead you to that one nuance

586
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:38,350
that makes you realize this guy in the
room right here is the guy that i'm

587
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:39,250
gonna be able to

588
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:43,020
export

589
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,130
you like porn

590
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:51,290
goal

591
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:55,420
body language we've all heard all those
mumbo jumbo about body language a lot of

592
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,160
it is

593
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,580
there's to kinda perspectives to body
language most people we here's what I

594
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,190
call the difference a perspective

595
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:04,920
other words what is work thinking right
now by the way he's standing

596
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:09,650
K I do to but that's a small part of
what I do with body language because

597
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:14,450
just what people you're gonna pursue my
body language based on your

598
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:19,040
your structural concept in your mind
you're right-handed person you look at

599
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,280
my body language is a right-handed
person

600
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,050
if I'm a left-handed person I may be
doing the exact same body language

601
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:25,890
you're doing

602
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:28,890
but because I'm doing it from a
left-handed perspective

603
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:32,730
it looks something different to you

604
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:38,380
I mean I have eaten tonight and my body
language may be modified slightly

605
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:41,510
because I didn't be it may be cold in
here

606
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:45,770
and I may be hugging myself not because
I'm withdrawing or employing back

607
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:50,040
on creating a context that distance
Witcher talk that's normally what that

608
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,869
means is just I'm cold as hell

609
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:57,970
real simple so defensive body language
you take with a grain of salt

610
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:01,780
what you can do what you can rely on his
offense a body language

611
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:06,890
IQ I know my intent when I decide to use
their Internet

612
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:11,589
I can make it useful to me and I can
convey that into

613
00:39:11,589 --> 00:39:14,609
at least in a way that should be
partially meaningful

614
00:39:14,609 --> 00:39:20,810
mother you look good soccer

615
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:24,130
are just stand there like we're gonna
have a good conversation

616
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:27,950
okay now we're discussing her and
talking outside him feeling awkward

617
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:28,750
right now

618
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:31,840
he's gonna think this is a normal
parking position

619
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,050
we both have our hands on her hips we
could be animated or whatever

620
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:38,830
and I mean he's a pure from a group a
little bit awkward

621
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:43,350
he's got his backside everybody more
awkward for me right now

622
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:46,860
but I'm gonna change the contact
slightly

623
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:51,600
does that feel differently why

624
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,259
I move 14

625
00:39:55,260 --> 00:40:00,920
three-inches' cops do this to you guys
all the time by the way

626
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:06,860
time it's a way we take control of the
situation you're taught to do this

627
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:10,370
all I did was take my foot sink foot was
in the same

628
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:15,280
alignment because we were neutral both
squirtle

629
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,140
meant nothing as soon as I slide it
slightly forward

630
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,470
it means I'm taking control in your
brain will register

631
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:26,670
and most people in most situations now
he's prone because there's a room here

632
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:33,100
well actually kinda go like this and
you'll see that body kinda move back

633
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,350
that's often Sabah dealing with people
you know

634
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:40,440
of its a body language arm can be used
for constructive things

635
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:47,030
yes or no if you want to get picked up
by a church

636
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:50,090
are girls who were picked up by dude

637
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:54,030
you're having lunch or dinner with them

638
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:57,410
is it best to sit across from them face
to face so you can have a healthy

639
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:58,210
conversation

640
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:02,280
why position talk to him

641
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:07,350
no

642
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:12,180
its barrier some people think its
confrontational about perjury situation

643
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,230
it is

644
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:16,430
but its barrier it's a game I just
talked about a minute ago

645
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:21,030
if I put us like this we're now
associated

646
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:24,760
Thursday being tricked number one

647
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:31,160
quit sitting across from your day

648
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:38,160
it's about we talk about anchoring later
you can actually use body position as an

649
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,510
anchor

650
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:46,460
I don't have to even touch you I don't
even have to make a sound with you

651
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,579
IQ anchored to you what

652
00:41:49,579 --> 00:41:54,760
some context that I want you to repeat I
simply standing in a certain consistent

653
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,660
pattern to

654
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:59,260
and every time I'm there you return to
that state

655
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:04,270
so I'm subtly like bringing you into the
context that I want you to be in

656
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:08,700
and I start anchoring our context to
what say we're standing side by side

657
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,740
will close in a very timely manner

658
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:17,540
I love the beer

659
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,450
who returned to the state every time now

660
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:23,420
that's why you know we have the social
norms

661
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:28,030
that we develop a row and when I moved
over and bisected his body in a very

662
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:35,010
unmanly way it created in may only
contact between us right

663
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:38,420
so that's an Thank You Can anchors well

664
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:41,620
for her on

665
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:45,380
language if you think what you say has
no meaning

666
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:48,450
are you think the types the words with
you use have no meaning

667
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:53,290
are you think languages do something
that you know you as my son used to say

668
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:55,120
when he was dating is protruding

669
00:42:55,120 --> 00:43:01,880
you're wrong if you want to know the
greatest all that you can have whether

670
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,510
to phishing attack or whether such a
social and dinner

671
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:10,240
weren't to read here know what's being
said weren't to control what you say

672
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,590
now we will talk about four things we
talk about language competence

673
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:17,610
the BK d

674
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:21,770
context about dominance and predominance
and BK

675
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:25,140
the is visual Tunis Bernard auditory

676
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:28,870
an assault modality of digital which
will talk about more in a minute

677
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:33,100
tone and intonation I'm not talking with
oren

678
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:36,350
on talking like this tone changes

679
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:39,810
changes the contacts and contact the
actual content

680
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:46,330
what did they say good social mood
engineers warned to say what they need

681
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:47,030
to say

682
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:51,620
without saying it the content is

683
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:54,630
abstract on

684
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:58,570
the reason why language is so important
is it not only tells us

685
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:02,150
who were doing well but gives us the
pattern

686
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:09,150
to change what we want who also
volunteer awards would be nice to stomp

687
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:11,710
on a beer

688
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:16,190
around they seldom

689
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:20,610
the mark from you to tell me

690
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:23,880
just tell me

691
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:29,150
a fun thing that you did this past
summer I read a couple books

692
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:36,150
dollar but see

693
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:38,680
i win to Beach

694
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:44,919
with some my family my friends

695
00:44:44,919 --> 00:44:45,829
sauce movies on

696
00:44:45,829 --> 00:44:48,999
not their

697
00:44:48,999 --> 00:44:52,390
nothin credible in action

698
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:55,869
in the language he used

699
00:44:55,869 --> 00:44:59,130
friends about them

700
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:02,660
many times do you hear somebody when
they're talking to you may say

701
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:07,309
I feel like did you see that

702
00:45:07,309 --> 00:45:10,579
now

703
00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:14,359
we think bit they're saying see because
they're trying to convey

704
00:45:14,359 --> 00:45:17,660
a visual they're actually conveying

705
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:22,910
how they interpret the world is visual
now I can tell you

706
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:27,959
that he is probably a canister called a
Tory person those are his dominant

707
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:30,339
systems he probably likes a lot of music
don't you

708
00:45:30,339 --> 00:45:35,369
you probably interact with the world
with your hands

709
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:41,209
a fair amount how did I know that I hear
anything goes wrong when he said he

710
00:45:41,209 --> 00:45:42,630
talked about going to a movie

711
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:47,809
the most visual thing you can go do

712
00:45:47,809 --> 00:45:52,079
welter

713
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:56,619
learn those you get free beer all night
long he's a walk in the bars in us

714
00:45:56,619 --> 00:46:02,559
until the bar maid bartender I'd say if
I can talk to you in in the next five

715
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:05,009
minutes to you 10 things that I don't
know

716
00:46:05,009 --> 00:46:09,519
that a a stranger should never know
about your get a free beer I had one

717
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:13,640
drop the beer market and start beating
the crap out of their co partners

718
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:18,579
because they thought they had told me
all the style it was by simply listening

719
00:46:18,579 --> 00:46:20,319
to the words that they use

720
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:25,929
as I talk to them time

721
00:46:25,929 --> 00:46:29,019
to her alright

722
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:32,640
hypnosis and NLP Hypnosis is the heavy
former nopee

723
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:37,380
they're kinda compatible systems I'm
hypnosis is based on all the stuff with

724
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:38,339
hypnosis does

725
00:46:38,339 --> 00:46:42,249
balls down the for kind of things giving
the person's focus

726
00:46:42,249 --> 00:46:46,119
we're very disparate the defocus people
was a

727
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:50,479
an interview normally so understand that
when your social engineering you need to

728
00:46:50,479 --> 00:46:51,159
have focus

729
00:46:51,159 --> 00:46:54,459
I have a trick with my dog but I do that
you know when he's not paying attention

730
00:46:54,459 --> 00:46:56,349
to put the tree that my headed to watch
me

731
00:46:56,349 --> 00:47:00,819
you know doesn't mean that you go up to
the

732
00:47:00,819 --> 00:47:07,780
motel operators checking UN ago watch me

733
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:10,860
they're probably gonna send the big guy
who stands at the door

734
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:14,180
looks likely to beat the crap outta you
over there to take you an escort you

735
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:14,860
know the place

736
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:19,590
arm rhythm relaxation

737
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:25,380
a metaphor visualization now want to
talk about the matter for visualization

738
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:28,850
per minute even if you're the greatest
that matters in the room you can screw

739
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:29,380
it all

740
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:35,210
even if you can get people in the ha
your drawing out the southern mouth

741
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:36,430
hypnotic state

742
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:39,520
you can screw it up if you go in there
and when you're

743
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,780
you know your trying to hypnotize them

744
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:47,480
you go okay what I want you to do now is
parked like a dog with early are judging

745
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:51,340
not for work

746
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:55,190
you have to use visualization

747
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:58,330
or their system visualization tools spew

748
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:01,340
a very big one the most people a
metaphor

749
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:06,670
so in fact when I'm checking on that
line to the hotel and there's 44 people

750
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:07,460
from me

751
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:10,660
and their bunch about Hurd's you know in
their light cream

752
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:14,700
a lot of havoc for her are him I'm not
being successor

753
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:18,850
you know I'm a step up to the thing
because I want this week room upstairs

754
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:22,550
for them base room price today ago

755
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:26,860
as people or more you wanna Jesus before
you

756
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:31,300
deal with me I want to do liked it
restructuring lie I couldn't I mean

757
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:33,080
that's horrible stretching muster

758
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:36,240
which is without a keyboard for Mina
right now and just

759
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,780
can take a sucka Rikku is looking to
keep order

760
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:44,230
just take a look at the borders to
perform the goodie bro

761
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:48,210
just relax I want you to be relaxed when
you turn me on because I don't want to

762
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:49,670
be like these people behind you

763
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:53,240
would you take a deep breath I want you
to relax and I want you to relax and I

764
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:53,850
want you to

765
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:58,260
just work all the stuff cuz nobody
should be treated that way

766
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:02,910
and you know what

767
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:07,370
if I were you in your checking in at
hotel right now

768
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:11,530
I would imagine that I wanted the same
like state that you're in right now

769
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:16,160
and I we want to treat everybody in that
line as best as I possibly could

770
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,400
I Magin that those people while I'm
probably won't

771
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,520
the wonderful most wonderful environment
that their you

772
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:26,060
but you can provide them a great service
and when you do that it's going to make

773
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:26,890
you feel better

774
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:31,770
and its gonna make them happiness can
make them smaller to

775
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:38,770
nowhere in there to say give me the room
upstairs with a suede

776
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:43,900
did I

777
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:49,950
so when you start doing this and no no
no water here be having a system I

778
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:54,490
but when you start doing some things
with neuro linguistic programming

779
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:57,710
you get to those states and the thing
that you want to avoid it as being the

780
00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:00,820
don't go trying to

781
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:06,350
home know the sort that will reject

782
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:10,080
even in a hypnotic state
neuro-linguistic programming

783
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:15,170
the big psychological context behind
this basically consist a reporter

784
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:18,290
some hypnotic concepts that are

785
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:22,420
better in there and it's all waiting
hypnosis on classical conditioning in

786
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:24,960
state line with state language is just
you

787
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,320
understanding the person state moving
them between States

788
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:32,190
arm in it this is this is magic does

789
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:35,860
there's a i mean if we had time tonight
we just don't

790
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:40,500
there's a arm Creek lobby affects

791
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:44,980
someone who's whose spirits note in
there whiskers fighters on

792
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:48,810
I would really can walk you through a
process and to minister was

793
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:51,690
and put a Snickers bar turn your hand
when you leave this room and you just

794
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:53,070
walk out with lawyer was a per

795
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:59,200
it's that easy

796
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:04,090
as the magical stuff go okay

797
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:08,290
canister in cold reading these are some
kinda meh to topics I like

798
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:11,850
reading about congress tree because
these guys have a science

799
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:15,740
behind what we do a social engineers
they have a language

800
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:18,750
a programming language that describes
that science

801
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:23,140
and they also have kind in the meta
project points and in fact

802
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:28,160
their whole language is built around a
different things the different attacks

803
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,030
that they do

804
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:32,730
and each one has its kinda homo plan
around a bit here some other language in

805
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:33,880
her summer plans

806
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,940
and they all no

807
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:41,020
that in the is and you have to deal with
what you've done

808
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:44,380
that's the key thing that congress treat
each is that social engineers don't do

809
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:45,030
all the time

810
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:49,960
every great con world do these poor last
through think

811
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:54,020
love last three things there which is
taking off the touch blowing him off and

812
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:55,190
putting in the effort

813
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:59,300
putting in the fix is the step that they
do that make sure that that guy that

814
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:02,080
they just rip off for fifteen thousand
dollars

815
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:08,220
doesn't come hunt them down and kill
them

816
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:11,610
and when you become good social
engineers even when you're doing this in

817
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:13,420
a penthouse

818
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:16,890
in your social engineering the CEO or
see your company

819
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:23,790
you don't want him to hunt you down and
kill you

820
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:28,120
cold reading is another one arm it's
basically all the things you hear about

821
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:31,200
your palm reading and tarot cards and
all that sort of stuff

822
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,680
hokey pokey bokra but it's actually
science

823
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:37,740
it's actually a science a pattern
talking to someone

824
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:42,870
but you can covertly elicit amazing
amount of information

825
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:47,130
develop tremendous amount to report and
also

826
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:51,420
begin to have this person functioning as
your agent

827
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:56,320
its kinda I'll I use the language stuff
that I was talking memory or call

828
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,820
reading together

829
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:04,240
combine that I get free beer to grow

830
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:08,120
and now the final thing here is
understand there's five goals that you

831
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,240
can achieve with

832
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:13,280
with the social engineered and their
five strategies that you need to build

833
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,630
around those

834
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:18,010
your five-goal states can be people
actions defense

835
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:23,090
information in truth there really is
nothing else

836
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:27,260
today in each one of those has their own
strategy

837
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:30,900
he would take some you know

838
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:34,900
home I talking about the strategies
because when you're talking about people

839
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:37,280
were you trying to identify them as an
asset

840
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,200
are you trying to leverage them one time
were you trying to turn members nasa

841
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,420
there's lotsa strategies a job implement
around

842
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:49,000
actions how do you go in and a very
precision surgical manner

843
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,710
get this action dont get out difference
tribes do involve

844
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:58,780
the fence you know your social
engineering attacks has blown up

845
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:02,840
and the third Mongolian border there
police are coming over the hill

846
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:09,050
how do you stop that from happening

847
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:16,000
are right now we're jumping to the jet
I'm on tricks

848
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,070
before the first to the basics

849
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:24,780
in the first basic that you need to
learn a social engineers on biasing

850
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:27,850
on by singers at Gestalt technique that

851
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:31,540
is very powerful arm and even
interpersonal relationships this is

852
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:33,390
going to help you tremendously

853
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:38,040
so how many times when you're in the in
a conversation the run into a situation

854
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:41,580
were you begin to fill yourself
emotionally start

855
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:46,150
increasing or decreasing because the
dialogue what's going on

856
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:52,120
very will yeah me too

857
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:55,610
if if you've ever been in combat

858
00:54:55,610 --> 00:55:00,330
and you actually have to shoot somebody
real balls that in there shooting back

859
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:04,080
there's a same context that goes along
is the context

860
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:09,100
of tunnel vision and what goes on with
most conversations

861
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:13,080
is tunnel vision you start becoming
mostly engaged

862
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:16,270
you're not seeing the periphery you're
seeing that emotional engagement it's

863
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:18,880
either increasing or decreasing as a
result for that

864
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,110
unbiased and gives you a technique to
stand off to the side

865
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:25,230
and see everything that's going on both
what you're saying which is

866
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:28,750
oftentimes very stupid and what they're
saying

867
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:32,640
which may be clues as to what you should
be saying

868
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:36,310
but you're not hearing when you're in an
emotional context

869
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:41,230
the way you begin to prepare yourself to
do this in context that or

870
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:44,310
tents rich is

871
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:47,600
every time you're interacting day in day
out here at the water cooler talk to

872
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,520
somebody

873
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:51,510
begin to think in the back your mind so
you create this little man that's

874
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:54,550
standing off to the side watching you
talk

875
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:58,600
play that little Monday after Wall won't
be our official you're actually be

876
00:55:58,600 --> 00:55:59,609
sitting there

877
00:55:59,609 --> 00:56:04,580
having conversations with people going
what does that will man saying

878
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:09,310
is amazing its like two conversations
going on in her head at the same time

879
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:12,359
why do you want to do that

880
00:56:12,359 --> 00:56:15,570
now you're observing when you do

881
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:20,140
you're not observing film you're
observing the entire contact

882
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:24,480
you're observing the fact that you
didn't hear that they were visual person

883
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:30,080
and you're talking in an auditory
language over here

884
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:33,780
now just as I before you too much
further with us

885
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:37,220
one thing and I'll

886
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:40,080
everybody who's got a healthy or
unhealthy relationship for to make a

887
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:40,950
healthy tonight

888
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:45,120
healthier okay understand that we

889
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:49,780
as introverts hackers computer people
logical people

890
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:52,910
we do this monstrously

891
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:56,400
when someone says to you I

892
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,680
feel bad about the and

893
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,770
you know that you just didn't do what I
want to do

894
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:09,390
okay it does mom matter

895
00:57:09,390 --> 00:57:14,310
what logic you apply

896
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:17,790
in till you acknowledge an excerpt

897
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:21,690
their perception of the world and that's
what up

898
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:26,220
on biasing allows you to do is to begin
to see the whole perceptual context that

899
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:27,420
you need to look at

900
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:31,570
it to be a good social engineer you have
to do that to start today in every

901
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:33,240
conversation lunberg

902
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:38,870
haven't third man off to the side
looking at what's going on here

903
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:41,920
now I was just talking with him and
having him talking I was having to do

904
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:42,880
the smart thing

905
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,170
but how did I hear the things that you
dozed in here

906
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:49,890
reliable bird man standing over there
listening for me

907
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:54,450
okay that's and biasing it's a great
technique weathers social engineer just

908
00:57:54,450 --> 00:57:58,030
having a better relationship with people
more on

909
00:57:58,030 --> 00:58:02,530
the context the person's thought
processes

910
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:06,180
or they visual are they saying words
like see

911
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:09,770
paid

912
00:58:09,770 --> 00:58:13,280
can you you put if you listen to those
words

913
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,500
are you seeing a picture as a result
power

914
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:19,720
that's a visual person if I'm

915
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:23,820
a visual person by the way I think
that's roughly 60 percent

916
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:26,840
people have a predominant visual system

917
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:30,710
just as a side so you can place that's
if you want to sometimes

918
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:34,650
arm if I'm a visual person and you start
talking to me

919
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:38,470
about he re the sound of

920
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:41,850
sounds why

921
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:45,720
I will hear the words are in your mouth

922
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:49,700
but it would be nicer for you to speak
them in Russian to me

923
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:56,700
because I'm not paying attention to them

924
00:58:57,010 --> 00:59:00,020
as a further saw it

925
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:05,000
big bowl a lot of people in the world
are visual feeling or auditory feeling

926
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,960
and their one or the other principal
dominant structures

927
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,790
you rarely get somebody who's just one
you hear the word

928
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:15,870
I feel like it weighs heavily on me

929
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:20,520
that was dragging out what's that

930
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:23,590
to feeling person

931
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:26,630
now what's this digital creature

932
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:32,520
they want to buy stand-up report when I
write a look at the room

933
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:35,720
and everybody in a pass the digital
Richard Illingworth

934
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:39,710
Baulkham you in her house some sorta did
your contacts go ahead sat down

935
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:42,940
digital contacts as a person who is
using

936
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:46,390
what I call neutral words

937
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:49,490
or may use a chaotic usage up the other

938
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:54,280
I'll systems BK and a other words big
switch the red contacts are seeing

939
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:57,660
something to hearing something to
feeling at all in one sentence or

940
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:01,750
you know right next to each other that's
a digital person they're speaking very

941
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:03,060
precisely

942
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:08,540
digital people or people who tend to be
extremely highly logical

943
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:13,600
the arm they may or may not have a
predominant system because of some sort

944
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:14,350
of

945
01:00:14,350 --> 01:00:17,400
arm event that took place in their life
or

946
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:20,620
they dear all very arm

947
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:26,070
abstractly with the world around them a
lot of surgeons for instance because

948
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:30,190
they have to deal with you know bodies
that are bleeding blood and

949
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:35,250
gunshot wound things like that maybe
digital people

950
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:39,350
digital people or a loss they are kind
of a sudden modality the people slipping

951
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:42,530
from time to time

952
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:46,020
are another thing that you need to do
with language because

953
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:51,130
personal nurse go from you want or I
won't work and you

954
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:58,000
the metaphor metaphor would be and study
you would wonder will you you will

955
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,859
you will have a bigger room if you
travel fifteen hours with you

956
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:06,960
I said that to you be four more warning
to give me a room then if I said want to

957
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,270
give me the room

958
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:14,600
notice have it shipped the contacts
between how I approach somebody

959
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:19,420
in both games beer now and it gives them
a now

960
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:24,300
it's not taking a hammer and beating
somebody with your questions

961
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:27,450
here's a big one people your biggest

962
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:32,540

965
01:01:40,390 --> 01:01:43,920
own stock the vehicle that I had stuck
in this big mud hole

966
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:50,920
as a result of asking for the time but I
password today

967
01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:55,750
another big 10 the basics learned to use

968
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:58,980
silence

969
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:02,109
learn to use I'll silence

970
01:02:02,109 --> 01:02:05,920
love you want to get this cuz you're not

971
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:10,580
of communication it slices it dices cuts

972
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:14,010
K if you go to say something negative
don't

973
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:17,570
to silence

974
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:22,410
it's far more profound that saying your
big area

975
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:27,609
he say something profound immunize go

976

you're not sure if your big area but you
feel like a big area

977
01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:38,670
right arm it also causes uncertainty
uncertainty

978
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:42,250
is an emotional hypnotic context

979
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:47,210
but you can leverage did you hear that
emotional hypnotic

980
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:51,140
when you're on certain you're
susceptible

981

beginning of this

993
01:03:46,290 --> 01:03:50,790
okay bats a real small why is that a
real small

994

995
01:03:55,359 --> 01:03:56,770
of the muscles around here

996
01:03:56,770 --> 01:04:00,050
dish on was a psychologist who

997
01:04:00,050 --> 01:04:03,500
you know back in the day when we could
do these fun things

998
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:06,570
hope people's faces up to electricity

999
01:04:06,570 --> 01:04:11,150
to try to repair it reproduces real
smiles

1000
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:16,319
show these pictures to people one-third
which is a real smile

1001
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:20,750
and he discovered the characteristics of
what made a will smile

1002
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:24,450
UK and believe it or not as a deep

1003
01:04:24,450 --> 01:04:29,120
d unconscious level we respond to any
real small

1004
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:33,470
it is disarming is a 1-over elements of
truth protection

1005
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:38,810
edit opens the door to report

1006
01:04:38,810 --> 01:04:43,230
now this girl to a helluva job trying to
create a real small over here bitch

1007
01:04:43,230 --> 01:04:47,640
country so you wanna ask me will then
how do we do that is good social

1008
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:48,780
engineers because

1009
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:51,790
a you need to be able to detect when
somebody switching to push the button up

1010
01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:54,290
underneath the table would have you put
on the floor

1011
01:04:54,290 --> 01:05:01,290
because they're going yes I'll do that
for you

1012
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:05,080
but a quick story or

1013
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:09,650
when they're actually going to do what I
so

1014
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:13,490
arm and they're engaged with me right we
needed to talk to

1015
01:05:13,490 --> 01:05:16,690
we also need to know how to use that
smile

1016
01:05:16,690 --> 01:05:22,290
so how do you get a good chance Molly by
gonna do

1017
01:05:22,290 --> 01:05:29,290
no you don't put edging pattern your
underwear

1018
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:35,339
good you guys working here anchor anchor
one

1019
01:05:35,339 --> 01:05:38,960
find something find a context

1020
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:42,480
that can make you feel inside that

1021
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,700
you know dish on small an

1022
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:49,770
find a way anchor that context into a
mental cue

1023
01:05:49,770 --> 01:05:53,190
there when you need to bring it on you
can bring it on mines The Beverly

1024
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:57,250
Hillbillies I don't know why but that
them show

1025
01:05:57,250 --> 01:06:01,990
makes me a just war to smile always said
if I ever have cancer and discuss it

1026
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:05,180
then play The Beverly Hillbillies over
and over again tortures a

1027
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:08,870
appear will okay going to the gym

1028
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:12,130
arm miss so those are the basics

1029
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:15,140
those are things that you need to refine
every day

1030
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:18,450
you need to practice them and yes the
chance mile thing you have to look in a

1031
01:06:18,450 --> 01:06:19,710
mirror go

1032
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:23,569
well that was ugly 10,000 times into you
get it down okay

1033
01:06:23,569 --> 01:06:27,339
anger that contact now we're talking
about report you read all sorts of

1034
01:06:27,339 --> 01:06:28,640
things all report

1035
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:31,880
you really thinkin and sell style of
neuro-linguistic programming

1036
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:35,240
talks about reports that the fundamental
and honestly

1037
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:38,770
whether you're on the phone face to face
whatever it is

1038
01:06:38,770 --> 01:06:42,060
if you're gonna get them to do anything
for you

1039
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:47,000
you're better use report you better
establish report

1040
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,190
now there's some really crazy stupid
things that they'll tell you about

1041
01:06:50,190 --> 01:06:51,400
report

1042
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:56,410
like match their breeding follow their
body position

1043
01:06:56,410 --> 01:07:00,109
UK I was interviewing a guy one day and

1044
01:07:00,109 --> 01:07:04,280
like 10 minutes into this interview
every time I did this he did this every

1045
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:06,710
time I did this he did this you know

1046
01:07:06,710 --> 01:07:10,600
and I i finally stopped the gonna go
work I'm really well trained here

1047
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,680
you're looking like an idiot

1048
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:18,060
you're not building report with me

1049
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:21,550
and I don't know about you are used to
have a neighbor in my subdivision

1050
01:07:21,550 --> 01:07:25,790
I wouldn't this go I could told so

1051
01:07:25,790 --> 01:07:28,609
who school

1052
01:07:28,609 --> 01:07:30,830
and I literally

1053
01:07:30,830 --> 01:07:33,660
me finish moves though

1054
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:35,430
is

1055
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:36,299
mmm

1056
01:07:36,299 --> 01:07:41,589
tunes throws and I think it took five
boroughs

1057
01:07:41,589 --> 01:07:45,990
an hour by the way he talked

1058
01:07:45,990 --> 01:07:50,530
I could not match is bringing if I
wanted to

1059
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:53,730
try it would kill me

1060
01:07:53,730 --> 01:07:57,420
now what does that mean matter breathing

1061
01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:02,559
the way a person breathes kinda dictates
the speed they speak

1062
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:06,589
and it kinda gives you a clue to those
been the anesthetic

1063
01:08:06,589 --> 01:08:10,000
visual kinesthetic auditory modes okay

1064
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,890
feeling people can Hispanic people need
really really slow when they'll call

1065
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:15,990
release world

1066
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:19,720
cool and just because we're southerners
and we kinda

1067
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:23,069
talk slow I doesn't mean world canister

1068
01:08:23,069 --> 01:08:27,470
a medium kinda pace to breeding your
speech

1069
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:32,279
tunes to be in auditory mode and a very
fast pace we're suppose really

1070
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:37,049
that's a visual mode okay just as a

1071
01:08:37,049 --> 01:08:41,299
as a background but in the sense a
report if they're breathing fast

1072
01:08:41,299 --> 01:08:44,569
you should kinda begin to pattern your
breathing

1073
01:08:44,569 --> 01:08:48,370
but don't try to take it to the same
level if that doesn't work for you

1074
01:08:48,370 --> 01:08:49,759
because you will look like

1075
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:53,220
somebody who's decided to put twenty
cigarettes in your mouth

1076
01:08:53,220 --> 01:09:00,040
in re at the same time if you're not a
fast breeder in their breathing fast

1077
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:05,370
try to shift in their direction but
shift the way that you can shift

1078
01:09:05,370 --> 01:09:09,549
normally without looking like an idiot
UK

1079
01:09:09,549 --> 01:09:14,200
don't overdo it let some of these other
things like body position

1080
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:17,830
in language take you there for our way

1081
01:09:17,830 --> 01:09:21,730
so body position yes reasonably we need
to match body position

1082
01:09:21,730 --> 01:09:25,520
but if the person scratches their hand
puts a leg up you should go

1083
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:29,970
okay and it's also a mirroring so it's
not

1084
01:09:29,970 --> 01:09:34,060
but your logo so if he puts his leg up
like that it's not like those

1085
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:37,759
that's not merengue thats its

1086
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:42,100
like this were compatible

1087
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:46,480
but every time the trees position

1088
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:51,170
you look like you know a monkey on crack
if you're trying to follow them

1089
01:09:51,170 --> 01:09:56,320
change the macro position so they leave
four leaf or that they lean back lean

1090
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,020
back

1091
01:09:57,020 --> 01:10:01,460
if they close the body of clothes the
body of don't try to read it necessarily

1092
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:07,430
if they open their body up open your
body up occasionally throw in something

1093
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:08,130
they're doing

1094
01:10:08,130 --> 01:10:12,610
so failing for a lurch and maybe that's
an appropriate thing to import on your

1095
01:10:12,610 --> 01:10:13,120
chin

1096
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:16,830
slowly the two

1097
01:10:16,830 --> 01:10:21,010
you you'll actually fine when you start
doing these things you'll actually start

1098
01:10:21,010 --> 01:10:21,760
feeling

1099
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:25,300
this the report back you'll be gone I
like this guy

1100
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:28,870
who this is cool as you do this

1101
01:10:28,870 --> 01:10:32,030
but if you try to do it like I said a
monkey on crack

1102
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:36,920
you won't you'll just be like speed
reading through this thing

1103
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:40,210
turn

1104
01:10:40,210 --> 01:10:43,840
and then language

1105
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:48,430
store matching their language if they're
using a visual mode

1106
01:10:48,430 --> 01:10:52,310
user bodes but add some visual to it

1107
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:55,450
you know I really feel like

1108
01:10:55,450 --> 01:10:58,810
that will work for us

1109
01:10:58,810 --> 01:11:03,110
but I can't see what you're saying about
the changes that we might make

1110
01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:06,960
so I'm a chemist other person but i just
want to a visual mold

1111
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:13,960
I did see match the context to the words
with so

1112
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:19,050
in the the bikini with this report
building is

1113
01:11:19,050 --> 01:11:23,060
pace and transition and integrate

1114
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:26,670
if you're not feeling the pace happen
naturally

1115
01:11:26,670 --> 01:11:29,990
you're not going to transition to that
mode that I just told you we're both

1116
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:30,760
feeling it

1117
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:34,930
your ultimately not an integrated
alright

1118
01:11:34,930 --> 01:11:38,430
normally at this point I might have you
guys try this but we're running behind a

1119
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:39,130
night so

1120
01:11:39,130 --> 01:11:42,500
what's going on tonight I reading

1121
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:47,080
this is your light detector this tells
you everything you need to know about a

1122
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:47,650
person

1123
01:11:47,650 --> 01:11:51,330
I tell you right now but I can beat
every polygraph

1124
01:11:51,330 --> 01:11:54,730
ever by telling you weather person is
true or false

1125
01:11:54,730 --> 01:11:59,900
if I have five minutes to talk to me and
then watch the responses is based on

1126
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:00,470
their eyes

1127
01:12:00,470 --> 01:12:03,570
does eyes don't why

1128
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:07,860
are my boss is in the room tonight when
he came and I actually did award

1129
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:09,050
technique on them

1130
01:12:09,050 --> 01:12:12,150
he didn't know if he's gonna go home but
not now Justin arm

1131
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:16,860
know he walked right by me and I
actually use the fact that I didn't look

1132
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:20,700
even though I stand out as well then we
go in the room with the suit on

1133
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:24,530
for him not to see me and that's a great
thing

1134
01:12:24,530 --> 01:12:27,530
our eyes convey power people when

1135
01:12:27,530 --> 01:12:30,530
I used to have to do a reconnaissance
and one time I had to sneak

1136
01:12:30,530 --> 01:12:35,170
literally up arm the guard was like here
and I'm laying on the ground with his

1137
01:12:35,170 --> 01:12:38,210
ash is going down the back to my shirt
as he was smoking

1138
01:12:38,210 --> 01:12:45,210
and lay there for a day and a half now
the reason why

1139
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:49,550
was able to do that outsider having a
lot a good camera phone

1140
01:12:49,550 --> 01:12:56,550
I never looked at him eyes tell you and
do

1141
01:12:56,850 --> 01:13:00,490
you so much power in terms of a person

1142
01:13:00,490 --> 01:13:04,390
if you cannot make good eye contact in
this room you can regard to use

1143
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:09,830
and you mort be a good communicator
Soward overcome

1144
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:13,730
I told my son he was with my older son
who will be awkward dating

1145
01:13:13,730 --> 01:13:18,340
and no I told him work I want to go to
school in them

1146
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:21,890
by most beautiful woman in the schools
you want I'm in the Hall

1147
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:25,600
I want you to hold I contact for five
seconds

1148
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:28,930
that a promise you by the end of the by
the into the day you'll have one other

1149
01:13:28,930 --> 01:13:30,800
phone numbers

1150
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:33,850
he wouldn't do it he wouldn't do it with

1151
01:13:33,850 --> 01:13:39,900
when the two weeks later he goes

1152
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:43,469
that works

1153
01:13:43,469 --> 01:13:46,590
it does now for Twitter was good liar

1154
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:51,080
nasa accessing cues these are real
warned this map

1155
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:55,949
this is also for right-handed person on
when you get the slides it has a

1156
01:13:55,949 --> 01:13:59,960
a good thing that you to go look at this
interactive basically

1157
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:03,600
when people were in a visual frame-up
martine

1158
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:07,270
their eyes are going to be looking up
and whether

1159
01:14:07,270 --> 01:14:10,670
they're constructing something which
means the building it the picture in

1160
01:14:10,670 --> 01:14:11,480
their mind

1161
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:14,840
or whether they're remembering which is
there going into that memory grabbing

1162
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:15,300
your

1163
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:18,969
depends on which way to go arm

1164
01:14:18,969 --> 01:14:23,110
auditory typically girls a midline

1165
01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:28,120
movement of the eyes and then
kinesthetic unfeeling or down

1166
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:35,120
so how do you use this well first off to
use it by just understanding those

1167
01:14:35,469 --> 01:14:38,630
BK the concerts

1168
01:14:38,630 --> 01:14:42,850
okay there visualizing in in their head
right now okay there

1169
01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:47,760
visualizing visual I okay this is a
visual person right

1170
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:51,400
other thing years

1171
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:54,650
this is where lie detection happened if
you have somebody by if we have enough

1172
01:14:54,650 --> 01:14:56,510
time had to have someone come up in a go

1173
01:14:56,510 --> 01:15:01,239
okay on my watch Nurse I want you told
me a story that's true

1174
01:15:01,239 --> 01:15:06,480
make you watch their eyes letter I want
to tell me a story

1175
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:09,870
that's falls their

1176
01:15:09,870 --> 01:15:14,370
our eyes can not match what they did
when they did truth

1177
01:15:14,370 --> 01:15:20,480
more than likely when they tell you the
truth thing

1178
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:24,930
they'll be hearing what's going on there
be feeling what it made them feel why

1179
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:29,100
they may have to occasionally look a
picture

1180
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:33,600
normally when they lie they've got a
construct the hell out other thing

1181
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:37,530
so they're up there in visual
constructive going okay whatever you say

1182
01:15:37,530 --> 01:15:38,790
no it's okay what is

1183
01:15:38,790 --> 01:15:45,110
hamburger described a it's like a stop
light blinking in your office

1184
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:48,860
when you are in a day

1185
01:15:48,860 --> 01:15:52,410
there's a powerful technique

1186
01:15:52,410 --> 01:15:57,920
disassociation never want to be a great
pickpocket learn

1187
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:03,679
us is all pickpockets do disassociate
you ever want the best defensive

1188
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:06,949
technique that somebody's gonna be true
but you need to stop him right then

1189
01:16:06,949 --> 01:16:13,390
wanna stalk me all it is is making their
brain process something it's not ready

1190
01:16:13,390 --> 01:16:14,219
to process

1191
01:16:14,219 --> 01:16:19,310
all this is J if I want to steal
somebody's batch because I want to get

1192
01:16:19,310 --> 01:16:20,320
in the facility

1193
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:25,670
I'm not gonna walk up and go all

1194
01:16:25,670 --> 01:16:30,030
hey look at that beer I can walk away
with a better

1195
01:16:30,030 --> 01:16:33,989
doing I scratched his beard is gone

1196
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:37,739
why badge walk to work

1197
01:16:37,739 --> 01:16:44,739
right somebody's getting ready and I've
actually uses a law enforcement officer

1198
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:46,270
several times

1199
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:50,300
you know somebody's getting ready this
guy that I engaged in the room

1200
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:54,410
that was wanting to kill me was a
disassociation technique a

1201
01:16:54,410 --> 01:17:00,130
what's have some scroll we talk about
killing me was disassociate from that

1202
01:17:00,130 --> 01:17:00,940
house in school

1203
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:06,750
you want that two seconds that saved her
life

1204
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:10,949
ladies when you know a big guy like me
who is

1205
01:17:10,949 --> 01:17:14,060
evil wants to actually do some bad stuff
to you

1206
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:19,380
that second when they're going to grab
you you know say something just

1207
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:26,380
ways not scream holler just like my
peter has shoes on can we go get it

1208
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:34,800
first of a home attacking you

1209
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:38,100
arm suddenly wondering whether you're
crazier than I am

1210
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:42,850
alright

1211
01:17:42,850 --> 01:17:47,480
and there's three types estimates that
emotional

1212
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:50,570
you know you're dealing with a
boyfriend/girlfriend they're solving

1213
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:51,730
under control

1214
01:17:51,730 --> 01:17:57,160
level earthly don't plan on your movie
for a while

1215
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:59,550
better

1216
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:02,150
but will transfer contacts out over ago
heard

1217
01:18:02,150 --> 01:18:05,750
our anchoring weirdo pollution expert
great

1218
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:11,330
anchoring all anchoring years as
classical conditioning take stimulus get

1219
01:18:11,330 --> 01:18:15,449
response to external skit response the
power really behind anchoring years

1220
01:18:15,449 --> 01:18:19,010
and what people don't understand in miss
user

1221
01:18:19,010 --> 01:18:22,610
is they don't match the anchors to the
right move dodi's

1222
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:27,180
so if your visual person and I'm certain
there sloppy on electron banker

1223
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:31,530
are going to work not going to work very
powerful a

1224
01:18:31,530 --> 01:18:35,960
I need to deal with your visual cues so
maybe I just go

1225
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:39,370
that's all my anchor maybe okay

1226
01:18:39,370 --> 01:18:42,710
I got it and I anchor what I wore

1227
01:18:42,710 --> 01:18:45,920
that's number one number two years

1228
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:48,949
don't go for the gusto right off the bat
people

1229
01:18:48,949 --> 01:18:53,050
you know that's what are my trust to do
when they learn anchoring

1230
01:18:53,050 --> 01:18:56,960
as they try to go okay this is what I
want to get it with an anchor now you

1231
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:58,290
may have to go six stops

1232
01:18:58,290 --> 01:19:01,480
you may have to anchor him scratching
his nose

1233
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:04,660
to giving up across the room get a glass
a water

1234
01:19:04,660 --> 01:19:10,530
to sitting down reading a book to then
handing you the ticket that you wanted

1235
01:19:10,530 --> 01:19:17,530
to begin with

1236
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:20,969
secret to getting out over ticket is
actually an anchoring technique

1237
01:19:20,969 --> 01:19:25,170
I kid you not arm

1238
01:19:25,170 --> 01:19:28,940
you know we were given though

1239
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:32,969
given the right active you know
judiciously policing people who were

1240
01:19:32,969 --> 01:19:34,340
drinking and driving so

1241
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:38,540
we would all have to check these people
and it is unfounded Lee

1242
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:42,869
consistent that when you stop somebody
who's been drinking in you said how much

1243
01:19:42,869 --> 01:19:44,849
have you had to drink tonight what's the
answer

1244
01:19:44,849 --> 01:19:48,360
two beers preserver

1245
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:52,239
you win the prize two beers I one night

1246
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:55,580
stop the lady and isometric

1247
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:59,400
how much be a drink tonight now I had
four beers that was over three hours and

1248
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:05,340
I won't go home what a

1249
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:09,719
whereas somebody needs a $2 beers we
didn't have a car at the very least

1250
01:20:09,719 --> 01:20:13,849
no a new that

1251
01:20:13,849 --> 01:20:16,889
she took my anchor unknowing

1252
01:20:16,889 --> 01:20:21,469
when somebody says two beers at the Y
and she'd be anchored

1253
01:20:21,469 --> 01:20:26,560
and should disassociate the same time by
saying for beers ovoid

1254
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:30,480
what I do with a person's been honest
with me go home

1255
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:37,480
and anchoring works both ways it works
anchoring somebody nd anchoring somebody

1256
01:20:38,349 --> 01:20:41,949
to go to think about that so that tech
support person that you're trying to

1257
01:20:41,949 --> 01:20:42,719
bypass

1258
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:47,449
has a very high acre which is I'm not
given anybody anything cuz they all look

1259
01:20:47,449 --> 01:20:48,980
like butt heads to marry

1260
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:54,020
father to get a deal maker that first

1261
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:58,599
and then get them with report to the
contacts with your wall

1262
01:20:58,599 --> 01:21:01,869
or take the anchors that are there

1263
01:21:01,869 --> 01:21:08,250
and go sideways to where you want it to
be this takes a lot of practice

1264
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:12,900
a very simple example of it which we can
all go home and try to nine

1265
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:17,110
you can do it to yourself are you can
have somebody help you out with those

1266
01:21:17,110 --> 01:21:21,469
bill a the most profound positive
context that you have

1267
01:21:21,469 --> 01:21:25,300
whether it's a trip to the beach whether
it's a time that you spent with her

1268
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:26,710
father loved one

1269
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:31,489
whatever it is and then reach down in
the middle of a building that is

1270
01:21:31,489 --> 01:21:32,730
intensely you can

1271
01:21:32,730 --> 01:21:37,750
squeeze your luck do that two or three
times

1272
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:44,219
tomorrow when you wake up squeeze your
legs and dole

1273
01:21:44,219 --> 01:21:48,599
and then determine how you feel that
you're not going to make

1274
01:21:48,599 --> 01:21:52,119
you're not missing a flash right back to
that moment but see if you don't feel

1275
01:21:52,119 --> 01:21:52,690
good

1276
01:21:52,690 --> 01:21:56,440
no matter whether you felt bad before

1277
01:21:56,440 --> 01:22:00,330
now

1278
01:22:00,330 --> 01:22:03,540
that may not work for a lot americans
love you may not may not be

1279
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:09,580
kinesthetic also squeezing your legs are
gonna do anything for you no more

1280
01:22:09,580 --> 01:22:15,110
so you may have to then trying to okay
we'll let me tap a spoon trial

1281
01:22:15,110 --> 01:22:19,460
the soho to help you explore your own
modalities and figure out what they are

1282
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:23,090
but will start beginning to teach and I
I highly encourage you to anchor some

1283
01:22:23,090 --> 01:22:24,469
positive things on yourself

1284
01:22:24,469 --> 01:22:28,840
before you start trying to do anything
females now

1285
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:33,199
you can't legitimately anchor people
sitting down

1286
01:22:33,199 --> 01:22:37,900
across from a table with them I've done
this in interviews and other types of

1287
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:38,449
things

1288
01:22:38,449 --> 01:22:42,239
were you know I'm not getting the speedo

1289
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:46,510
responses or whatever and so when they
give me that speedo

1290
01:22:46,510 --> 01:22:50,710
do some repetitive motion or you know
give him some time

1291
01:22:50,710 --> 01:22:54,310
and then I just keep doing that sign to
make speed up speed up speed up

1292
01:22:54,310 --> 01:23:00,349
so there's water things that you can do
with anchor

1293
01:23:00,349 --> 01:23:04,320
to go ahead as for Twitter

1294
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:08,380
I think I ran over for about the I

1295
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:15,380
tried to push this on any questions I
anchor dollar girl to sleep

1296
01:23:16,330 --> 01:23:20,880
a kid

1297
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:24,420
I think they I think they have a couple
yes

1298
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:31,420
her

1299
01:23:39,070 --> 01:23:43,510
yep does it is confrontational for a lot
of people because that's the contacts

1300
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:46,930
but mostly what it is its divisional
between people

1301
01:23:46,930 --> 01:23:49,960
and it's turned into confrontational
because

1302
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:54,230
superiors use that context to create a
confrontational

1303
01:23:54,230 --> 01:24:01,230
authority component

1304
01:24:12,730 --> 01:24:15,860
that's great that's wonderful

1305
01:24:15,860 --> 01:24:20,010
that tells you immediately what some I
tell me what that tells me about the

1306
01:24:20,010 --> 01:24:22,670
person are

1307
01:24:22,670 --> 01:24:25,870
is canister

1308
01:24:25,870 --> 01:24:29,960
he has to move movement is Krista

1309
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:34,780
secondly that's an easy thing to mereces
put your hands up in the air and Cherie

1310
01:24:34,780 --> 01:24:41,090
some hand puppets and talk to him back
they don't have to make sense believe it

1311
01:24:41,090 --> 01:24:41,670
or not

1312
01:24:41,670 --> 01:24:45,270
UK

1313
01:24:45,270 --> 01:24:49,410
but if you're doing this and he's doing
this know I like you know you might as

1314
01:24:49,410 --> 01:24:52,790
well turn around to each other face each
other's back and talk to each other

1315
01:24:52,790 --> 01:24:56,050
you're not getting each other you're not
connecting that's a report that you can

1316
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:57,300
add to that okay

1317
01:24:57,300 --> 01:25:01,650
and knowing that he's moving his hands
also kinda use your feeling how fast is

1318
01:25:01,650 --> 01:25:02,250
talking

1319
01:25:02,250 --> 01:25:09,250
what modality he's moving through as
he's doing okay

1320
01:25:13,969 --> 01:25:20,969
is called a PJC and if you haven't had
another speeding ticket in three years

1321
01:25:21,209 --> 01:25:28,209
it's a wonderful little thing to use
occasionally occur

1322
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:32,320
arm okay if you're dealing with the
Highway Patrol 0

1323
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:36,250
I'm on

1324
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:40,630
I'm being honest with you when you we
you know as a police officer may be very

1325
01:25:40,630 --> 01:25:41,989
candid with you

1326
01:25:41,989 --> 01:25:45,980
we do have quotas you know an A

1327
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:50,060
speeding ticket is considered an arrest
so when we have so many quotas for us

1328
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:50,960
that we have to do

1329
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:54,170
is not that if we don't have you know
five a day

1330
01:25:54,170 --> 01:25:57,580
that we're gonna like go to jail
ourselves but are sergeant starts

1331
01:25:57,580 --> 01:25:58,780
working out is going on

1332
01:25:58,780 --> 01:26:02,190
you know Highway Patrol

1333
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:06,570
the best thing you can do with the
Highway Patrol is do exactly what you

1334
01:26:06,570 --> 01:26:09,380
should which is put your hands on the
top of the steering wheel

1335
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:14,370
you know talk nice to them the one thing
you should never do in a speeding ticket

1336
01:26:14,370 --> 01:26:16,010
scenario is acknowledge

1337
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:19,270
any crime just say I don't know

1338
01:26:19,270 --> 01:26:22,580
why did you call me oh I'm wasn't sure I
you know

1339
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:26,110
I'll tell you one way I got over
speeding ticket with the Highway Patrol

1340
01:26:26,110 --> 01:26:29,159
wasn't in the state side on other work
arm

1341
01:26:29,159 --> 01:26:32,409
a private shot nowadays as trigger-happy
is with more

1342
01:26:32,409 --> 01:26:36,239
but it worked there so I came flying
over this hill

1343
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:40,780
follow Highway Patrol my first thought
was to keep on flying in five a side

1344
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:42,179
street in harlem

1345
01:26:42,179 --> 01:26:46,719
but he whipped a row I saw so I
immediately pulled over

1346
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:49,909
that's one thing you don't want to do
you will person officer all

1347
01:26:49,909 --> 01:26:53,699
if you do want two things when you pull
over pull over to stupid place your

1348
01:26:53,699 --> 01:26:57,940
personal opinion to yourself to do it
it's make them ride for two or three

1349
01:26:57,940 --> 01:27:00,810
miles into the ball over at your
convenience

1350
01:27:00,810 --> 01:27:04,199
you get three tickets alright

1351
01:27:04,199 --> 01:27:08,469
but I mean really pulled over and what i
did.

1352
01:27:08,469 --> 01:27:11,560
is as soon as he stopped his car

1353
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:15,100
I jumped outta my car with running back
to his 100 said

1354
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:19,620
thank God I was about to fall so quiet
man if you have to stop 2010 prior and

1355
01:27:19,620 --> 01:27:20,840
Mark or

1356
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:27,840
he looked at me for like five minutes
there was a maternity

1357
01:27:29,310 --> 01:27:32,719
he does also on

1358
01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:36,199
there's a coffee shop down the road you
get my call right now you get down there

1359
01:27:36,199 --> 01:27:37,190
decrease in profit

1360
01:27:37,190 --> 01:27:44,190
the reason why did you shot nowadays
they're very i mean they want you to

1361
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:45,440
assume a car

1362
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:48,739
now was a calculated risk on my part arm

1363
01:27:48,739 --> 01:27:52,929
but it was one type of effectively that
day no I mean

1364
01:27:52,929 --> 01:27:57,070
the the one thing you can do with police
officers remember

1365
01:27:57,070 --> 01:28:01,270
here's what police officers the if the
smart ones were in very quickly

1366
01:28:01,270 --> 01:28:05,580
so you do with each other and other
people all the time

1367
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:09,449
the only time to do with the police
officers when you get your ass be

1368
01:28:09,449 --> 01:28:13,090
your house stole your stuff solo your
health are you in a spender

1369
01:28:13,090 --> 01:28:17,590
for your contacts to a police officer is
typically

1370
01:28:17,590 --> 01:28:21,739
anchored very negatively which means

1371
01:28:21,739 --> 01:28:25,380
we know that we come all and we're gorda

1372
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:31,670
so the more you can be conducive to the
officer doing his job simply easily

1373
01:28:31,670 --> 01:28:35,760
and fun the better off you gonna be

1374
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:39,250
I would say more than fifty percent of
the time

1375
01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:43,179
the decision to give you a ticket or not
is largely made

1376
01:28:43,179 --> 01:28:47,420
you can if he's on the borough on with
the you might be able to 4 p.m.

1377
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:52,020
are being funny here not sarcastic watch
sarcasm

1378
01:28:52,020 --> 01:28:55,860
cops have a very low tolerance for the

1379
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:59,710
okay but being dis-

1380
01:28:59,710 --> 01:29:04,230
you know easy to get along with with but
the only thing I can tell you

1381
01:29:04,230 --> 01:29:08,010
and with the highway patrol that
spraying very close to zero

1382
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:13,360
anything else alright

1383
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:20,360
yes

1384
01:29:23,630 --> 01:29:28,030
well first well first off

1385
01:29:28,030 --> 01:29:31,770
on some your arm movements Tommy the no
the way you constructed

1386
01:29:31,770 --> 01:29:35,040
things was in a feeling modality arm

1387
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:38,920
so greatly you used words that were that
were

1388
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:44,200
marginally feeling if if you're not been
feeling I would have contacted use

1389
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:49,450
as a mobility digital because you you
more than anything else you

1390
01:29:49,450 --> 01:29:53,130
you were completely absent visual or
auditory things when you're talking

1391
01:29:53,130 --> 01:29:54,310
about visual or auditory

1392
01:29:54,310 --> 01:29:58,630
things which tends to produce a memo to
probe being a feeling type person

1393
01:29:58,630 --> 01:30:05,630
the Oratory came about because I
movement that's mainly what I saw

1394
01:30:11,170 --> 01:30:14,280
no I'm actually the guy this enormous
them back in the room this

1395
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:21,280
like watching people morning go

1396
01:30:36,290 --> 01:30:39,240
it depends on whether you wanna have fun
or whether you wanna make them feel like

1397
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:40,010
a jackass

1398
01:30:40,010 --> 01:30:41,369
to be honest

1399
01:30:41,369 --> 01:30:44,859
I have many people dance around like
monkeys on cocaine

1400
01:30:44,859 --> 01:30:48,939
who are detected were marrying me I
would speed up my movements and I would

1401
01:30:48,939 --> 01:30:49,269
like

1402
01:30:49,269 --> 01:30:54,449
over overdue lemme you know overby jump
around inner-city

1403
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:59,199
you know not go from four to back on
board american and they're trying to

1404
01:30:59,199 --> 01:31:00,269
follow me %um

1405
01:31:00,269 --> 01:31:03,590
you also get to a point where they're
doing that so much that they're like

1406
01:31:03,590 --> 01:31:07,280
they're not hearing a word you're saying
about

1407
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:10,310
for you cancer adding stupid phrases
amerilite you know

1408
01:31:10,310 --> 01:31:14,510
your erode you got a green face today
builders go now

1409
01:31:14,510 --> 01:31:18,360
home you know so you have a lot of fun
with people like the

1410
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:25,360
ask her

1411
01:31:27,659 --> 01:31:30,999
yes good question actual question so

1412
01:31:30,999 --> 01:31:35,549
everything with us when we talk about
body language earlier

1413
01:31:35,549 --> 01:31:39,179
that's one of the things reason why so
defensive body language is only

1414
01:31:39,179 --> 01:31:40,379
marginally useful

1415
01:31:40,379 --> 01:31:43,760
use it only takes a sheet of anything to

1416
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:47,589
to totally modify the meeting at very
similarly

1417
01:31:47,589 --> 01:31:51,039
everything up to the actual I accessing
cues

1418
01:31:51,039 --> 01:31:54,899
you have to like read the whole person
can understand

1419
01:31:54,899 --> 01:31:58,139
in mind getting something that bill same
here and if you don't

1420
01:31:58,139 --> 01:32:01,769
there may be some underlying issue going
on

1421
01:32:01,769 --> 01:32:05,019
now the I accessing cues actually work

1422
01:32:05,019 --> 01:32:08,709
pretty effectively even on people who
were

1423
01:32:08,709 --> 01:32:12,969
well beyond the norm now you do reach a
stage with the

1424
01:32:12,969 --> 01:32:16,209
where all that stuff brake saw

1425
01:32:16,209 --> 01:32:20,999
but the the thing that you gotta learn
to do is not depend on any one of these

1426
01:32:20,999 --> 01:32:23,599
things you've got to mess with embossing
does

1427
01:32:23,599 --> 01:32:27,699
make you step back and look at this and
go okay I'm saying this guy go from

1428
01:32:27,699 --> 01:32:30,719
visual auditory kinesthetic his order to
use the ghetto

1429
01:32:30,719 --> 01:32:35,129
something's wrong with that people don't
do that today

1430
01:32:35,129 --> 01:32:39,779
so maybe I need to turn off and see what
a bigger pictures going on here for a

1431
01:32:39,779 --> 01:32:40,119
minute

1432
01:32:40,119 --> 01:32:44,039
autistic people really easy to pick up

1433
01:32:44,039 --> 01:32:48,959
even in the most subtle autism not
because of anything else other than they

1434
01:32:48,959 --> 01:32:49,309
will

1435
01:32:49,309 --> 01:32:54,269
demonstrate little subtle non social
things that you can go

1436
01:32:54,269 --> 01:33:00,649
at and film right and those are the
things that you start working out

1437
01:33:00,649 --> 01:33:06,199
um I will tell you that once you get
into abnormal behavior

1438
01:33:06,199 --> 01:33:10,389
about the only thing you can do with
abnormal behavior people and I'll tell

1439
01:33:10,389 --> 01:33:13,819
you a real quick story it's funny I hope
but do not offend anybody who's

1440
01:33:13,819 --> 01:33:14,760
religious and your

1441
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:19,889
I meant nothing by it arm but you gotta
get into the context that the abnormal

1442
01:33:19,889 --> 01:33:23,349
I'm normal behavioral person's head
that's only thing you can do

1443
01:33:23,349 --> 01:33:26,619
and work with side that context I L

1444
01:33:26,619 --> 01:33:29,809
my had 280 to eighty year old

1445
01:33:29,809 --> 01:33:33,099
plus ladies who were gonna have certain
the one of them

1446
01:33:33,099 --> 01:33:36,309
sisters are which ones were going to
have surgery but

1447
01:33:36,309 --> 01:33:39,939
the one that was having surgery had a
psychological disorder so they had to

1448
01:33:39,939 --> 01:33:41,649
put her on the site for four

1449
01:33:41,649 --> 01:33:45,789
a week to stabilize or whatever other
mad that they were going to use while

1450
01:33:45,789 --> 01:33:46,829
they were doing surgery

1451
01:33:46,829 --> 01:33:50,619
and i got to know or really well because
every night she had my keys in a room or

1452
01:33:50,619 --> 01:33:51,569
something like that

1453
01:33:51,569 --> 01:33:55,529
the nurses wouldn't do this but i just
goin' sure to get a little worried

1454
01:33:55,529 --> 01:34:00,329
maker happy should grossly don't and I
think her name was a

1455
01:34:00,329 --> 01:34:03,329
now II cannot remember for life for me

1456
01:34:03,329 --> 01:34:07,249
but we got up to the search which got up
to third 400 surgery

1457
01:34:07,249 --> 01:34:10,709
you know the doctor needed to get up
that day and walk

1458
01:34:10,709 --> 01:34:14,029
as they do with most people after they
have surgery

1459
01:34:14,029 --> 01:34:18,169
and every time she would just the nurses
would just about to get up

1460
01:34:18,169 --> 01:34:23,229
her twin sister had this kind of you
know dialogue thing going on and and the

1461
01:34:23,229 --> 01:34:23,649
sister

1462
01:34:23,649 --> 01:34:26,849
oh my god to cart me over the bull

1463
01:34:26,849 --> 01:34:30,889
earlier would fall back in the bed just
well and so they called me up there like

1464
01:34:30,889 --> 01:34:32,219
wood she's got a walk

1465
01:34:32,219 --> 01:34:35,839
we cannot get her up the sister keeps
you know

1466
01:34:35,839 --> 01:34:39,949
undermining this read she's gotta watch
my daughter in there and I had a lil bit

1467
01:34:39,949 --> 01:34:41,119
more report I thought

1468
01:34:41,119 --> 01:34:45,029
occurred side got it in a setting up in
we started stand I'm sure enough the

1469
01:34:45,029 --> 01:34:46,619
twin sister does this again

1470
01:34:46,619 --> 01:34:50,029
when and it just goes limp you know

1471
01:34:50,029 --> 01:34:55,379
I'm sitting there thinking for men in we
had talked a lot about Bible and stuff

1472
01:34:55,379 --> 01:34:55,979
and

1473
01:34:55,979 --> 01:34:59,199
religious context my father is a pastor
by the way so

1474
01:34:59,199 --> 01:35:03,319
you know I can talk religion with anyone
pretty much and

1475
01:35:03,319 --> 01:35:08,369
so wish we had this kinda report going
on and I thought for a min ago gotta get

1476
01:35:08,369 --> 01:35:09,539
her out so I looked I went

1477
01:35:09,539 --> 01:35:13,510
in do you believe

1478
01:35:13,510 --> 01:35:17,649
in the healing power more jews
Christians you know I do look we've

1479
01:35:17,649 --> 01:35:18,329
talked about

1480
01:35:18,329 --> 01:35:21,799
as a look at me as a

1481
01:35:21,799 --> 01:35:26,179
right now want you to understand this
and believe this rise and be real

1482
01:35:26,179 --> 01:35:31,929
I kid you not this woman stood straight
up and start walking

1483
01:35:31,929 --> 01:35:35,629
there were five nurses sparing you the
doorway dorm

1484
01:35:35,629 --> 01:35:41,249
in evert when sister stopped her crap it
was like

1485
01:35:41,249 --> 01:35:48,249
her call

1486
01:35:51,410 --> 01:35:58,410
I just thought it was funny actually
others time the good

1487
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:03,790
resources out there that's why use the
language no use for the best

1488
01:36:03,790 --> 01:36:04,750
technologies

1489
01:36:04,750 --> 01:36:08,370
I'm you'll find a lot of information on
our linguistic programming water

1490
01:36:08,370 --> 01:36:09,700
resources around the

1491
01:36:09,700 --> 01:36:15,040
arm language is something the you can
probably spinoff of summer those because

1492
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:15,450
they

1493
01:36:15,450 --> 01:36:19,030
Lautner linguistic program you very much
about learning the language as well

1494
01:36:19,030 --> 01:36:22,730
body language believe about half the
stuff look at more the offense a body

1495
01:36:22,730 --> 01:36:24,400
language than the defense or because

1496
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:28,080
innately we have the the kind of
understanding what body language means

1497
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:30,350
we responsible consciously to what we
see

1498
01:36:30,350 --> 01:36:34,280
perceive in Somer's body language bomb
like this year like this guy's open yeah

1499
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:38,470
on like this you like this guy's clothes
right we do that so

1500
01:36:38,470 --> 01:36:41,550
boser you'll see on the slides those
names go find you

1501
01:36:41,550 --> 01:36:46,350
the other storms resources up arm

1502
01:36:46,350 --> 01:36:50,180
actually the best thing to all my other
some sites for the

1503
01:36:50,180 --> 01:36:53,680
but there's some but you can find on
Amazon they're just fun reading

1504
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:56,880
their old history you of prawns and con
artist

1505
01:36:56,880 --> 01:37:01,380
and the cons at the pool of the language
to use and what they ended up doing in

1506
01:37:01,380 --> 01:37:04,730
that whole gamut of things unless it's
fun reading I'll be honest with you

1507
01:37:04,730 --> 01:37:08,630
alright does

1508
01:37:08,630 --> 01:37:11,220
was good though a report from I'll
prepare for
