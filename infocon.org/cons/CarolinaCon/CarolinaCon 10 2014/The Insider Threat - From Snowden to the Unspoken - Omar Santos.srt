1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,560
joint also

2
00:00:12,309 --> 00:00:16,150
Cheers

3
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:19,540
alright so well I have a friend

4
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,080
who goes by the democrats is this awards
are for suckers

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,250
animations are hard a mentor

6
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,540
you three and then I just so knows
mercker actually doing some computer

7
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,570
there with the

8
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,570
bash the slights so they're too cool to
have mostly

9
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,879
nah I'm just getting actually I'm
suiting

10
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,320
inning here one another strip and the

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,510
also converting that into Python you
actually have a model number you can do

12
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:51,030
bust or it's like to bite them big
disclaimer

13
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,570
of course like we always have to do this
presentation is based only in my opinion

14
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:59,899
only me acting and we go along and only
by myself

15
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm wrong I'm an idiot I'm clueless
among educated

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,119
and I'm just the train pigeon or dozen

17
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,869
go over any opinions of my employer my
friends

18
00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:14,810
my mom and dad anybody else so I'm

19
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,250
they set up the road this might affect I
should not be the one

20
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,429
speaking about this because I have no
clue about this thing I think that

21
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:25,190
the industry as a whole has no clue
about the insider threat if not we will

22
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,140
not have it right now

23
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:30,270
but the I want to actually learn from
you the

24
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,679
is that over mu you learn from me much

25
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:38,470
but all-star with some some historical
background he writes 0

26
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,959
there have been many studies regarding
the third read the concert actually has

27
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:42,259
a

28
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:45,270
really good program how many of you are
familiar with the program from certain

29
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,170
point to it

30
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,090
problem you invite you to actually go
there there probably one of the best

31
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:54,060
the a loose from their case body so much
you know

32
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,170
go over some other case studies here im
but a anyway this thread is actually

33
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,490
you know it's you know the I think that
whenever

34
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:07,209
and I however the sliding here but
whenever we talk about you celebrate of

35
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:08,250
course the first thing is

36
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,470
snoring right so I want it they will not
one for now

37
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:15,150
to asthma but whatever if a safe noting

38
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,300
or you think not and we have a lot to
drink so

39
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,480
bring but according to Forrester

40
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,420
from the study that they actually did
last year

41
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,760
the top horse or and most of the
breaches were

42
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,380
insiders on them this story actually
indicated that she

43
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,930
one and did a study with North American
companies and also

44
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,640
European companies they pick them there
fortune 500 will

45
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,760
in the neural and im the

46
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,180
indicated only 42 percent of them them

47
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,310
have receiving someone with training

48
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,340
but only as a cutie poses 0 they
actually insider threat

49
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,990
was not news to anyone only seven 57
percent actually say that

50
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:06,530
they even all Iraqi police is in place
of course everybody under

51
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:11,490
you know behind they're getting you know
own right now if you can call it that

52
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,650
way this is not a

53
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,820
a technical problem into going to the
build-up but you know

54
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,720
im many many many companies
organizations the government

55
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,580
friends and everybody is nowadays are

56
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,780
are a victim of winter retreat one of
the things that I

57
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,220
his typical about this is that you can
actually do all the static analysis in

58
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,910
the world you can do black box testing
and computers

59
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:38,560
you can do you know them to get a scam
you can actually mean or reverse

60
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,780
engineer home what you think

61
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,470
but you never you know what it inside if
somebody's mind on purely sexually

62
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:49,270
is so that's one of the things the you
know it is a lot different from now so

63
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,300
I mean this is something that you
probably have seen me see if I

64
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:52,990
completely

65
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:59,030
here ok we have are you don't know what
im

66
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:06,030
unit

67
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,209
yeah

68
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:14,870
we go reviews identified

69
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,229
treading gaps in DOD his ability to do
to detect

70
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:21,870
prevent and respond instances were

71
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,340
someone working for Rush a government
employee

72
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:30,330
member their military or contractor
decides to inflict harm on this

73
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,800
institution and its people

74
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,590
I am directing the Department to
establish automated reviews have cleared

75
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,430
personnel

76
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,460
that will continuously Paul information

77
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,510
from law enforcement and other relevant
databases

78
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,610
increasingly threats cyber

79
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:51,020
kinetic of threats there inside the
perimeter

80
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,650
what the Department of Defense should do
is billed

81
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,910
security from within well no shit
Sherlock

82
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:04,210
the so her right now seventy five
percent

83
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,880
the of the attack you know the bridge is
likely the excavation the

84
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,710
up beta happens within hours however

85
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:15,699
the holy shit also thank you thank you

86
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:19,440
so im however over 54 percent over
packed

87
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,599
now you crazy the over 50 for personal
attacks her

88
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:26,910
left the on detective per month not that
gap

89
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:31,370
year after year is increasing now this
is the gap

90
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:35,150
for the technical stuff for the people
you know for the companies in the world

91
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,150
are selling

92
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:39,760
you know intrusion detection systems up
our walls and everything

93
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,020
the and we see that think that go up

94
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:47,010
and is mostly because an operational
perspective upping but if you compare

95
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,860
that into the insider threat

96
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,220
you can even put numbers into it because
you don't know when

97
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,340
really inside somebody's mind you know
something is actually happening so does

98
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:56,620
the

99
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,820
main thing but there's a lot of
traditional indicators that

100
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:05,240
the people looking technology that in
this case like you do not apply

101
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,360
again you know I can bombard you with a
whole bunch of the day but

102
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,260
again the inside of the road

103
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:16,330
may never be detected until the 30 too
late tune

104
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:20,159
so how many of you in here

105
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:23,190
have been asked to a good deal now
within for

106
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,340
if you have any particular program and
everything yep

107
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:32,849
why do you think you that one is already
happening well

108
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:37,370
nope yet

109
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:41,860
dust does another one ahead that's
actually more than one other cases

110
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:48,860
you know that be number one issue later
well

111
00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:00,710
you and then the main reason that you
guys are you going to your

112
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:04,360
is because they always bingo let me give
this problem to the nerds though figured

113
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:04,879
out right

114
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,749
the not so actually that's a

115
00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:12,020
interesting fact this is for the most
part

116
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,499
not a technical problem behavior problem
in all go with that

117
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:19,319
so what is an insider you know that you
mentioned you know it current or former

118
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:22,159
employees that is probably pissed off a
contractor that

119
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:25,580
you know is you how some other you know
motives

120
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,870
a no go into the modem the in a bit it
can be a business partner

121
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,090
the anybody that actually has access to
somebody's data

122
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:37,620
right or somebody's property that's an
insider the motivations go from money

123
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,669
that I'm pissed though

124
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:42,550
you know if you listen politic reasons
her revenge

125
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,669
somewhat searching of course you know if
you're working poor

126
00:07:46,669 --> 00:07:51,219
for government you know that maybe
another resume her and the other thing

127
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:51,919
is that the

128
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,370
owning than that insider the know the
dumb people out there

129
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,699
like actually you mention the right so
its

130
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:03,449
hoping for a lil authorized evil right
so the guys

131
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:08,620
in most cases are already authorized the
and the

132
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:12,300
you know courses now a battle between
what is actually good

133
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,659
and what is evil there is the known bad
right

134
00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:19,399
so you you know it's okay I can probably
do with some water with

135
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:23,729
can if you can call it that way were
known but there's also this some good

136
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:27,550
right but which one is it right

137
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:31,789
whenever it comes to that you cannot
tell right the other one is the

138
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:36,440
what Michael harming right the what I
can tell you who to hire me know my name

139
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,260
is Omar something like that they said I

140
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,649
workforce is corny but the good or the
bad news for Cisco from a technical

141
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:42,449
perspective

142
00:08:42,449 --> 00:08:45,519
bottom is again you know

143
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,000
one of the things that I attracts me a
lot these the the

144
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,100
I'm the science if I can call it that
way or

145
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,790
the human behavior and the motives
overload on the attack

146
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,990
that are actually been extremely
successful not so much of that Act for

147
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,579
the things that are actually happening

148
00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:04,040
right now in the industry and a lot of
them

149
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,100
you know right now and I'm not gonna
during commission that name

150
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,279
but is kinda it unavoidable

151
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:14,569
to it yeah

152
00:09:14,569 --> 00:09:20,540
because it does he know

153
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,740
the house the ripple effect on everyone
anyways

154
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:28,720
the I have to drink use that let's do it
a little bit

155
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,519
insider 3 trivia here right so watching
how many we are familiar with this

156
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:36,050
Biggs Woodring specifically looks like
me right there

157
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:39,899
wanted awesome

158
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:43,029
ongoing nobody of so I was in Knoxville

159
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:47,089
or append the summit but two weeks ago
and I saw this at a bar in was

160
00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:50,160
kinda like that gonna drunk whenever

161
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,589
noted but the then I'd fine though the
duck you have here they have a lovely

162
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:55,410
thing often

163
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,480
we were basically is trivia people get
you know the drunken

164
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,600
they go on and do different public
tropical

165
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,170
so I'll do a little bit of trivia here
again starting from the obvious

166
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:09,149
who's that what it

167
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:16,149
he she it boo as the what 0

168
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,000
early go

169
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,300
weeklies so on yeah it's

170
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,760
such who you are you know so more there

171
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,430
excuse me is one of the guys that of
course is the

172
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:41,200
all the rampage about weeklies what this
guy make it harder

173
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,650
not

174
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:50,740
so quite yep

175
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,950
also

176
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:58,000
yes no

177
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,200
actually a smart but we r with my team
had to help

178
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,910
those guys whenever that happens anyways
-ism

179
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:08,640
Robert Hansen who the good others too
easy

180
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:14,950
yet who's that chick why I'll

181
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:19,470
you're rolling you work with I

182
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,780
so some additional examples the

183
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:26,200
this just happened may bit myron in the
great leader

184
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,300
so basically say that maybe there was a
guy that it was an administrator that

185
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:30,900
apparently

186
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,480
you know he actually claims youth hacker
the

187
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,200
but I don't know who was actually
factory or kung fu but the actress told

188
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,910
me know

189
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:42,050
confidential data and of course in now
its

190
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,190
is being prosecuted there is a tip

191
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:49,450
seven-year-old just actually happen this
is an interesting case study

192
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:52,690
the smoke that most of these case
studies either came from certain

193
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:56,440
from public records I'm not disclosing
anything that is not public

194
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,790
so others by Miller there's a technology
company

195
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:04,980
I'm gonna say the name that to business
partners both of them

196
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,660
actually have confidential data
basically they had to share

197
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,900
with technology company a that
confidential data

198
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,080
in one of them actually it was what made
the company

199
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:20,060
be what company be is so almost the
crown jewels of the company

200
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,950
so there comes the awesome administrator

201
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:27,640
from that company and he was like holy
got me know

202
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,270
these are some corners of my company now
has images in my resume the both of them

203
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:35,700
and then he actually got over letters
from both of them

204
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,950
got higher and he accepted 21

205
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,950
but before that actually he downloaded

206
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:46,220
you know those confidential documents on
to come along took pic only completely

207
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:49,890
whenever another guy from technology
companies the the

208
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:53,600
so some all information that they should
not have

209
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,460
gotten that he reported out of course he
got caught when he got caught about you

210
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,190
and I have letter

211
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:02,600
right so it was too late there is a

212
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,390
little hint though their her little
problem is a day I do not care problem

213
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:09,530
as well right so now that we're talking
about business partnership and

214
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,030
everything

215
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:13,290
is that it'll typically companies

216
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:16,330
1 we're too busy to care

217
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:19,790
and two its truly not really

218
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,270
in our head our problem what happens to
my business partner

219
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:27,100
right so mean it is it is what it is
book

220
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:31,480
we have to recognize that we depend on
their ability to be able to

221
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,140
secure them so soul because they can
also become

222
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:39,180
either an insider or threat or even know
you got to actually come from them and

223
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,950
everything especially when we talk about

224
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:44,060
even clout base providers right so

225
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:47,870
so that's another thing is that that I
do not care moment

226
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,280
or that I do not care sentiment has to
change

227
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,700
right and yes your cases we cannot do
much about it

228
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,810
and of course the we have our hands
tight

229
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,970
release you can recognize that such a
threat

230
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:04,940
so whenever you have to deal with them
whenever you have to actually

231
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:09,240
you know either have some contractual
agreement to be to be able to identify

232
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,270
the risk that are there

233
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:15,740
mitigate this risk right now the other
thing about insider threats

234
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:19,750
israeli again is not a technical thing
but you know the whole BYOB

235
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,140
stop by minimum again like company will

236
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,250
the cells the premier li was a matter of
trust

237
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,380
right so if I think my phone

238
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,970
sorry that Michael someone if I think my
phone

239
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:37,140
and I walk out to one on my lap and
we're probably creating a new

240
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:41,040
product that is going to revolutionize
the industry

241
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,400
and I think a picture I think pictures
of the new document

242
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,610
and a Senate panel by Fortune word will
ship

243
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,960
it but not what but

244
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,760
me

245
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,810
me me

246
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,620
picture

247
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:05,010
from 237 is the same thing tendon
subjects

248
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:09,640
I love my wife the know this is an
option another case study

249
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,340
I have not slept with a case study but
this is actually pretty particular

250
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:18,210
Biscay is not US foreigner

251
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:21,820
and this didn't happen the US this
happen overseas

252
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:26,060
but he was actually married to a lady
from

253
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:31,200
Pakistan and he worked in the department
where you actually put the terrorist

254
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:31,680
list

255
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,790
names he was really really really really
really pissed off his wife

256
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:39,160
and she was visiting her family in
Pakistan up

257
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,780
he put her on the list i'm for three
years she was not able to come back to

258
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,620
the country

259
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,800
on the he got he got away with it

260
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:54,160
their own so how do you deal with that
yeah

261
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,940
but if the 100 bucks in over there

262
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,510
it a here so that some

263
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:04,800
you know some crazy call for their the
young

264
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:11,760
vehemently may split my way lol module

265
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,930
that up

266
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:19,970
it didn't yeah I do have been the worst
so

267
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:25,540
that's that's a good thing no doing some
more

268
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,940
so there's also the

269
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,440
idea of the unintentional insider on my
apologies

270
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,890
you can bro not read this thing here but
the first one

271
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:39,960
the the first thing that much in the
meat increase this because I can really

272
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,300
that

273
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:45,830
is attention the the lack of attention a
person sometimes can contribute to

274
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:49,690
you know doing dumb things right the you
know just being

275
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:53,250
don't know go ahead the other one is
puppy

276
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:56,930
in in some other cases from certain they
found out that im

277
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:00,480
I think was a contributor to a couple
that their cases

278
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,750
thing we're from 2000 7 2008 so

279
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,900
and then they're all other several

280
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:13,160
to cases you know it of course official
taxes on people to click in the emails

281
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,310
on their businesses for

282
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:18,030
the going going that but the other one
is also stress on sale

283
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:21,550
right and as a matter of fact even the
fault

284
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:25,040
there may be an insider maybe whatever
you want to call

285
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,000
ends coming fluctuated that type of
stress

286
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,140
the purple you know and Siri oh my god
you know my

287
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,490
your boss's boss boss told me that we
have to bring this report that we have

288
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:37,570
to senate we have to give minute
information

289
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:41,820
all the democrats right the that can
contribute to the prone to

290
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,840
there's no borrowing held on help you in
that way

291
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,080
the other thing there some other
interesting finders the maturity of the

292
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,820
insiders blunder activities before

293
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,050
not really I mean that again have to
study that but

294
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:58,200
the second one is the maturity of the
insiders it came to the attention

295
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,340
the or the maturities as I did you know

296
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:05,500
word somewhat detected so what did the

297
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:10,100
somebody beam problematic or unusual
behavior like drinking during a

298
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,020
presentation

299
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,680
or a.m.

300
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,870
and other ones is that all their site
information about insiders

301
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:21,780
invention some plans but they actually
did not share that information with

302
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,970
anybody because the word

303
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,730
the free though they were gonna get
caught and again the sources to

304
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,850
the you know several studies from the
secret service answered

305
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:33,970
wherever goes now this is our other

306
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:38,510
interesting things seventy-six percent
of the insiders develop lining up buns

307
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:42,730
to harm the organization's so this was
we're not like somebody I would

308
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:46,590
just got this today I'm gonna put you
know something then when I retrieve

309
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,750
information tomorrow I just got hired by
this company I'm gonna de lo these

310
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,970
documents will be

311
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:54,080
you know my first promotional whatever
the case may be right

312
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,540
the other thing is that in forty percent
of the cases involved

313
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:01,050
it was over you know behaviors in
preparation overall the incidence

314
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:07,550
and 15 percent of the cases in there
were actually picnic elections think to

315
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,240
take place

316
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,780
in order to carry the attacks you see
that number is pretty little

317
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:15,980
rate you would expect the technical
stuff will be he will be there right

318
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:21,070
I don't know created some buzz tomorrow
where you know to be able to like the

319
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,330
information or something now

320
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:25,880
I mean that the basic stuff is what is
actually happening right here

321
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,270
them one-third well

322
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:36,270
my ok with you sucks day me

323
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:42,550
that is true also want their authors as
I type it but you know

324
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,640
bid have to do with foreign governor
government

325
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,940
and the store is watching based on US
based company so that's why

326
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:54,740
was there so them what is the
recommendation ya you actually have to

327
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,250
pay attention to your crown jewels

328
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,840
and im you know of course be a vision of
what is the most critical intellectual

329
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,830
property have a protect against

330
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:05,750
you know we're oceans over access
control to that if easier said than done

331
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,390
believe me

332
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:09,700
even though in some cases your
organization may actually have many many

333
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,850
many pound you so many many Kingston

334
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:15,190
kingdoms inflated that is pretty me know

335
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:18,190
amazing to to accomplish there's always

336
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:22,550
the police said than done but im
although thing is that it happily cases

337
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:26,540
go you know all the individuals have
information about those inside a blunt

338
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:32,160
and those included coworkers 32 percent
acquaintances 20 percent family members

339
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:37,170
friends only 36 percent of the cases
there were multiple individuals involved

340
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,200
into this problem

341
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,390
right so when neither multiple people
pissed off or multiple people make money

342
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:46,430
multiple people actually beginning
higher by

343
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:50,340
you know the company even though they're
working for another entity

344
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:55,330
again one of the things that I cannot
stress enough is the insiders in most

345
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:55,870
cases

346
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:59,670
are not Packers it so you and some other
cases the catching have some

347
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:04,070
cool calm cool to comport you know some
moves in there but typically they're not

348
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:07,400
really hikers but they also often cause

349
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,520
you know the most either reputation by
Mitchell

350
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:14,050
or money that much right that's another
thing is that there are combing through

351
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:15,590
is strong in their site

352
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:20,440
rate tune most the tools or products
that we have right now

353
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,750
are designed for hackers they're not the
time for insider threats they cannot

354
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,590
scan your mind

355
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:27,720
the there some behavioral analysis you
can actually do

356
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,920
there some rocket stove though you can
also do but

357
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,980
you know when it comes to punish by an
insider the

358
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,960
you know if I will that be is not going
on you know you can write us nor

359
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,050
signature

360
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:43,160
to pick up to any insider if it's just
gonna act right now and unusually

361
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:47,520
if its action is going to take a picture
of your new with you buy something

362
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,430
leap right in some

363
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:55,120
most cases things that are not
technically should buy it so

364
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,430
a group the reprimand actually Patrick
reading is this year so

365
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:03,360
FBI actually a really good presentation
and in black had last year

366
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,310
regarding the Senate red he actually has
a group thing is that a good story for

367
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,630
provincial focus and

368
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:12,040
the parents not depiction and basically

369
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,230
he is suggesting that we should
crowdsource

370
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:18,340
security in a way that we shoe

371
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,830
you know have with security number Katie
out there

372
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:25,160
we typically do that and I show put my

373
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,370
I guess it's cool had no we do that
Cisco with technology

374
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:32,040
right so every business unit I mean we
hope a we have

375
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,620
with with harpley after her middle of
the count of how many products with her

376
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:40,030
1 a.m. we have so many business units
are there

377
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:43,920
on the the only way that we can actually
you know similar the information even

378
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,680
know what

379
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,620
its impact they're not is by
implementing automation and by

380
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,980
implementing croat sourcing

381
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:52,330
of security so if you think that same
thing arrow

382
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:55,640
the the technical and implement that

383
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:00,580
to behavioral right than you know that
but hopefully will spread

384
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:04,380
right positive social im engineering

385
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,960
it's another thing to create an
environment to persuade the purse

386
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,340
positive environment it's not like
holding hands and singing Kumbaya

387
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,780
does not never been applied right but be
able to detect

388
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:18,720
if there's such a problematic areas of
your company right then work with

389
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,740
management there's pro-army problematic
areas with their

390
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:26,340
company that people are really pissed
off then be able to be picked up

391
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,630
the im again in most cases

392
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:33,290
a lot easier said than done no going
back into the

393
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:38,650
very basic them technical stuff but you
can probably do too

394
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,710
they're very small in some cases even
the

395
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:46,700
free stuff like BNs and things like that
law

396
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,830
they can be your friend right so for
example

397
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:54,290
why in the hill at three o'clock in the
morning

398
00:23:54,290 --> 00:24:00,740
i'm talking to an embargo country if I
my companies in the US

399
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,980
but yeah

400
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,220
yet was the one way it doesn't want her
wake of course

401
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:10,380
and then up you know why we're not
looking up from the beginning

402
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:14,380
right where we started to talking to all
these in here you can read a book you

403
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,300
know

404
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:19,290
gonna go beginning country another thing
is that they will lose enough things

405
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:19,890
under

406
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:24,670
you know the typical the mic but that is
what you talkin to an arson serrano's

407
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:29,000
bankrupted talking to pewter the and
always my mind at my

408
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,250
marketing folks are doing awesome a3
o'clock in the morning

409
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:35,240
is so those are the type of thing for
you can actually do you can do a little

410
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,710
you know I'm gonna go into the technical
stuff

411
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,750
this actually bring my only talk that is

412
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:44,010
not technical while this pretty well
drink

413
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:48,570
so you can do all the free stuff like

414
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,760
the you know the other for PC for
example right

415
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,840
to another wrote a blog we're going to
move those techniques

416
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,600
you know in there the other thing is
that %uh people

417
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,850
tried to like everybody wants to collect
everything

418
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:05,360
oh my god you know we have to collect
every single thing from the NS from the

419
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,130
PLO

420
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:10,020
Iowa ABS logged the syslog

421
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:14,270
everything right but nobody either has
the talent

422
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:18,460
the time or the tools necessary to be
able to do it right so now we're

423
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,510
thinking about all we know this is big
data crises

424
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:25,460
right how can I actually har the correct
people they designed this

425
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:29,200
mathematicians to be able to help solve
this problem well have some

426
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,480
really bad news for you for the
technical so

427
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,090
it works young if you can you know

428
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:39,419
what for the insider

429
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:43,710
you gonna play big they don't mean yeah
you can probably see how many times you

430
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,820
know this guy

431
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,929
published today that isn't Carolina on
and Twitter

432
00:25:48,929 --> 00:25:52,410
about is that but a

433
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:56,710
you know that that's the type of things
that I is is pretty awesome

434
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:00,440
it indians so what you can do is
actually outsource

435
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,929
right

436
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:08,090
anyways in all seriousness you know
there's some mitigation some

437
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:11,950
this practice and the word mitigation

438
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:15,010
one is a really good resource this is
actually you know

439
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:18,980
probably one of the best resources there
is a serial would certainly actually

440
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:19,530
have a

441
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:23,290
few things out there bottom one

442
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:27,130
the again this is like the when mister
from the flow

443
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:30,480
hungover took some other things always
been corporate thriller in this program

444
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,550
you know it is unknown the beginning
with the hiring process

445
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:38,220
monitoring response to this no
disruptive things that are happening in

446
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,540
your organization

447
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:43,140
and this is actually not something that
a let's get the nurse took to figure it

448
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:43,720
out

449
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,660
right so if you're involved now with
this insider threat

450
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:52,210
this is beyond unearthing right so you
have to look into your processes

451
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:56,520
and two also not only that hiring but
also whenever you fire people

452
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,919
how effective is your organization to
cart axes

453
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,940
to in some cases have been organizations
the

454
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,350
were you know if you get higher even by

455
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:09,600
you'll get fire you get higher by the
contractor the literally

456
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,179
you know what you owe them you
government but your computer anymore

457
00:27:13,179 --> 00:27:16,620
is it too late you never know right
those level

458
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:21,130
behaviors you know you have to keep keep
track in the number of course anticipate

459
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,200
and manage those

460
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,810
to no of course your ass is the one to
protect implement

461
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:30,850
of course this is typical the strict
passwords and account management

462
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:34,350
separation of duties right used to work
for the government

463
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:38,540
not permanently but is to work for the
government for the only

464
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,640
and that such as something that they
didn't really good that

465
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,160
a lot of corporations don't do but great
and

466
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,330
some corporations like to do with some
fund busting that even the government

467
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:52,230
you know doesn't do that well but but I
see across as very

468
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:55,530
inconsistent right that separation of
duties

469
00:27:55,530 --> 00:28:00,179
and is really really really hard might
whenever then offers moral is that we

470
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:01,090
even so the

471
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:05,020
both collaboration collaboration
collaboration cross-pollination

472
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:09,100
you know over and the you need access to
information especially if you want to be

473
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:09,740
competitive

474
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:13,169
right in it is really hard to do but

475
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:16,390
you know you have to think about that
and then of course

476
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:20,200
the the secured agreements on on club
providers some

477
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,060
you know the monitoring capabilities
something to that the other one is to do

478
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,090
them

479
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:29,220
stream in a strange in access control of
course the

480
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:32,990
change-up controls if at three o'clock
in the morning something is such a

481
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,870
change in your firewall

482
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:38,040
by an administrator even though is that
I miss reno he doesn't have a change of

483
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,290
control or think it

484
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:43,660
to the you know leave the 31 other

485
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:47,070
the few technical things you can I
should probably do a reply great so if

486
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:47,790
you

487
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:51,330
is to do the way that only a change

488
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:55,120
can be done if there's a ticket which is
the best practices

489
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,960
and not somebody pissed about three
o'clock in the morning before he gets

490
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,090
higher

491
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:03,190
federal company that's a thats you know
that

492
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:06,720
that will be a valuable

493
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,740
then of course I'm gonna go into a a lot
of them they are mostly for your

494
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:13,840
the reference but my career you know me
too remote access

495
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,490
specially you know things that are fishy

496
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:20,490
the and ID's really hard

497
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:24,330
is actually i i no friends of mine that
actually been to connect with some BP

498
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,590
and

499
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:29,320
from another you know places with you so
you can watch the cricket game

500
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,290
it so there's not is hard to see whether
what is malicious or not but you have to

501
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:34,150
be vigilant

502
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:37,150
in you know some other behaviors the
actually see other

503
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:41,690
specially whenever you got a ramp up and
I'm not saying this

504
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:45,320
you know who was talking to your people
but you know whenever you see a rumble

505
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,370
you know I don't know is social media

506
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:53,800
the friends or something or people
following a specific person because

507
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,440
put in some you know ambulance chasing
problem there you know that the may be

508
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,940
actually something they may want to pay
attention to

509
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:06,210
him again this yr very best practices
what I want to actually do right now

510
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:10,090
is learn from you so a purposely
actually this

511
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:14,570
to somewhat over 40-minute presentation
but I want to learn

512
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:18,679
word is for those of you that raise your
hand the you're doing well

513
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:23,080
insider threat or for those who they're
not doing right now

514
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:27,800
but our more intriguing to the technical
abilities that we actually have can have

515
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,880
a single street to

516
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:35,880
combating terror threat what is there to
do

517
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:17,460
any luck

518
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:24,880
they don't

519
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:48,600
there

520
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,180
but

521
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,680
forgot

522
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,260
up you can go to from the prince

523
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:05,260
will rule anything with things that are
related to the human behavior

524
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:09,650
right like HR type perspective if you
probably no man this is

525
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:13,450
when it comes don't to it privacy to

526
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:17,600
right but it when I read you come
probably have some type of indicators

527
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,860
not of compromise but indicators are
problematic areas

528
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:24,180
like you you know some companies have it

529
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:27,810
the performance improvement plan right
so as soon as you know that I keys

530
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:28,510
happening

531
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:32,100
you know the peeps some guys gonna be
pissed off I and especially people

532
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,260
people you know what a minister and Pip
the you know you

533
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:38,360
going up is talking to some cold weather
now

534
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,220
clear that Laurel these and I didn't
share that but

535
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:45,370
when I was with somebody studies in
talking to some other guys concert

536
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:48,750
if they actually mention a lot of these

537
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,940
really bad attacked did in door not
carry on my technical people

538
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:56,990
or administrators rights of course you
know the there were several

539
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:00,480
my network administrators specially the
one from the name that has happened in

540
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:00,860
May

541
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:06,040
%um but a lot of these are not even
technical folks might

542
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,150
the and they're really really really
really good

543
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:13,190
also into the social engineering fact
you know again remember the

544
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:16,330
the known bad and the

545
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:19,350
assume good that's probably one of the
best the

546
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:22,790
now using the urinal probably Superman
or

547
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:27,030
Wonder Woman may not be us you think
that Superman Wonder Woman is

548
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:34,030
this here

549
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,970
no actually that's a really really good
point his son justin was the whole

550
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:07,029
why we we actually stopped raining and
then we

551
00:34:07,029 --> 00:34:11,859
do very tactical sending emails with
specific link that we can probably

552
00:34:11,859 --> 00:34:13,260
become behavior

553
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:20,260
so that that's a good thing the well yes
sir

554
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:58,670
even for encrypting communication

555
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:12,789
yes

556
00:35:12,789 --> 00:35:19,789
up all

557
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:26,400
the other so not the brings a insider
threat the defense is like the were

558
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,090
hacker

559
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:31,880
you know how you define what is a hacker
the yet development maybe somebody that

560
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,100
such a compromise on

561
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:37,460
issues as a stepping stone is so is that
is the only intended

562
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:40,770
you know it's not a threat for that of
course you can apply technology because

563
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:41,780
actually somebody's

564
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:45,330
owning the machine the actually you
bring an excellent point

565
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:51,200
the the evolution of things that we're
seeing us for sex with Asian other

566
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,510
the so again I'm gonna actually put my
technical had no

567
00:35:54,510 --> 00:36:00,300
and this may be relevant for you guys it
the cold food items he not there

568
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,300
in some cases pretty weak is the same
thing over and over and over

569
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:07,760
the said and other is the computer is
pretty strong on there too

570
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,610
right when a rigid bodies the initially

571
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:15,660
so what I do for Cisco is that I get all
the bad news you know the researchers

572
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,390
all the

573
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:20,570
you know customers are are getting you
know attacked and within the contact

574
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:24,300
my king be sir and then we investigate
all

575
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,730
you know anything it can be you know an
attack against the US box

576
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:31,870
an attack against the far wall attack
against the host it will enable it to

577
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,080
you in an IP phone

578
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:37,560
in maybe woman a body against you know a
cloud service that we have

579
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:42,060
anything quite so so it's pretty big I
guess the verso

580
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:45,220
things that we're seeing and is not the
same

581
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:48,650
you know in most cases but if you look
at the historical things with

582
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:52,290
and what keeps me up at night

583
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:57,010
is that a initially somebody will send
an email

584
00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:01,610
or will cause to the peace earliest same
day I have this buffer overflow

585
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,150
vulnerability in your router

586
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:07,840
Hogan who then and so you know thank you
in this okay no can you give me credit

587
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,810
to your by serene because you know

588
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:13,490
I'm building my penetration testing
company

589
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:16,490
and I want to put in my resume shoe you
know give you a credit and

590
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:19,980
by sorry thank you four Fun in the Sun
responsible disclosure

591
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:24,920
we get your pics were posted by some
other guys happy then moved into

592
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,340
hey Cisco you have a book for a flow

593
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:31,600
in your honor or anything to

594
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,509
and I want some money right so can you
give me some money

595
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:39,490
but no gonna give you some money add up
I'm is so

596
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:42,570
you know that we have so much over the
river system

597
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:45,700
that if you what you like the web's
server

598
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:49,060
like you know YouTube or something out I
can give you money because they can

599
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:49,720
control that

600
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,270
but in some cases or him products you
know things that

601
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:56,410
that are not assisi know that if I

602
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:59,660
in white happening to me like you're
bringing

603
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:03,030
but one day is so is pretty diverse
right so

604
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:06,420
that you know if it comes to the fact
that we have to protect customers

605
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:09,950
you know we do whatever it takes to
write to us our mission with some bones

606
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:13,440
are seen as not be 1 p.m. for Cisco
because we line stop product

607
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,560
the there are making making lot a lot a
lot of money

608
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,430
we stop it from actually going up but
anyways Israel

609
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:24,700
then some other folks are saying no to
give me some equipment so I can play

610
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,910
I cannot buy your twelve million dollar
rotor but I want to have access to a

611
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:28,690
serious one

612
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:31,810
okay sure have 3 so get access to the

613
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:35,340
you know from your computer when we
fixin we've posted up know with a

614
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,550
transitional

615
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:39,940
brokers right so of course brokers I
want to also

616
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:44,140
make money for women ability to improve
your signature and it is though

617
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:47,250
me getting in the mail from researcher

618
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:50,510
I got an email from a program to save
you know I have room

619
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:54,680
who's going to sleep on a wonderful your
product you have six months

620
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:58,690
and make given credit and for them to
actually pay them

621
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:02,150
but the magnification before awesome bus
hunky-dory that's awesome

622
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:06,200
i fix it I don't care about the kato
again you know from my perspective

623
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,640
what I don't disclose protected the
customer product this post so as long as

624
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,380
I have a fix

625
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:16,020
you know again apparently but then
whatever I'm seen no

626
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,760
is outside of the brokers on this is
across the company is in a border with

627
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,640
their party

628
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,910
nonprofit organization that my cousin is
there are not only their

629
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:27,190
you know a lot of people in till the
Oracle are there

630
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:30,520
and summer for this

631
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,870
during our stay conference we were in
the room we're probably

632
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:38,980
be owners the problem owners 0 more than
75 percent of the series other

633
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:42,920
right were in this room and I was
talking to them as a min where things

634
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,600
are you seeing

635
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:47,240
the other brokers are here and there but
basically the stock is the

636
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,310
the things that we don't know about
right

637
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:53,770
and their the things that we of course
see if you stop selling drugs

638
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:57,700
you select we try to make more money
than selling drugs and the

639
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:01,910
and then we found out about it until
some costume rocky goals or

640
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:05,270
whatever the case may be right with us
what is keeping us up

641
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:09,410
collectively in the world and I thought
we were a bunch of things that are

642
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:12,870
using very very basic things

643
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:16,500
with really really really hard hopeful
right

644
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,640
to a strong couple so

645
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,680
what I'm trying to go is that in that

646
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,360
typo I guess the evolution

647
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:32,220
is now being them being compliment that
if you can call

648
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:36,560
with the behavioral up somebody right
somebody that is best though

649
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:41,170
and about actors already Camp Hill if
you're looking for a job

650
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:44,930
as much like that we know already if
you're looking for a job

651
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:48,170
and the head with a study in last year
who was in that

652
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:51,710
security report is that they will from
generate to March

653
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:55,060
and them from September to November
that's one or more so the people are

654
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,580
putting stuff in like

655
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,940
in all the months to come on LinkedIn
update in the think and already know

656
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:00,500
that

657
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:04,420
and their target you like is no way in
hell if I posed

658
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:08,390
even if you don't want to be insider but
if you really really really want to pay

659
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:10,040
per minute those laws here

660
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:13,390
if I post the dream job right now

661
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:17,750
and I say I'm looking for some guy that
work at Cisco

662
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:21,000
as a bizarre incident manager starting
salaries will be four hundred thousand

663
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,920
dollars a year

664
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,310
on the you know the work from home in
everything oh my god that sounds like a

665
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:27,740
dream job right

666
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:31,540
and the you know every everybody's like
a chief of something so chief architect

667
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:31,900
of

668
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:35,450
you hackery so you apply for a job

669
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:39,190
and the first thing that they can ask it
anyway the pool for leaving the bill

670
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,750
will you do for a living is a

671
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:44,250
and they put some scenarios for you
maybe if you are interesting

672
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:48,740
they can get some the the stuff from you
think is no way in hell

673
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:52,680
and then you know of course you in a
hurry but you got a lot of information

674
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,560
from there

675
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:57,130
so even that unintended insider threat

676
00:41:57,130 --> 00:42:00,840
with a call for that we're seeing in in
that's for sex with Asian and everything

677
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,130
it can be combined

678
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:06,070
and you already know what I don't have
to send somebody to whoever

679
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:09,090
and the sting of your environment a
radio interview you

680
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:12,650
you probably already gave me some
information that I then I can

681
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:16,330

682
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:19,900

683

684
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:30,400
the so it you know that's the type of
thing so we're actually seeing reno

685
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:40,020
they want to frustrate you user

686
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:57,500
