1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,040
or okay so

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:09,919
that was a lot of nonsense but I yes so
basically a room I slide deck and bass

3
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:13,809
with another it's in eyeball

4
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:16,900
it's all menu-driven bash though

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,730
all just because we're clear a make it
bigger

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,940
I also meant some for you guys like it
right

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,940
that is thing sir the better

8
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:33,179
alright so prerequisite is really
important parts the talk

9
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:37,030
then we get to the other stuff the you
drink protocol

10
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:42,929
is a thing that we do I am yeah

11
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:46,269
nice and cozy thanks guys

12
00:00:46,269 --> 00:00:49,609
I didn't think about like presentation
stuff

13
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:54,780
so

14
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,219
you drink is a arm a thing

15
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,870
where is this Leah M adaptation to the
small stuff

16
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,270
where essentially the

17
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,360
speaker declares that I'll

18
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,520
the drink is the you drink is a thing
that's happening

19
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,670
prepares the drink and then decides

20
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,390
ran will hand it out so our drink
tonight is actually something I've

21
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:20,630
called liver bleed

22
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:24,890
I am and I it's

23
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,550
it's basically Sailor Jerry and signer

24
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:33,260
I I was values which are by angry
orchard a little bit sweeter

25
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:37,380
and sit with the quantities around
that's gonna be in this is probably nice

26
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,520
to have that so will um will get started
with this I have

27
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,940
help with distributing these when they
come out

28
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,040
I'll but it's basically a one to one
sort of

29
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,050
not even really a cocktail it's just a

30
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,290
let's Sapporo this summer and a pitcher
and

31
00:01:54,290 --> 00:02:01,290
see how it goes so

32
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,600
sir

33
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,700
this is how this goes

34
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:15,700
has often talk more times has more
entertaining than my computer number I'm

35
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,870
mood

36
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,730
we got plenty by be fine

37
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,239
so basically the

38
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:32,239
the rules if you drink or if I do I have
to take a drink

39
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,470
if you ask a good question or point out
goof

40
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:38,940
you get a drink I by the side you drink

41
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,190
then you get a drink it's basically an
excuse to drink

42
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:47,250
has put together by deviant along up his
own fame

43
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,670
deviance a great guy lotta love for
deviant war

44
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,769
guys pyramid you us and

45
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:58,400
DSD here this year haven't seen him at a
wedding

46
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,920
as I was like to give deviant a drink
for bring this glorious thing to our

47
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,239
knowledge but yeah I mean this is it

48
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,370
sweets gonna BR from the distributor

49
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,940
and I if you need more

50
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:18,239
things they're they're I can put a lid
on Korea little

51
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,620
were nicely and there we go so

52
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:28,620
that's that yeah I need actually agree
to cut my and open tomorrow

53
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:33,690
good I who am I i

54
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,739
I am with that didn't work so I ask you
are solely fail an hour I'm with I would

55
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:41,040
fail its the fail Association the blocks
were induces

56
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,180
thank you Federation I'll

57
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,170
not bad actually

58
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:52,090
never had them before

59
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,670
really not bad to drink again for not
having

60
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,050
go before an I break into things on the
pantry investor

61
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:04,239
adversarial engineer or you call those
things days

62
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,049
so we're going to talk about

63
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:12,200
password cracking this talk is titled
password cracking for noobs

64
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,040
I the or the other oil you can forget
about this so are we

65
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,500
you know fail we didn't put a lock code
our very big into the free and open

66
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,790
information sharing but

67
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:24,389
its it only to an extent if you are
Dennis kunz

68
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:29,220
you're not allowed to look at this of or
use a dennis is even here I just need to

69
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,870
make sure he this goes on the record

70
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,910
he is aware that this is not allowed to

71
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,889
deal with any of this you're not allowed
to talk to us about this it's the rule

72
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:41,260
so that's just kinda it

73
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,990
yes this kunz

74
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:51,150
is arm Dennis I mean it's Dennis

75
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,220
I mean if you that's okay

76
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,830
did like nobody in here knows a dennis
is that okay it

77
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:02,470
his behavior the rotor go estimates from
ballantine

78
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:07,030
so nearby I'm sorry from near Ballantyne

79
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:11,150
know we love Dennis arm dennis is
actually pretty influential and and fail

80
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:11,670
having

81
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:15,660
some someone serve organization because
the invite us to the conference

82
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,420
and that apparently miss people excited

83
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,880
so we're talking about hasher's we're
not gonna talk about Dennis cuz that's

84
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,570
against the rules we always play by the
rules

85
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,480
so we're gonna get through a couple
things are a little houses are what they

86
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,120
look like

87
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,390
why did this and bash my task is not
gonna work there either I'm sure

88
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,800
basically a password hashes the result
of a cryptographic function

89
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,960
take an arbitrary string updated returns
a fixed size strength you take this

90
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,620
little bit

91
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,810
run at the crib though Michael talk
about all the kind the group that this

92
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:45,800
is for noobs

93
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:51,110
I and then you get a fixed-length result
various different types

94
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:55,270
archive though algorithms output
different varieties

95
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,540
up by the the actual end result but

96
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:02,860
you know what we end up with is you take
password one

97
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,140
run at the indy five and you get this
book here at the top

98
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,930
shy 18 you get that until embers in a
password one is this

99
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,510
so password one pass for one pass for
one that's the same

100
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:19,110
plain text value difficult to schemes
same link so even if you put password to

101
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:23,130
or password 22 and in the these they
would still if it's only five come up

102
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:27,000
the same like this password one saber
saw one severin tell em

103
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,450
now why did this and bash

104
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:34,270
was for the lolzz I'm glad that worked
at like you to believe

105
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:38,920
ask you that gonna work so there there
are a couple other aspects to getting

106
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,580
hasher's

107
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:43,470
one you let other people get I mean by
all means that's that's perfectly viable

108
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,240
I will talk about methods are doing that
don't want is a great place to

109
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,290
%uh the Twitter account awesome
forgetting password ups

110
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,750
I there's a nice blog post that door and
put together

111
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:00,450
I'll on his Twitter bot that he wrote on
his coat open source

112
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:04,190
so you can downloader on yourself modify
add red X whatever

113
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,570
I an example love this you know you just
look at the Twitter feed

114
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:11,240
and it gives you a link tells you what
did trigger on and this one is just

115
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,410
emails but of time to find loads and
loads ashes

116
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:18,880
I'm so it's a really great place to to
find a hash and try to work on

117
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,550
you know cracking and want to get that
the way is for you to go get 'em

118
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:26,330
now how can see who might be really for
us not real

119
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,340
I sequel matt has a nice

120
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,680
Google feature well Google's pretty good
about blocking this now but the whole

121
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,960
point single night who lurks just
autonomy

122
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,230
stealing and dumping things leaving the
password hashes are tables

123
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,970
a good amount I'm you have a compromise
system that sport has some amazing

124
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:43,940
models

125
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,700
as in be exact is wonderful the
prototype on that

126
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,150
or even polling hasher's combined
shuttle services so you wanna see your

127
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,170
own domain controller

128
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:55,390
I say this way to get asses off coming
trawlers porn

129
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:58,800
from by Jul network access your just
poured in

130
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,490
a ploy the spider lab guys warrant does
great work on responder

131
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:07,220
that's on the buyer's name service
lookup poisoning tall does a great job

132
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,680
capturing hasher's he's been working on
the S&P real a portion of that as well

133
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,440
were mostly interested in capturing
hashes for the sake of cracking them

134
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,730
a mess we also has an SMB listeners and
really

135
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:23,210
some contrasting to the ways I I use
modestly to grab passes that still work

136
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:27,310
they shouldn't work any more but they
still do on unifier the Metasploit

137
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,330
I SMB listener without auxiliary

138
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:35,110
and either through Internet Explorer you
can create an image tag which is great

139
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,110
the UNC path

140
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:40,320
image tag in Internet Explorer elicits
block somewhere between

141
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,450
client an endpoint I if you connect if
you pointed at your mess with handler

142
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,630
it will issue a challenge and the host
for the fight the machine wash elites

143
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,500
and its credits

144
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,050
in in Astana those in the net not in
till and password cracker

145
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,120
unique password hash is a great way to
get those

146
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,990
I'll another method is to use a word
document resume doc .doc

147
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,140
my some funds an HR I same thing

148
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,190
with that word UNC injector you pointed
to where your mess wit and our allies

149
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,700
and and then grab that cash that way I

150
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,770
all these are are useful in obtaining
the hasher's

151
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:18,620
that's kinda one of those things and
come out my pushin

152
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,830
and developing this talk is at this
point we are you most of our past

153
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,510
requirements and organizations

154
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:28,540
are a characters minimum reporting by
its characters

155
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:32,000
and I want that to go away II don't

156
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,960
I don't have really good solutions on
how to train users to make that better

157
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,650
by I'll me I xkcd comic for everything

158
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:43,560
very the correct word battery stable
doesn't mean anybody's complexity

159
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,430
requirements

160
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:49,550
was a much better password then you know
Molly 1984

161
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:53,120
like I'll because if you give me a
password with regard to the complexity

162
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,710
of Italy a character's

163
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:59,370
iconic I can use my friend year and try
to crack it like 2.4 billion the tempers

164
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,210
I

165
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,570
the acres is gonna fall if I'm just
brute forcing is we're gonna see if I

166
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,600
can get towards the demo aspect to this

167
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,080
I'm 12 show a little bit more the
mindset beyond

168
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,810
just blind reinforcing be way quicker
than that

169
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:16,340
wat kinda talk about getting there so I
was doing hasher's

170
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:20,200
I love cracking them and I think if you
get a hash most the time

171
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,570
you should then on that account because
yeah that

172
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:30,410
so what do you do with them alright to
get many German battered

173
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,440
price point you need to know it kinda

174
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,460
hash it is you can manually identify
these by looking the character sets

175
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,480
and certain link that will boreal that
yearly relook at Wikipedia not

176
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,530
I me and defies for you to get away
basic support set up there are some

177
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:45,860
great

178
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,290
automated methods that's the exact hash
tag script

179
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:53,140
is great in that it will identify
multiple types of crashes and then I'll

180
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,230
put them to a file

181
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:57,690
and with the various amounts and their
on hash identifiers

182
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:01,130
is a Python script that also pretty good
at taking the same manual

183
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:04,210
characteristics you would use with this
gonna miss them

184
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:08,100
on the verge on the river's really good
about identify a password house if you

185
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,610
have a hashing are really sure exactly
what kind it is

186
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:14,440
if you just run a quick instanceof John
which also the other

187
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,210
and then but the ass in there it'll give
you its gases

188
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,560
as to what it thinks it is and it's
usually really accurate so began to go

189
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,460
with rashes are

190
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:27,310
that you're not you know lost all

191
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:30,020
go

192
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,380
will you do with them the crackle

193
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,770
my favorite type of crypto its rubber
hose cryptanalysis

194
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:40,700
three ty somebody will chair be to
Mother Earth

195
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,800
until they give you the password have a
computer

196
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,080
you use a computer for that because
we're gonna be non-violent I

197
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,430
GB you processor 2gb graphics processing
units

198
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:54,580
are are really awesome in the regard

199
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,970
love perilous parallelization of
operations

200
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:02,250
which makes them really flexible in
writing applications that can

201
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:07,840
use that functionality to do password
cracking an insanely fast speeds

202
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,270
it so fast like the whole rainbow table
fad should be dead

203
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:15,070
because I'm a table are feasible you can
carry around that much with you

204
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:19,210
maybe you can store somewhere will talk
about up

205
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:22,490
a suite of tools that the music's is
developed that that can

206
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,720
if you have somewhere hosted elsewhere
that you can actually maintain that

207
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,810
another day but we're talking terabyte
terabytes

208
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:31,400
data that I mean the dais its cool

209
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,020
really neat thing I but like the time
memory tree of thing in my mind like

210
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,350
if you're on a task if you're or if you
want to do something was urs

211
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:43,050
I'll time is of the essence your ability
to be portable

212
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:46,360
is very important so for me it's more
the ability to adapt to any given

213
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,240
scenario

214
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,910
maintain you know provide bring the
table so you have all the character

215
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,240
length and type senator

216
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,600
I to my big is that I go to for for
cracking

217
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,110
I'll use of crack very much but John the
Ripper

218
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:03,520
is my go to for quick and agents if I
have a hash

219
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,570
the end my linux machine or whatever

220
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:10,520
for one does whatever a matter and ASCAP
as your ass gets the the Jeep you

221
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,410
specific one John's working on John the
Ripper is working on it I mean this is

222
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,750
Mike my shot out soviet White Chapel is
amazing front and

223
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:24,160
for automating and agent Ising if you
will your your password cracking

224
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,370
you to set up in the nudist upload word
lists or hash lists

225
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,620
and whatever it distribute up the
workload using Redis and

226
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,950
it's great I highly recommend you gonna
take a look at that at least get setting

227
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:35,710
up and running

228
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:39,130
he's done some work on past six months
or so to stir up the

229
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:43,220
the repository in the last 1i use pretty
heavily assist this

230
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,520
zip file to buy I know everybody's gonna
be a sin to download that's fine

231
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,060
honest I know i know i like it wins if
it is

232
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,290
its use so basically mat nai and Adam

233
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,390
I value two years ago

234
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,820
only maintain a list years now I

235
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:04,100
mag gotta get cracking rate and we all
had a nice manic swing on

236
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,440
collecting all the leaked passwords we
could

237
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,330
clear this idea K we know a lot about
how people make passwords

238
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:15,740
we know that usually the capital first
letter with the word wasn't digits for

239
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,260
some characters or whatever

240
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,260
so let's get as many of those as we can
and maintain that as a word list

241
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:25,810
call it started out pretty well well
when we started doing line gave him into

242
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:26,650
cracking more

243
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:30,660
getting more in use passwords and I
don't have the final count but

244
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,990
on me I I still update this list about
once a month and push anyone up to the

245
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,040
bill site but honestly

246
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,360
I its head on over better more efficient
word with their bigger ones

247
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,260
switches I am

248
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,820
but as far as like as as far as

249
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:54,410
the capabilities a a base words and bass
configurations and then what you can do

250
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,890
with berries were mingling rules

251
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:59,320
and the applications I'm a big fan of
that while

252
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,440
I maintain it so clearly I'm a little
bit biased but you're welcome to

253
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,130
download that or not and then use that
crack passwords

254
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:10,780
going through things pretty quickly in a
lotta

255
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:15,610
Avalon pitchers are many questions yes 7

256
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:22,610
yes this man is a drink yessir

257
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,870
yet debtor gets a

258
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:32,610
negative impact on trees which and
obviously we have enough but yep

259
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:36,350
that's fine not fun everybody else will
drink for you it's perfectly fine

260
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,830
I do you do with all the houses in the
same way if you have the salt

261
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:42,890
then you just throw that in with your
with your syntax

262
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:46,460
cracking you don't have the salt well
usually the salt in the same table

263
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:50,460
also my favorite things about the
Federal Reserve leak arm

264
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:54,100
not this past February ever before I
when the

265
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,150
the Fed line notification system got pop
and

266
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:02,900
it was like all the login information
personal contact information for all

267
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,110
these small banks

268
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:07,540
I'll and they have hit in this

269
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:11,160
all the same table at the indy five hash
and thus all

270
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,680
was right next to each other make call

271
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,120
banks so you have questions you want
alcohol

272
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:25,120
yes all-star the question I don't so
expensive yahoo has great if you think

273
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,370
they're here

274
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:31,770
the link that may cause with the all the
Google because the two words meant

275
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:32,420
Thursday

276
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:37,330
take diced is employed in yeah it is
actually surprisingly affect the

277
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,630
anything about that some that's always
fun did you can also search

278
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:44,710
arm I get home in places for Ashes I
don't think about that you'd like

279
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:47,800
it's great the search rashes and get
help because people

280
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:53,880
uploader then they're gone forever
rivers yes usually cracking

281
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,070
yeah what I like to do in a pen testing
this is this is a

282
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:00,540
nice trick I've I learned in Lawnside
rhineland

283
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:05,370
I running responder getting in net NTLM
hash

284
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:08,410
cracking that and logging into a machine

285
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:11,640
using SMB exact I can be done with

286
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,780
a a as far as the exploitation aspect
the report post exploitation which is

287
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,329
where the real

288
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:20,930
mean burns's course but the initial
exploitation once you have a grammy

289
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,390
don't like 30 minutes

290
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:26,949
and you have two main admin that point
are I think so on

291
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:31,510
and he's a fuckin getting

292
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,810
getting 10 Alan 10

293
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:38,770
yet I'm be in I'm being lied to me my
best time from fish to the mainland as

294
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:39,850
four minutes though

295
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:44,250
don't kasher domain admin creds on
Billboard station

296
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,410
yes 7 up

297
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:52,380
that's funny

298
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,260
yet take care 7 yep

299
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,410
this

300
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:02,530
I'll actually a walking the Dolomite my
shell script just the

301
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:09,110
I II me this is my documentation

302
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:14,070
I I mean this is me that you can you can
find tutorials on password cracking

303
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:17,900
I'm not presenting anything anybody else
has already done I don't think I'm

304
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,100
giving you any groundbreaking novel stop
I but

305
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,620
I find that sometimes it's difficult to
find all this in one chunk of

306
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:28,020
got a hash what a crack it was our
concept around it so

307
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,130
I live in written anything about it I
prefer to talk

308
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:34,700
and not have the right cuz I'll

309
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:40,460
so you crack on we are to do that right
I believe that his backup

310
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:47,460
what's up earlier questions yes I'm
sorry

311
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:53,679
I I don't now I can't think of anything

312
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:59,429
okay

313
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:02,519
yeah be interesting to work without not
are not done anything with that

314
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:07,039
generally don't run into that the vast
majority I hit for web even web stuff

315
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,029
has been the five

316
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:12,309
which isn't an iclicker and then for
Windows environment so until I am

317
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:19,029
or not until yessir

318
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:26,029
yeah they're better than India they get
one

319
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:41,590
yep know they do get hot I'll it's a
good way to feature

320
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:47,200
your house in the winner password
cracking yep

321
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,620
yeah yet that's a good thing you my from
your hardware no

322
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:54,740
perspective I yeah you can running a
card like that

323
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,309
and the ground they don't always run for
huge extended period of time sometimes

324
00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:00,720
they do but you know you under furniture
stuff that's cool

325
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:07,720
has barely computers don't agree when
they get hot that's just prime

326
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,929
yeah

327
00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:22,780
yep yet John 0 MP is more the is that
this at the the fork about thats

328
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:28,710
still doing up for their new one aka

329
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:32,080
cuz I use John desko NP

330
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,080
was handles a multiprocessor stuff but I
haven't looked at the new authorize an

331
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,559
issue stay on the leading edge aspect
get hard on skype a lot a new features

332
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,059
that they're at it any to ask add just a
huge re

333
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:44,080
revamp up stop gonna go to stay on
yessir

334
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:51,080
yeah

335
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,650
but the Amazon Amazon all-party file

336
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:59,720
3 that's yours

337
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:05,429
yeah the question was I am the questions
related to canal

338
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:09,330
me how to strip you can you get with
this I am White Chapel is actually

339
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,340
probably the best

340
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,440
distribution interface i've seen 4 I

341
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,669
Amazon you can do with Amazon you know
the typical not be resorted complaint as

342
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:18,540
the Invidia

343
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:22,390
so it's not it's like fundamentally not
gonna be as fast as MD but ill do

344
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:26,340
yeah yeah

345
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,559
there's I'm trying to say I didn't I
think even in these notes I am

346
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:33,549
there is a guy that has a pretty good
tutorial on building out that type army

347
00:21:33,549 --> 00:21:40,549
with Amazon you can find it pretty
quickly with the Google search yeah

348
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:43,959
right

349
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:46,919
yeah you gotta be careful on that don't
they aloe they are

350
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:50,859
they will they'll believe very quickly
but yeah I mean by all means army

351
00:21:50,859 --> 00:21:57,859
not careful remotely over about care

352
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:09,730
cool

353
00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:17,149
yeah earner free art so mu has been a
grand and by

354
00:22:17,149 --> 00:22:20,779
an amazing cracking Rick install Windows
on who cares

355
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:24,359
whatever is out on I'll

356
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:29,200
or I recall so

357
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,979
this is the time that would tempt the
demigods a script that suits on that

358
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:35,489
story

359
00:22:35,489 --> 00:22:41,419
so what we gonna do well this is going
to be the commander I've got a fresh

360
00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:45,509
don't both instilling hashes directly
from an Active Directory

361
00:22:45,509 --> 00:22:49,580
and we're gonna run John gonna tell it
to a middle line in standard alan has

362
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,129
cracked

363
00:22:50,129 --> 00:22:53,460
we're gonna tell you to use is the false
other were mingling rules

364
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:58,389
so it's gotta oldham what were the roads
are a the format is the format a hash

365
00:22:58,389 --> 00:23:01,950
newsdesk the though the wirless I'm
gonna be using

366
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:05,299
and that is the at the the text file

367
00:23:05,299 --> 00:23:08,590
ashes that i'm gonna be running on so
this isn't this isn't

368
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:11,609
difficult at all especially would have
kept

369
00:23:11,609 --> 00:23:16,099
and I don't have to ask an example
though much I never ask Akanbi I am

370
00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:19,200
obtuse when it comes to mailing syntax
down

371
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,429
i John the rivers much more friendly in
that regard

372
00:23:22,429 --> 00:23:26,070
Tom if you have some serious cracking to
do I ask at

373
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:29,830
the best place to go for that is because
you stop John's getting there

374
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:33,309
but I mean honestly most my time I am

375
00:23:33,309 --> 00:23:36,519
because I don't like your own dust-up
with me is is done and John

376
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:40,190
because I've the the effectiveness of
this word list and we'll talk kinda a

377
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,509
theory on that again is

378
00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:45,509
we know how people use passwords so if
we can maintain password lists that are

379
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:46,729
a lot alike

380
00:23:46,729 --> 00:23:50,669
how people actually make their passwords
we have our asses we

381
00:23:50,669 --> 00:23:54,619
basically other password entirely too
many CEOs a password one

382
00:23:54,619 --> 00:24:01,619
as a cat with a gal yes

383
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,390
I have not worked on Customize rule sets
there are some really good ones out

384
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,040
there

385
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:13,120
I like actually the set rules that come
with

386
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,650
ask at some really good roles such as
well I

387
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:22,190
and they do all kinds of fun stuff ice
shot they do all kinds of fun stuff with

388
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:25,490
with the mingling and substitutions and
that sort of thing and there's also the

389
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:29,720
the added feature all Markov chains
which is a statistical approach

390
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,000
for human guessing or and telling
guessing in that

391
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,580
that speeds it up as well I you can I
mean you can tell John Does to use like

392
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,330
John dash

393
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:42,020
II and is given a list ashes and it will
brute force

394
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:45,620
what it will do it based on Markov
chains so that it's not just guessing

395
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:49,110
AAA BBB et cetera it's nice and my sins

396
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:56,059
nice and intelligent about yessir

397
00:24:56,059 --> 00:25:00,289
I don't because I work in america I

398
00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:04,260
now support new say yes

399
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:11,260
yeah

400
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:14,909
right yep

401
00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:18,450
yeah I on the other America no i i do
have a

402
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:21,510
I do a lot of work out west and national
level of a pretty

403
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:26,720
largest Hispanic base I so means the
same kinda concept you kinda gotta dig

404
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,340
into

405
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:31,409
the mindset that I mean I i think that
growing up in america

406
00:25:31,409 --> 00:25:34,780
I'll and understanding this the culture
that we build its

407
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:38,650
any I think you have to apply that same
mindset to your wordless creation or

408
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:39,640
wordless gathering

409
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,289
so I mean a place to start for me find a
pop Korean blog

410
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:48,150
and that's got a leaked password listen

411
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:51,270
start there so are you kinda

412
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:54,360
you get an idea that's that's really the
whole concept is dole

413
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:58,710
the back to the xkcd thing we've we've
spent 20 years teaching people how to

414
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:01,870
make passwords it's hard for them to
remember really easy for computers to

415
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:02,409
guess

416
00:26:02,409 --> 00:26:06,480
I and a lot of that has to do with

417
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,049
even more so now because we know how
people make the password the rock you

418
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:14,070
password was leak and running stats on
that and learning about that was

419
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:17,570
was in my mind as far as mainstream

420
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:20,830
password assessment goes
pre-revolutionary I

421
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:24,150
because its dumb to just try a

422
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:29,120
a bbbbbb ABC Hector you can be way
smarter about it much more effective

423
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,570
and that's kinda what we're gonna do so
let's tempt the gods

424
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:36,120
I gave you the script and Arron it's in
here promise

425
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,770
let's see what it does hubbell

426
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:47,770
was click nice

427
00:26:48,289 --> 00:26:55,289
well we're gonna do it man

428
00:27:04,429 --> 00:27:07,779
so there are tools and and

429
00:27:07,779 --> 00:27:11,190
I rhythms for last pass and key pass and
that sort of thing

430
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:17,110
where I you can crack that password the
master passwords can be cracked

431
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:21,120
so it it cuts down on it in that

432
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,470
I you your passwords stored you can
generally have better passwords

433
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:30,940
so if I have somebody that's using a
password generator somewhere

434
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:34,700
when I first them other son them a fake
login for make

435
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,779
give it to me because is in the users
say please log in using your going said

436
00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:41,720
your new HR Finance portal is ready
please log in using your just

437
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,409
incremental

438
00:27:42,409 --> 00:27:45,419
a lot of times we will do all of you are
aware that make

439
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:48,539
since the mine email I double A side

440
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:52,320
you ever like go into a bank with a gun
iraq you're doing it wrong

441
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,500
to send them an email

442
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,830
for I know story about a

443
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:03,630
financial institution who actually got
an email from one other customers that

444
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:04,169
please

445
00:28:04,169 --> 00:28:07,669
San this amount of money to this account
other a senate

446
00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:10,960
this on email turn up

447
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,270
dudes are yahoo account a gun pop the
navy's ship

448
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:18,520
again later ago people's up

449
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,450
that's not post anything like pictures
both be better than that I'll

450
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:29,450
but

451
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:45,080
get or

452
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:49,220
just not

453
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:56,220
iris or and then

454
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:00,299
on

455
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:03,200
during

456
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,470
there we go how so we're printing

457
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:10,910
were printing these as they're cracking
user passwords

458
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:14,750
right all fully compliant by any sort of
compliance standard I've run into you

459
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,450
thank you

460
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:21,990
I begin their

461
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:25,640
its 1 points its 1.7 percent Don

462
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,470
and we've already cracked 416 IOM

463
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:32,610
which is kinda nice but look i mean
these are this is me wanna bang

464
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:35,690
vacationed out on Walker 123 bang
welcome one

465
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:39,410
I'll like this or how people make their
passwords

466
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:43,370
dead serious israel's is out at Active
Directory fresh

467
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:47,910
fresh from Press what's also follow this
is it has the histories on it

468
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:52,160
that's always fun to crack too and you
can see here with socks

469
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,900
notice how they change their password or
didn't

470
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,950
I am X clam town

471
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:03,580
dollar sign at I had 11 my favorites I
crackers

472
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:07,780
a1 and secure care and I the history on
that

473
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:12,860
and the one before that was one and
secure percent and then dollar sign in

474
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,370
town

475
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:20,370
at there is moving their way up the
number yessir I

476
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,420
right yes you can actually pass these
asses

477
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:29,570
for both you don't have to correct these
you get 'em I

478
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:32,570
yet these are these are out are Active
Directory

479
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:37,270
around I news has actually really good
blog posts on ran for 62 on how to live

480
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,370
safely poll

481
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:41,400
and parse I am in TV ninety

482
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,510
the not that sup NTDs bring

483
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:47,570
and salmon systems up the checkpoint at
al

484
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:51,600
gonna get the idea um

485
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,530
what we're working up here is on that
list order

486
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:59,120
yeah

487
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:03,860
about it the

488
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:07,140
so are all comments

489
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,340
is is pretty nice and that we have ash

490
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:13,690
and the password and they're all in
there

491
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:16,850
and that's kinda bit I'm using again

492
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:20,320
using John bring stuff I

493
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,040
means lots you can dig into again this
pastor Greg for news on keeping this

494
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,370
extremely simplistic I and I'm

495
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:30,730
I'm more about boots on the ground let's
get it done sort of guy so

496
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:35,210
I am yeah by all means don't run
responder on the hotel network

497
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:40,340
is against the rules

498
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:44,410
we follow the rules here that's what we
do where we recall tua will fall over

499
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:51,410
yessir

500
00:31:54,540 --> 00:32:01,180
like Active Directory policies yeah I
mean making 32 character like minimum

501
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:08,180
32 character minimum length because
lengthen uniqueness matters way more

502
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,870
than complexity

503
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:14,890
I and do the stalker for like sea level
bankers and their like

504
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:20,350
see my password in there in like a
properly

505
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:27,350
yes

506
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,610
I think doing password on this is a
great idea

507
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:38,070
I think by all means you should dump
your Active Directory and check your

508
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,860
password strength in it but I mean
there's

509
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:43,110
other things I have to go and play Spurs
the mean you I

510
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:46,550
mean this is solely about you're getting
the ashes and cracking them

511
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:50,790
I you know once those houses are cracked
an able to use or in this case just you

512
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:51,660
have the ashes

513
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:55,010
I'm there are a lot of other things that
come into play for defending me if you

514
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:57,080
get these hashes you'll have to crack on

515
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,120
so in the sense of me there are some so
windows

516
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,390
the latest Windows patch did actually
shut down some

517
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:07,210
up the pass the hat functionality but it
has more to do with the administrative

518
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:08,780
accounts and local accounts

519
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:13,120
their network accounts I so they didn't
really fix it

520
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,390
S&P relay is still a problem does not
something

521
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:19,580
so they fix that back in 89 as

522
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,810
on a and essentially SMB really a tax

523
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:27,140
in the past you could capture ash and
the dish replay back to that post

524
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:30,550
and gain access they fix that

525
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:35,040
but what they didn't prevent was you
taking that passion passing it on to

526
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,280
another machine

527
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,380
and then loading it with that without
ever having a crack so

528
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:43,820
this me there's a whole other spear all
machine compromise

529
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:48,130
but I I'll really love I really love
printing these out and going to my

530
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:52,140
last day contest findings meeting and as
in Ikea

531
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:56,430
so there's here's how great your
passwords are and when you see on

532
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:59,460
you start to realize yeah I mean our
password policy

533
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:03,320
we we've never gotten a knock for
Minnesota compliance and let's be honest

534
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,900
compliance requirements drive security
motivation

535
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,450
in most organizations so if they're not
seein

536
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:12,930
any sort of near the boards not
complaining about their compliance

537
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:16,420
reports or the compliance reviews
because they meet password policy

538
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:19,790
yeah I'm I'm I want to change that I
don't want that

539
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:26,790
you think

540
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:30,920
pack that be funny issue just like

541
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,730
hope somebody panics

542
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:40,760
to right did you decide in India
immediately like the next day

543
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:46,990
are a penis that too doesn't cut it up

544
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:53,990
bad it's bad practice so

545
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:03,000
so yeah I mean it's I mean it's
basically a concept is hashers earthing

546
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,380
exist you should steal them

547
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:10,040
and then you should crack them like I
want to take the whole

548
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,370
in eighty approach it like do illegal
things but

549
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:17,250
make people like Bill use this really
who cares you're

550
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:21,990
in the pool you caught a problem so care

551
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:28,990
Aguero yousef yessir

552
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:39,799
that our city a bad really badly
universe Dom anyway

553
00:35:39,799 --> 00:35:43,000
had a good talk last year about help
Aires Don

554
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,579
yes and no

555
00:35:46,579 --> 00:35:49,710
that's that's we're talking like system
take over at that point with

556
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:53,410
now where and you know if you want the
hassle so it is another interesting

557
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:54,049
thing to

558
00:35:54,049 --> 00:35:57,710
like related trial I think unrelated
that I leave

559
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:02,430
I for my external handler I CaL I leave
'em up for a while after all do a fish

560
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:06,490
just because I mean sometimes I get
shells month later from inordinately

561
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:09,839
what did you just now run things
download

562
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:14,430
I don't know why but I was in there one
day propping up for a fish to go out

563
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:17,849
and suddenly a 132 hashes

564
00:36:17,849 --> 00:36:21,390
mile hamler Kylie

565
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:24,970
and immediately after that

566
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:28,549
I saw from the same source address
administrator final

567
00:36:28,549 --> 00:36:32,190
login that the Minister ash again so is
like a what's ahead

568
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,260
a ton of passes and then I got I

569
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:39,190
the administrator so

570
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:43,089
asserting into it and the the source IP
was actually from an auto dealership

571
00:36:43,089 --> 00:36:46,619
California I'll probably call them like

572
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:49,759
I don't know what has happened but on
stuff just hit me

573
00:36:49,759 --> 00:36:55,269
and bowl I don't talk about it but
discarding around on it my best

574
00:36:55,269 --> 00:36:58,279
theory on this hypothesis pardon me is

575
00:36:58,279 --> 00:37:01,859
precisely as much as possible bring for
use in theory wrong

576
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:08,859
grammys that the remodeling additional
believe in that my hypothesis

577
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:14,509
that environment got compromised most
likely all the ashes were obtained

578
00:37:14,509 --> 00:37:17,539
and they threw whoever they is from the
russian course

579
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:21,210
russians

580
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:26,609
I my guess is they had a list of other
hoes they want the time the log into and

581
00:37:26,609 --> 00:37:28,150
somehow fat finger my handler

582
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:32,670
and and then when they saw all those
successful login to that post

583
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:36,220
they followed up with the new little
Minister now and whatever

584
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:40,480
all never be seen again I it's really
really interesting how you can do that

585
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,539
your residential ISP's probably won't

586
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:46,809
I won't allow you to do this but if you
have GPS somewhere

587
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:50,130
another fun way to do this is just to
set up the responder handler

588
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:53,380
on that are you to you don't have to
install or one that is fully scott is a

589
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:53,769
big

590
00:37:53,769 --> 00:37:57,069
I but you can actually run responder
just leave it all

591
00:37:57,069 --> 00:38:01,789
and I you get hashes from everywhere you
get it from Lloyd PC

592
00:38:01,789 --> 00:38:05,539
in roanoke virginia I have no idea why I
get these

593
00:38:05,539 --> 00:38:12,539
it's like it's like I've upon honey pot
a funny bot thanks

594
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:18,200
I'm a dad now I have to make bad jokes
I'm hungry

595
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,660
i hunger and Jonathan so

596
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:25,849
that's basically it passes our thing you
should still asses

597
00:38:25,849 --> 00:38:29,039
use a crack houses you can do these
things to do it

598
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:33,259
and that's the end of my presentation so
this is not nearly as polished as a

599
00:38:33,259 --> 00:38:34,690
Cisco marketing video but

600
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:39,759
any more questions

601
00:38:39,759 --> 00:38:46,759
yes by all means

602
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,999
I have not run into has the right to ask
was it shouldn't happen that's kinda

603
00:39:00,999 --> 00:39:03,910
like the basic pro soccer player we know
that doesn't always work out

604
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:07,119
I've never run into that I mean it's
really talk even md5

605
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,920
at allied as possible as all the things
I love when you're only

606
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,940
on ability scanners in early this is the
week auger them runs the possibility of

607
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,319
world %uh

608
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:19,640
hash collisions yet show me that in in
the while

609
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,589
like do that I love your lab work it's
good it needs to be fixed it's not

610
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:27,359
hardly this year though think I'm sorry
that units like this

611
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:32,769
the scanners do nutty things like being
able to remember Paul like the system

612
00:39:32,769 --> 00:39:34,039
time ttyl

613
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:38,390
pains and that being like are severe
finding

614
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:42,749
and Nessus and expose why I think what
can I do with that

615
00:39:42,749 --> 00:39:46,130
I know what time it is over there cool

616
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:51,130
whole wounding got your mom to

617
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:54,740
a bit like a 13-year-old writing that up
in a report link

618
00:39:54,740 --> 00:40:01,740
like not opponents thats silly yes

619
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:16,090
yep bit at the vendor

620
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,410
Sagan yet not for the last 2 characters

621
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:28,940
all the MER those were two I run into an
organization has a written policy where

622
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:32,970
their employees at the use all number
pad codes its as one care they can

623
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:33,900
enforce that

624
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:37,940
I don't know

625
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,820
I don't know what you are you can you
can specify what characters that you

626
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:41,950
want on the use

627
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:45,190
and there are mainly rules for I

628
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:49,720
there yeah

629
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:54,030
absolutely that's not in my list yeah if
you got it yet let's say

630
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:57,440
would say it's gon you not simple
question if you're stuck to 12

631
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,070
characters

632
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:01,430
also you're stuck at a or 16 for that
matter

633
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:04,480
and you worried about your house
potentially being compromised you don't

634
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,920
want your account to be compromised the
draft compromise

635
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:10,560
yeah using really random weird
characters

636
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:15,050
granted its it slows down the process
and and you know

637
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:18,350
with the layered security model we have
this aspect the you know early detection

638
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,450
is important hopefully

639
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:22,730
in the reason we have password
expiration policies is not to annoy our

640
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,890
users it so that

641
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:29,240
we can live in a breach in the event
that is not active I what's up

642
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:34,570
no absolutely I we want to II me I'm not
saying we don't want to do that

643
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:38,130
under same Pat it Tom is our primary

644
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:42,260
goal absolutely it's a goal that was as
much missed it was possible

645
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:46,600
yeah I'll I've got some other those

646
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:50,110
I mean it yeah but not portable so
that's the idea get creative with it

647
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:53,590
I mean if you got no no llame no length
requirement

648
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:58,330
I'll all gangsta rap lyrics blockbuster
the rap

649
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:05,330
me and Ray we thought it out yes

650
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,670
yeah

651
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,690
complain

652
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:22,559
like I do I do this to Wells Fargo so
arm

653
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:25,690
I have a pretty good long I think it's
sick Wells Fargo's limited to 16

654
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:26,799
characters for

655
00:42:26,799 --> 00:42:30,030
I'll webmail or web banking I

656
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:34,250
and they don't have any sort of two
factor authentication

657
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:38,180
and I write them a strongly worded email
every month as I'd like to have all

658
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:42,339
two-factor authentication like Noel
support like its easier to break into my

659
00:42:42,339 --> 00:42:43,319
gmail

660
00:42:43,319 --> 00:42:47,619
use me might might Wells Fargo then my
gmail will you know

661
00:42:47,619 --> 00:42:50,829
you will those songs two-step up thank
you

662
00:42:50,829 --> 00:42:55,760
bring as you drink your

663
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,059
become more frequent getting better

664
00:42:59,059 --> 00:43:02,920
yeah I mean if you're limited I i mean
disc like that something that a lot of

665
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,220
my clients is there like will

666
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:08,500
you know this this is like a system
better to involve a lot like guilt the

667
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,540
vendor I don't know

668
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:12,829
like we gotta quit we gotta figure out
how to quit givin being

669
00:43:12,829 --> 00:43:19,380
being given

670
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:24,500
pick up my shirt wine

671
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,770
now I mean we have to figure out how to

672
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:31,230
how to fight that so I mean it was
another example use now I see your hand

673
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:31,480
up

674
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:34,580
you're just I is the the baby monitor
thing

675
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:40,080
we see in the news in early hackers do
not be more yeltsin is that the baby is

676
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:40,710
love you

677
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:45,660
hackers is a creeper gets on a baby
monitor

678
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:49,630
that's probably why open or using the
for credentials

679
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:54,240
and access TV has nothing to do with
hacking but the vendor pushes the stuff

680
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,240
out there knowing that

681
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:59,390
you work for vendors by all means be the
change you wish to see in the world

682
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:06,390
for thank yes ma'am yeah really long
once

683
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:12,930
yeah either to character sounds good

684
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:17,070
phrases and yeah

685
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:20,280
that's that was a good password reset

686
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,720
racket

687
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:28,440
raster I don't know you're here subdued
as Jack and Jill went up the hill after

688
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:33,140
that we all know what happened that I
thought about it

689
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:40,140
Obama this work my way through yes

690
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:48,830
girl really care that much but the truth

691
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:52,099
by I'm not lie with you pop my bank
account to use all my money

692
00:44:52,099 --> 00:44:55,780
guess what like it a lot back I don't
care but America

693
00:44:55,780 --> 00:45:01,670
know I've been because because all the
banks are doing it equally as poorly

694
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:08,670
or yet

695
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:14,599
yeah I love that up but

696
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:18,400
I don't care and I like this Google I
complain a lot and if i fix things I can

697
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,650
complain to stop

698
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:26,650
own room I fun %uh Grieser yes

699
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:38,470
I make you happier to damn it feels good
to be a gangster you just smile when you

700
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:39,410
read

701
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:42,760
yeah that's that's looking

702
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,870
that's the thing yet it so it's the user
education that's more difficult than the

703
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:46,850
policy changes

704
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:50,830
and that's in that like get back to
again xkcd I cartoon for everything we

705
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:53,380
have spent 20 is good solid twenty years

706
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:56,390
teaching people to make these terrible
passwords

707
00:45:56,390 --> 00:46:01,020
so it's gonna take some time to on do
that and giving everybody the password

708
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,370
is like a good way to start

709
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:06,060
because people do care me honestly with
was beyond most of the

710
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:09,600
most the attacks still come from the
outside

711
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:13,190
Edwardson owns a rare and he's the hero

712
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:20,190
thank you yes

713
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,210
using lol not less like the iPhone using
sensors

714
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:28,600
I yes and no I don't have

715
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,710
I mean I don't have bomb I California
knows how to party

716
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:36,580
in any of my wordless or and a killer
but don't push me

717
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:40,710
government is the next 3s 2s in cookies
like that's not a word list anywhere

718
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:47,710
it might be in 20 years we can fix our
password ideas but judge

719
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:08,350
in the in the sense a brute forcing well
if you're looking at but we're doing a

720
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:09,590
character stop

721
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:12,770
honestly like the the and I get that
like you for doing like this it's

722
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:14,000
engineer reporting

723
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,760
the the question is we're doing it for
newsmaker we deal with just arm

724
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,960
just just sheer run John against a list
I hasher's

725
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,010
yeah you can is just a while and I don't
like the way

726
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:27,400
I'll wait if it's worth it but I mean if
I can

727
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:32,000
oh you mean to

728
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,430
to pull this out yet here

729
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:40,500
yeah I mean its base and that's that's
what we've done with that sorted list

730
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,950
me with it's all of our own cracking
files in tenured over there

731
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:49,050
we is/are structure

732
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:52,610
yes

733
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:56,290
correct course very stable is a my word
list no have never found it

734
00:47:56,290 --> 00:48:03,290
yes sir

735
00:48:07,579 --> 00:48:11,109
I V 30 days is is about us as much as
folks with words

736
00:48:11,109 --> 00:48:16,670
how

737
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:20,930
along with depends on if it were my
wireless and depends on how quickly I

738
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:22,920
can brute force if I have to do that

739
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:28,890
I fun doing 2.4 billion at times per
second

740
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:32,400
at nine characters with all four type
the characters all that you do the math

741
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:32,880
cuz

742
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:37,039
now not thirty days

743
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:44,039
less than 30 days but so you're limiting
impact yet that's when your other

744
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:44,849
control

745
00:48:44,849 --> 00:48:50,480
if you're if you're other controls are
in place and you see someone log in to

746
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,299
assist like this is another thing that I
complain about when I get on princess

747
00:48:53,299 --> 00:48:56,809
everybody logs failed logins how many
people will

748
00:48:56,809 --> 00:49:02,119
lot successful Lions so if I grab credit
on long and 50 machines that that person

749
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:05,089
has never logged into before and nobody
knows that happen

750
00:49:05,089 --> 00:49:09,010
but probably an issue so that's where
the defense has come n

751
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:12,010
if I suddenly start accessing all the
stuff from places it's never been seen

752
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:12,650
before

753
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:15,900
anomaly detection to kick in right

754
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:22,900
real time Seim yes

755
00:49:24,809 --> 00:49:27,630
it yep

756
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:31,359
wasn't in scope that nice just was off
the hook in my opinion PC eyes on the

757
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:31,900
hook for that

758
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:38,900
as my on professional opinion

759
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:45,049
right yep

760
00:49:45,049 --> 00:49:49,390
now it's yeah that's that yeah that was
a bottle so walk with early

761
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:54,520
thank you so much for your time will be
around
