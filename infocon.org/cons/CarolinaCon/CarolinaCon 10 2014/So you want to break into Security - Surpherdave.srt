20
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:11,740
you know just take that to to mind I
mean it's a standard disclaimer so

21
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,450
please

22
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,390
everything I'm about to say citations
following it

23
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:21,140
alright so just a little background
about me and this is how

24
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,210
kind of I love the pH ended up in my
name a surfer day

25
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,619
for one answer for Dave like you can
imagine there's probably a million

26
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:29,399
surfers

27
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:33,750
out there named Dave that they want to
call himself for Friday I

28
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,450
truck with the pH in there instead but I
was a phone free her from

29
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,750
from back in the old a I'll and

30
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,530
my a lease back then was a gatekeeper
because

31
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,789
Ghostbusters just came out in um you
know

32
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:51,140
I figured that's probably not going to
be you know stick around for too much

33
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:51,940
longer but

34
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:56,149
so I was on PBS's ended boxing back
today cuz my cousins live in

35
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,250
philadelphia I lived in Virginia so

36
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:02,759
you know wanna talk on the phone I
started my IT career in high school

37
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,479
in ninety-four it was the hacking
contest the IT director at the high

38
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,660
school said anyone can get into this
Apple

39
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:13,770
get the job and there's like this law
some debug switching you're on a couple

40
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,040
commands on it

41
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,349
and you're good to go um I moved in from
there to buy printer repair & Internet

42
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:21,470
working so I did

43
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:26,830
Novell and Microsoft they did at Cisco I
did Citrix I did VMware

44
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:31,090
got my CISSP um and then I moved into

45
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,129
data center management and then onto

46
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:37,310
a seesaw role so that just little
background on

47
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:42,870
and where I came from but I had to make
a really hard decision in my life

48
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,609
I know a lot are you guys if you've done
data center management or anything

49
00:02:46,609 --> 00:02:47,430
really hard

50
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,260
it's a lot a long hours and you really
don't have a life

51
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:56,709
doing and my wife a she she can attest
to that like 67 sixty-plus hours a week

52
00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:00,560
in a sense that things plus if you
manage peaks

53
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,180
arm you have to do with so many issues
that you normally wouldn't like I had

54
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,180
one guy that would

55
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,780
come into my office every couple weeks
hey boss

56
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,090
Asia come down and stroke me he would
say that

57
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,549
any man is ego but I was thinking the
helms got talking about so

58
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:22,370
um you know that that type of thing in
the United another person that was

59
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,329
addicted to

60
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:28,180
to painkillers and had to do with that
whole FMLA stuff on like this is crazy

61
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,920
why my doing this to myself

62
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,730
so I thought to myself like security
people were

63
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,799
awesome people mean the community at
large

64
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,299
the technical stuff that we do you can't
find it

65
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:45,609
anywhere else in it. um

66
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:48,709
so like I can have this

67
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:52,269
awesome career and have normal work
hours

68
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:56,590
learn stuff and do stuff that is super
badass

69
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,239
way I need a fair how to do this

70
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,510
so I googled it like good

71
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,549
the Google dork us um

72
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:10,359
yep you have no idea how to how to get
into securities that's why I came up

73
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:11,200
with this talk

74
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,700
because for me it was a transformation
process those fairy

75
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,310
difficult because I'm still in New

76
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:21,889
I mean a red team are now but I'm still
in New we all are

77
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:26,030
at some point our lives going to have to
say you know I got a transfer from

78
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:29,260
this super stressful job into something
else

79
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:34,050
so bill cosby is one of the greatest
philosophers

80
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:38,240
var time and if anyone doesn't believe
comedians are time are philosophers they

81
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:38,820
are

82
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,960
are comedians are CS Lewis's are Dave
Chapelle

83
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,580
everything relates to our life so Bill
Cosby told

84
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,790
this story he was asleep in bed

85
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:54,200
and usually is wife gets up makes a good
breakfasts and

86
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,550
you know it does all these things and
she didn't want to get up that day so

87
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,750
is like you go down there make the kids
breakfast

88
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:06,120
so is going on there make kids breakfast
then thought my time and i really wanna

89
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,670
be doing this

90
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:10,910
how can I make this easier and make it
so that I don't have to

91
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,370
ever do this again so he's looking
around

92
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,050
try to figure out my four-year-old sees
a chocolate cake

93
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,890
things like when it struck a cake Scott
exits got mail

94
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:26,380
it's got all these things that I have
Robert I need for breakfast

95
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,840
so he says yes you can have chocolate
cake and gifts trucker take all the kids

96
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,870
as whitcomb sounds like

97
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:36,840
what are you doing stomach ache this too
early in the morning for chocolate cake

98
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,700
go back up to bed go to sleep I'll take
your the kids

99
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,850
so bill cosby copy want a

100
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:48,300
a quote from him it takes great thinking
and work to keep on working

101
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,030
or as I like to say it takes a lot of
work

102
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,470
from doing out to keep from doing work

103
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:59,060
which is what I was doing our students
so much incredible work

104
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,210
and getting nowhere so I had to learn

105
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:09,190
to do a lot more on the front and from
the back and I can enjoy my life

106
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:13,790
so you want to get into security the
real security professional I am NOT

107
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,700
discounting everyone else it's in

108
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:20,130
other roles and stuff like that blue
team guys the guys that are defensive

109
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,790
super important roles absolutely the
guys that are

110
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,400
doing firewall stuff and everything out
so I i speakers right here in this is

111
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,940
these are my experiences

112
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,190
so you need to learn somethings

113
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,760
you have to be comfortable at the tools
that you use and

114
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,450
you guys are obviously here to learn
something new like

115
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:43,750
I learned something new this weekend its
gonna make my job awesome

116
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,500
the veil free or guys a their new stuff

117
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,310
is Graham Rd use the you know some other
stuff before

118
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:56,240
to make sure that uniting bypass AB but
now I've got all these other tools

119
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,930
to use to to do post exploitation

120
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:04,230
so from I'm I'm generally thinking that
a lot of people have a comfortable

121
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,490
knowledgeable annex

122
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,770
and that's an important thing with the

123
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:14,530
any kind of security pen testing
profession is that you want to get into

124
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:18,640
a unit in know the basic so 1x inside
and out

125
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,420
out Cali a or backtrack

126
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:27,050
very succinct but there's so many

127
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,570
tools that you have to learn their

128
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:36,480
next one review conference is a sinister
posted iron eat is a great example of

129
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,780
somebody that probably needs to not do
so many drugs

130
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:45,510
but on his website you will see posted
after every event that he records he

131
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,080
just put another one up

132
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,660
a I think yesterday on a full conference

133
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,680
the report city it's posted find
something on their

134
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,720
in review that learn those tools that it
posted their

135
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,360
Python Ruby in Pearl pick one of those

136
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,160
flavors at least learn how to read it I
am NOT a developer and I'm

137
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,110
horrible at developing I got my wife in
to do in Python

138
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,400
because I didn't want to do it and I
figured

139
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,870
no should be good on Python um

140
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,650
at least learn how to read it about the
Peter standard thus a pen testing

141
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:25,160
execution standard this is how

142
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,050
to formulate your ideas would a
different attack strategies

143
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,969
that's a good place to learn I give a
shout out to

144
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:36,479
the samurai I web testing framework it's
another

145
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,490
Linux distribution that does worth Cali
does a lot of network-based up in a lot

146
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,510
of different things

147
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:46,860
summarize basically a distribution that
handles

148
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:51,350
just web application and testing it's
got all the tools kinda baked into it

149
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:55,120
really nice build a a builder homeland

150
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,250
so you can't learn these tools now wanna
talk about a home i'm talking about.

151
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,829
something more than just the PC running
like VMware VirtualBox something like

152
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:03,560
that

153
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,589
you physically have machines achievement
test against

154
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:11,569
that's key because you're gonna have to
run what we're testing these things were

155
00:09:11,569 --> 00:09:13,600
to exploit and things like that ur

156
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,810
learning individual you really need to
use something like Wireshark to

157
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:21,149
analyze what's going on to come to learn
those tools as well

158
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:25,149
love this stuff happens at a lower level
at the horse I model

159
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:29,089
then you would you know running an
exporter or something like that so

160
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:32,999
building that I can't stress that more
than anything like that's where I

161
00:09:32,999 --> 00:09:36,249
learn my mice my skill set

162
00:09:36,249 --> 00:09:40,339
in the building your own tools so fire
up something like

163
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:43,930
I'm a big fan Davion some people like to
point to

164
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:47,290
um fire up your distribution

165
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:51,709
use you know get Harbor SourceForge or
whatever pull down the tools

166
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:56,569
get them working on your own so that she
can learn how those tools install

167
00:09:56,569 --> 00:10:00,160
because a lot of us getting kinda lazy
when it comes to like

168
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,829
relying on Collier backtrack to you you
know just you and upgrade an update when

169
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:06,529
we need those tools fixed

170
00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:11,220
plus if you like me Cali doesn't do the
best job handling

171
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:16,220
everything like the 32 bit version does
different things in the 64-bit version

172
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,680
and both from break when you add
something to it so if you can learn how

173
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,540
to build your own salsa

174
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,410
then you're going to be much more
successful specifically around

175
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:28,879
things like Metasploit if you ever get
minutes what pro

176
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,860
um those types of things the veil
framework finally is

177
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:37,740
you know made it into Cali which is
great but before it was a headache to

178
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,170
get installed and working correctly so

179
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,499
learn how to do it yourself

180
00:10:43,499 --> 00:10:46,519
in up CL beanie

181
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:49,999
a actually came up a he was a

182
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:54,050
person is talking about persuasion a the
heart persuasion

183
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:57,680
so you're not learning techniques you
don't take these tools and learn

184
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,120
techniques because

185
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,670
it takes several thousand hours to learn
a skill

186
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:07,100
so you can have a lot of work ahead like
I said it takes a lot of work to keep

187
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,839
from doing

188
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,519
work so what

189
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,970
really suits your personality that's
kinda what you have to look at

190
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,430
if your career building right now or try
make a change

191
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:22,709
are happy where you are even what build
you know what what

192
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:26,839
really is your personality style you
like building stuff up

193
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,629
and making it secure do you like
breaking things

194
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:35,360
like or you like controlling things up I
use those three examples because you

195
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,740
have a red team

196
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,889
are are the first ones building is would
be

197
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:44,149
the architecture side of security
breaking things would be the red

198
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:47,749
red team in controlling would be the
blue in the White team

199
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:51,100
what you wanna do you wanna stop the bad
guys wanna replicate the bad guys

200
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,709
so really what kind of like drives you

201
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:58,759
what makes you tingle explore the entire
world security there's so many aspects

202
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,790
of it

203
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:03,249
want one thing I'd love to do were two
things

204
00:12:03,249 --> 00:12:06,970
crypto which I'm not smart enough to do
so I can't do that

205
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,050
and reversing our would be amazing I'm

206
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:13,449
you know just this is an example

207
00:12:13,449 --> 00:12:17,870
um as you're reading all these industry
articles and if you're not doing that

208
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,569
then

209
00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:22,259
you never gonna make pretty far what's
the most appealing thing that people are

210
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:25,559
doing that appeals to you specifically

211
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:28,709
in I S is questioning my boss I'll

212
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:33,009
you know what would you do when you win
the lottery he said he'd open up a small

213
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:34,499
security consulting firm

214
00:12:34,499 --> 00:12:38,730
and help it grow so if you're not
dedicated this

215
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:42,089
like you won the lottery and said peace
out i'm going to Barbados

216
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:45,720
I'm mad at him out at the whole scene if
you think

217
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,199
you win the lottery in you'd say I would
continue to

218
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:52,319
grow my security career in help people

219
00:12:52,319 --> 00:12:59,319
become more secure then that's probably
which me to continue doing

220
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:02,730
okay so now we're gonna switch just a
little bit

221
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:08,610
um 2007 target acquisition for like I
like the caller open source intelligence

222
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:11,949
so when you're going for an interview
are you talking are you looking at a

223
00:13:11,949 --> 00:13:12,930
company

224
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:17,819
me too become in it assessment mindset

225
00:13:17,819 --> 00:13:22,629
you need to start thinking what are
these guys actually looking for and what

226
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:24,899
can I say to make them hire me

227
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:28,449
so you identify the the organization
that

228
00:13:28,449 --> 00:13:31,529
is the best suited for you in this case

229
00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:35,639
I did move it cost me a lot of money to
move from why

230
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:39,269
to move to North Carolina out for me was
a great decision

231
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:43,889
and I love what I do now but it was a
big sacrifice because I love family LS

232
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:47,439
surfing I like diving a left all that
stuff behind

233
00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:51,170
to come here just so I could you know be
part of that team

234
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:56,369
see need to find out what organizations
gonna be the best fit for you

235
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:59,670
now recruiters are a major pain in the

236
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:03,369
but they're gonna send you everything

237
00:14:03,369 --> 00:14:08,170
hey you look like you might be a great
fit for our firewall

238
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:12,160
administrator I've never touched the
firewall my life I think I heard someone

239
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,970
said

240
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:17,329
you know earlier like why why would you
think I'm fit for that so

241
00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:20,769
what you can do with the recruiters is
actually take that information

242
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:26,689
copy n paste into Google find out what
actual company is looking for that job

243
00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:29,980
they go after the company leader
recruiter behind because he's going to

244
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,339
be a big major in your neck

245
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:37,439
anyone identify interviewers now I just
tell you a quick story about that

246
00:14:37,439 --> 00:14:41,019
the the guy actually that I got the job
with

247
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:45,439
currently um I targeted him

248
00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:50,110
the myosin on him I found out everything
about his life that was online

249
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:53,519
now I might seem a creepy but whatever
its online

250
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,999
means everyone can look at it a man
actually found out he was speaking at

251
00:14:56,999 --> 00:14:58,290
Derby Conn

252
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:02,350
and told all my friends that I'd made in
the security community that was going to

253
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,800
wreak on

254
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,279
I want you guys always sit on the very
front row

255
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,420
and when he's done speaking on what you
guys to stand up in cloud

256
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:14,980
and then afterwards go telling how
amazing I am and what I'm doing

257
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,540
hey you know what now the guy knows why
im so

258
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:22,639
it worked really well said so think
outside of a your normal parameters when

259
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:22,949
you're

260
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:26,110
when you're talking about in arrears and
things like that

261
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:29,689
you find something to connect them with
you it's going to be

262
00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:35,600
any networks probably for any job
without specifically work for me

263
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,369
um okay social engineering and I'll

264
00:15:39,369 --> 00:15:43,809
there were some massive talk on Friday
night that was just crazy on

265
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,999
your linguistic programming hypnosis and

266
00:15:46,999 --> 00:15:50,920
by the and my head was bleeding the
basics you need to know about social

267
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,980
engineering

268
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:57,480
for career building a you know in
conferences and social events

269
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,029
now last night I spent I don't know how
many hours and how many drinks

270
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:05,709
hanging out with different people well I
don't remember everybody in sight

271
00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:10,220
partners for that um but just just a
little background on

272
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,619
why mention this talk you into speaker
party so

273
00:16:13,619 --> 00:16:16,790
it was black hat

274
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,819
20 2008 or 2009 I can remember

275
00:16:19,819 --> 00:16:23,600
um in the speaker parted just let out

276
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,739
course I was in a lot in the speaker
part because I was just nobody at that

277
00:16:26,739 --> 00:16:27,540
point

278
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,059
I got my way in and start talking to you

279
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:34,999
Dan Kaminsky asking him some things and

280
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:38,889
learn that some learned some things and
we ended up all going across the street

281
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:40,639
where oh she's used to be

282
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,489
it's not there anymore and drinking all
night talking about more things

283
00:16:44,489 --> 00:16:49,199
in the Sun came up in and ends like I
gotta go on a tandem like cool

284
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,989
a we had stayed up all night talking

285
00:16:52,989 --> 00:16:56,139
so if you pay attention to those ideas
like I did

286
00:16:56,139 --> 00:17:01,429
%uh they were booked him afterwards and
say you know it's a really great idea

287
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:04,949
DNS security now it's just the generic
thing

288
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:09,620
um he's like yeah absolutely that's what
I've been thinking about the entire time

289
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,750
now there's like is just the guy that's
like

290
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:17,630
you know i i can. I can reach out to him
talk to me coming to

291
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,709
really kuwait's and to get yourself into

292
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:25,589
a popular somebody that's a really
influential speaker

293
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:29,390
now we're talking about paying attention
to speaker ideas

294
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:33,270
you see some guys here this weekend they
were amazing and they have their own

295
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,670
projects

296
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:38,020
he to get going back to the veil guys
because

297
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:41,230
you know that's one thing that I really
have used in past

298
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:44,450
but it's all stuff that they've done on
their own and they don't get paid for

299
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,659
and it's all open source

300
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:50,960
so volunteer your time you need to get
out there and

301
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,240
and work with the community

302
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,289
to to better their products so you're
not some

303
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:03,450
you I think I actually own a talk about
that here in few other sites but

304
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:08,110
we're gonna you know when when you talk
about a

305
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:15,110
weeks take one step back I'm with

306
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:19,370
volunteering your time to work on a
project

307
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:23,429
they don't just need the superb badass
hackers they don't need

308
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:26,470
somebody that can write the scripts for
them

309
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:29,649
need someone that can document technical
things

310
00:18:29,649 --> 00:18:33,149
the someone they can run quality
assurance so that's another way to get

311
00:18:33,149 --> 00:18:35,470
yourself in

312
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:38,880
with people that actually know what
they're really doing

313
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,000
so that thats the basis of the slide
here so not all this I'm definitely not

314
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,519
super hacker

315
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:48,500
um still they need all these different
types and supports

316
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,730
to find these guys that are really doing
what they're doing in and

317
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,149
review their blogs their talks speak up

318
00:18:55,149 --> 00:18:58,539
talk to them because most of these guys
are doing this are the love

319
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:01,919
industry get your name on several
projects

320
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,470
on get home and now all of a sudden when
you interview with somebody

321
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:09,200
they can go and look and get them like
man it's guys all over the place

322
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,760
and you're not credited with you know
saying well this guy which is the show

323
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,110
that wrote the technical stuff

324
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:18,649
your credit with everybody else on there

325
00:19:18,649 --> 00:19:22,440
ants super hackers had to start
somewhere there is a company called

326
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,289
secure state

327
00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:28,309
in in Cleveland and I know a lot of guys
that have evolved from secure state they

328
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:32,090
started their didn't really have too
much of a technical background

329
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:35,919
and after they left their their the Dave
kennedy's in the world

330
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,179
there's two guys on my team from there
and they're super amazing

331
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:43,779
so they had to start somewhere but they
had assistance from somewhere else

332
00:19:43,779 --> 00:19:48,080
that they would help them grow so always
you don't think I've yourself is like

333
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,269
I'm not amazing

334
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:57,169
but how can I contribute to somebody
that is amazing they can make me better

335
00:19:57,169 --> 00:20:02,390
now crowdsourcing we talked about this a
little bit um

336
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:05,929
so we meet a lot of people icon makin
you know

337
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:09,220
especially like after having a few
drinks

338
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:13,179
ask them to you know what their email
addresses

339
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:17,179
sir you know can I Cup contact me
further if you make enough connections

340
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:18,159
with people

341
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,330
yes in the right to a reference a
specific person that can

342
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:24,679
you know speak to what you discussed

343
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:29,070
and approach people you know have have
people in the community like I mentioned

344
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:29,860
before the

345
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:33,090
the the crowd sourcing thing

346
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:36,220
have them approach you know somebody
that you know it's gonna

347
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,049
you know speak to your to your expertise

348
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:43,279
an example I have is a Rafael much

349
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:46,779
I sat in through one of his classes any
actually

350
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:50,600
said you pretty good at what you do and
I asked them take could you

351
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,659
perhaps write a reference for me if you
get a reference from

352
00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:58,210
you know somebody that that's a super
hacker and that's pretty

353
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:04,789
that's pretty good at that's going to
get you to open a few doors

354
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:08,190
alright cool volunteering for the win um

355
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:11,620
now for one thing

356
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,620
this conference you know here is

357
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,760
100 percent done by volunteers

358
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,870
and they do an amazing job in fact

359
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:24,990
I would be after speaking if I had
probably hadn't volunteered to

360
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:28,490
to work at a conference so you need to
sign up

361
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:31,649
you need to help out the community is
all about

362
00:21:31,649 --> 00:21:34,380
you're giving you know it's all about
voluntary is all about giving back to

363
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,899
the community see need to sign up
volunteering

364
00:21:36,899 --> 00:21:41,380
everywhere you go if there is a a
seminar obviously if you're going arce

365
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:45,039
which isn't technically a security
conference anymore you probably have

366
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,990
your volunteer but any these grassroots
type things

367
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:51,149
the b-sides the Carolina cons

368
00:21:51,149 --> 00:21:54,580
um volunteer

369
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,820
and be responsible you want to stand out
you wanna make

370
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:01,690
everyone know who you are much do
because that's how you gonna meet these

371
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,169
people

372
00:22:03,169 --> 00:22:07,399
um speaking at conferences is something
very difficult

373
00:22:07,399 --> 00:22:10,779
um for me I have a social anxiety
problem

374
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:14,279
when it comes to being in crowds in
groups and things like that I

375
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:17,289
really have a hard time have a special
cocktail that I

376
00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:21,710
used to be able to see attend these
types of things and it kinda works

377
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:25,149
um but there's a mentorship program

378
00:22:25,149 --> 00:22:29,340
at b-sides Las Vegas which I'm a a
member

379
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,340
and I think a lotta conferences have
something similar where you can actually

380
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,630
find someone

381
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:36,639
they can teach you how to speak at a
security conference

382
00:22:36,639 --> 00:22:40,269
because there's a lot of things that you
need to know how to write a proper

383
00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:44,500
up you know call for paper how to
actually speak

384
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,740
without sound like an idiot which are
probably do but I've been to the program

385
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,960
a anything you know this this year
actually get to help mentor somebody

386
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,860
which is really cool

387
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,809
i mean i havent spoke it for the b-sides
and 20

388
00:22:56,809 --> 00:23:00,649
12 or something like that and they said
hey want to come back as a mentor like

389
00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:01,000
ice

390
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,740
I'm not that great speaking but I'll be
glad to help I can because I love the

391
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,519
volunteer

392
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:08,929
and so that's you know one of the things
that you get to do

393
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,789
and then hit me more amazing people
they're trying to break into the skewed

394
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:13,049
profession as well

395
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:16,110
and make more connections

396
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:20,580
when you're volunteering you'll get
access to everybody that is speaking

397
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:24,460
so you have people here that are usually
not as

398
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,610
easy to get to you if you go into a
black hat are def con

399
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:31,750
because there's like tens of thousands
of people that are gonna brush them

400
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:35,240
but if you end up being a volunteer in
the speaker and you're you're in charge

401
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,220
of like security for like a

402
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,490
a speaker lounger anything like that
you're going to have

403
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:43,889
axis to those folks directly

404
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:47,760
that you don't get at a normal
conference

405
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,960
so you need to make friends and
influence people that's an important

406
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,500
thing

407
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,740
that's volunteering and I show

408
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:59,330
and then you build and maintain your
network so

409
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:04,029
the people that you do me you need to
continue to keep those relationships up

410
00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:10,190
because it'll help you build your cell
and build your career path

411
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:13,460
alright so this is questions for this
section I'm gonna

412
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:17,610
going to another section a after this

413
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:21,950
as anyone any questions about what I was
talking about because I do

414
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:26,190
from anyone sure I just said okay

415
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:29,470
call so

416
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:32,580
I want to break this out a little bit

417
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,840
and talk about what I do you as a
redeemer

418
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,730
but I couldn't bring myself to do it as
a cow need a job and I just before why

419
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:40,799
no have any money

420
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,700
left from that new the fair talk about
the previous job

421
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,779
that I worked for into it was for a
large Government Association

422
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:55,440
in the state of Texas so take massive
amounts 254 counties

423
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,049
local government entities in Texas

424
00:24:59,049 --> 00:25:03,039
and I like to call it a threat landscape
with local government

425
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,769
so that the basis of local government as
all these different people

426
00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:10,539
if you look at the a break out of a
courthouse you have all these different

427
00:25:10,539 --> 00:25:12,299
folks that are elected officials

428
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:15,639
now how do you become elected official
elected official

429
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:18,889
just means you're popular enough for
people to vote for you

430
00:25:18,889 --> 00:25:23,059
it's a I finish high school but you know
I'm pretty cool

431
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:27,090
so yes vote for me a minute happens
quite often actually

432
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:30,360
especially in smaller smaller counties

433
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,080
so you have all these different guys
here and they all have their different

434
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,600
opinions about how things should be done

435
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:41,070
and local government and everyone fights
because they let me go that's why the

436
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:43,820
politicians

437
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:46,909
what is any this matter because you have

438
00:25:46,909 --> 00:25:50,139
all this information that

439
00:25:50,139 --> 00:25:53,320
is at their fingertips that's super easy
disclose

440
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:58,009
yet non-public information stuff that
should never leave like tax information

441
00:25:58,009 --> 00:25:59,610
you get birth certificates and

442
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:03,889
tax records and stuff that's you know

443
00:26:03,889 --> 00:26:08,039
personally identifiable information to
secure numbers driving records criminal

444
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:09,210
records

445
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:12,940
and the coolest thing about it is like
the local governments all have

446
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,870
communication channels back into the
apartment Homeland Security

447
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:20,009
that is a federal mandate the came down
and said every local government agency

448
00:26:20,009 --> 00:26:21,320
has to be able to get back

449
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,850
the HS om what's the problem with that

450
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:29,049
so the internal issues love local
government

451
00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:32,549
there's a lack of education about what's
that means like for example

452
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:36,159
I use a Freedom of Information Act I've
been able to go to counties and do an

453
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,360
assessment

454
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,399
and fill out a form you know allows me
to get the information that I need

455
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:45,929
under the Freedom of Information Act but
the clerk's office

456
00:26:45,929 --> 00:26:49,019
the most part they don't see those local
government then on have a clue what

457
00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:49,440
those

458
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,299
those really mean side across the I need
every birth certificate for last 20

459
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:56,149
years

460
00:26:56,149 --> 00:27:00,090
what social security numbers attached
flood across desk

461
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:03,600
to give me back information that seems
like a

462
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,600
a big problem um

463
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,850
like a funding is a a major problem for

464
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:13,070
for local government now back in Texas
we had

465
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:16,679
some massive problems in and I i think
it's pretty

466
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:21,070
goes crossed most states a

467
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:24,360
what happens in local government you
have unfunded mandates and what an

468
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,630
unfunded mandate is

469
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:30,500
that the the local government will set
their budget

470
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,970
and it's set in stone and basically they
don't have any more money to spend

471
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:37,000
local government says hey we need a
special are the the state government

472
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,179
says hey we need a special election call

473
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:43,519
it's gonna cost the local government
220,000 to

474
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:47,450
250,000 staff and provide this type of
thing that they didn't budget for

475
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:51,730
what happens it. just goes

476
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:56,330
IT director gets cut or dismissed and
we're gonna go to a local mom-and-pop

477
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:57,259
shop

478
00:27:57,259 --> 00:28:00,700
to doing tax caps another problem

479
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:04,120
a because everyone is wanna pay taxes
and

480
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:08,190
the state governments as well we want to
do what the people want

481
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:12,759
we're going to limit what we can't acces
folks at and I know we all hate taxes

482
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:16,759
but the average but IT director that I

483
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:21,970
you know figured out it was making fifty
thousand dollars a year

484
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:25,419
and some in the summer and smaller
government some in the smaller counties

485
00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:29,440
section twenty four thousand dollars a
year yes are the bigger ones me more

486
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,009
but around fifty thousand dollars a year
to run the entire

487
00:28:33,009 --> 00:28:36,120
you know local government you're not
going to get the cream of the crop a lot

488
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:36,659
of times

489
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:40,950
when it comes IT directors because %uh
those caps they cannot hire somebody in

490
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,080
budget for it

491
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,679
because they have different caption that
the salary restrictions

492
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,809
um probably had texas big time was the

493
00:28:48,809 --> 00:28:52,309
any county that bordered Mexico

494
00:28:52,309 --> 00:28:56,899
I mean the guys down there the sheriff's
deputies were making eighteen thousand

495
00:28:56,899 --> 00:28:59,129
dollars a year

496
00:28:59,129 --> 00:29:03,809
and a the the sheriff itself like 30,000

497
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:08,750
so what happens when a guy says hey I
I'm gonna run drugs you're counting

498
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:11,909
you're gonna look the other way here's
eighty thousand dollars or we'll kill

499
00:29:11,909 --> 00:29:14,250
everyone your family

500
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:17,460
that's that's a big problem now
obviously North Carolina probably

501
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,440
doesn't have

502
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,950
a similar thing but I I know that there
is a lot of

503
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:28,950
payments that probably go underhanded to
get things moved around

504
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:32,940
and there's a general mistrust like I
was saying before

505
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:37,169
is like a cooperation with in the
government itself

506
00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:40,860
the judge thinks he's the head
accounting

507
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,809
the commissioner thinks he's ahead at
the county the clerk want something to

508
00:29:44,809 --> 00:29:48,230
say the sheriff on something they say
everybody's got something to say

509
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:52,360
the politicians everyone's got something
to say

510
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,429
so what happens you have bolt on
software

511
00:29:55,429 --> 00:29:59,419
a lot of times like so the judge says
hey I wanna be we'll see all the

512
00:29:59,419 --> 00:30:01,190
criminal records that are coming out

513
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:05,639
love the Jayla Minister's Office well we
don't have the software for that but

514
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:06,080
there's a

515
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,299
out on that we can put on there so you
have all those bolted on software

516
00:30:10,299 --> 00:30:14,509
every county and zip with a different
piece of software that's all bolted on

517
00:30:14,509 --> 00:30:18,139
if the inexperienced are the missing it.
stuff there's a lot of places that

518
00:30:18,139 --> 00:30:23,429
outsource all their IT local mom-and-pop
shops that have no idea about security

519
00:30:23,429 --> 00:30:27,149
in the offender hell this kit these
vendors come in they say hey we can do

520
00:30:27,149 --> 00:30:29,190
all these things for you

521
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:32,309
all we need is some money in the getting
there

522
00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:36,149
and they start charging these fees they
just rob the county by

523
00:30:36,149 --> 00:30:39,549
in the county is no budget to be able to
do anything about it

524
00:30:39,549 --> 00:30:42,700
and one assessment we did it was a
vendor that

525
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:47,570
was for seventeen different counties

526
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:51,460
everything was just over HTTP there was
no encrypt to traffic

527
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:55,870
anywhere intense this was like between
jail administrators office the sheriff's

528
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:56,440
office

529
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,340
the judge the Commissioner the clerk's
office all these records were just

530
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:04,169
and in clear text there's nothing being
cryptic

531
00:31:04,169 --> 00:31:07,019
and they're like a got the information
you wanna we've been saying what

532
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:09,309
security

533
00:31:09,309 --> 00:31:13,129
in an another she's a dog hissing match
is that you have

534
00:31:13,129 --> 00:31:16,820
between this different community it's
politics

535
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:20,460
solid urine sample

536
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:25,000
and so we need you assessments on these
types of things and I urge you guys to

537
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,649
contact some your local government folks

538
00:31:28,649 --> 00:31:31,809
because this is our major problem and
and if you can

539
00:31:31,809 --> 00:31:36,710
volunteer to to do with these types of
assassins you have

540
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:40,039
this is nothing that is like super
technical nature you

541
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:43,080
all low hanging fruit like a an open
wireless

542
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,330
in the the courtroom that's connected
back to the

543
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:49,570
to the server and Active Directory you
know those types of things are

544
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:54,110
really common easy things is fine the
website sat on a few for venue county

545
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,499
website if you live in a pretty raw
County

546
00:31:56,499 --> 00:32:00,249
the county website probably looks pretty
horrible from like netscape days

547
00:32:00,249 --> 00:32:04,019
or maybe even like gose it's pretty bad

548
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:07,850
and its they take they take taxes they
take a.m.

549
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:11,860
you can look at the restrictions you can
look up GIS information

550
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:15,370
all these things and I mean this is
horrible use for automated Skinner

551
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:18,809
against the end of his break everything
on the website

552
00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:22,070
its it's really bad so if you know
anything about that are

553
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:25,379
you know at least talk to somebody if
you find something there really really

554
00:32:25,379 --> 00:32:26,629
bad

555
00:32:26,629 --> 00:32:30,730
um and basic social engineering attacks
they're very susceptible cuz

556
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:35,940
because a block a budget obviously
there's no training program for anybody

557
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:40,470
in local government about what to do
when it comes to social engineering

558
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:43,659
so walking like I mentioned before
freedom of information act

559
00:32:43,659 --> 00:32:46,940
here's your documents sir thank you very
much I'll

560
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:51,529
I walked into one place this is a very
successful taca

561
00:32:51,529 --> 00:32:54,769
I think it did to places like it might
be a bust wanna but

562
00:32:54,769 --> 00:32:58,309
a basically I found out who the IT
director as

563
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:01,980
the company and he was going to launch a
certain time

564
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,279
I call a cent in arkansas key IT
director is

565
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,299
always gone to lunch what's his name you
know

566
00:33:08,299 --> 00:33:11,740
so-and-so okay so I walk in I just have
a basic

567
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:15,789
you know labeled shirt with VMware
something I like that on there

568
00:33:15,789 --> 00:33:19,740
and I slip a car to say hey so-and-so
said I need to go and check the server

569
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,659
room from this company answers to do it

570
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:24,659
open up the server room for me the
problem at all

571
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:28,309
and I just you know did a report due for
the hard drive

572
00:33:28,309 --> 00:33:31,919
um both sides to think they're not
trained at all because they don't have

573
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,330
the money to do it

574
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:38,460
even the IT directors have no idea about
the security threats

575
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:42,850
in they say they trust before the
verifying its very

576
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:46,730
very crazy his all this information and
facts

577
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:50,970
affects us equally they they hear you
the keys to

578
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:55,499
everything that we have so identity
theft Israel

579
00:33:55,499 --> 00:33:58,830
issue in vector I think it will harder
to execute because you have to go to

580
00:33:58,830 --> 00:33:59,249
mall

581
00:33:59,249 --> 00:34:03,909
counties to find out more spot some
information

582
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:07,720
so I urge you guys to you really take an
interest and

583
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,300
some you look government if you can
volunteer and help

584
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:16,010
it would really even if it's just basic
security awareness training

585
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:19,270
it would be really helpful that's all I
got

586
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:23,879
anyone have any questions if not I'm
surfer day

587
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:27,000
questions go thanks everybody
