1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,560
you good new

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:11,560
thank you

3
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,869
right everybody has

4
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:30,240
the has a summer a smartphone so the
concept

5
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,700
woo want be

6
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,430
alright is it loud now everybody can
hear me

7
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:43,470
especially in the back alright so the
constable smartphone

8
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,199
has emerged in the last five min 5 the
five years

9
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:50,750
and now you carry on he on

10
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,970
a computer in your with you all the time

11
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:58,059
and its powerful because you can extend

12
00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:02,460
these operating systems by downloading a
third party

13
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,220
appli- cations but here there is a risk
here because anybody now

14
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,220
out there can develop an app and put it
in the market

15
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,530
and so you use it without looking at
who's developing these application

16
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:19,070
a so because if that

17
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,850
are where a lot of attacks against ended
users

18
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,990
against their privacy and against their

19
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:30,600
a their phones a so

20
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,789
this is like a familiar screen that you
see whenever you get

21
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:38,380
I'll try to install an application from
the

22
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,450
online market it asks you for

23
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,869
permissions and this is the enter
security is building top

24
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:49,399
all permissions at that mission gives

25
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:52,969
these a third party applications the
privilege

26
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:57,159
to access your data and your smartphone
so

27
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:01,009
this is the fundamental concept in
security

28
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:04,399
in a into securities and users got to be

29
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,929
careful about downloading the air the
applications and granting those

30
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:12,550
permissions because once you got these
permissions its

31
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,910
just one time you say you have a chance
for one-time the Grand these permissions

32
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:21,130
after you got these permissions the only
thing that you can do is buy

33
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,330
uninstalling these applications to stop
them from axing your

34
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,300
a a date so as you can see this screen

35
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:34,000
there is to less the first in the
topmost

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,480
these permissions these are they
classify them as

37
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,490
dangerous permissions whereas the ones
that are hidden

38
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:46,040
and you need to click on the see all at
these are they classify them as a

39
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,700
regular

40
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,710
or on dangerous permissions so

41
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:53,020
they're not dangerous innocence that a
if they're not gonna

42
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,180
50 so

43
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,980
in the the literature is a full of
research

44
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,580
and projects on compromising on the I'll

45
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,010
users privacy and

46
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,170
these are some other publications that
we have done %uh the work in the

47
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,020
projects

48
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,150
in our and UNC Charlotte and

49
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,630
the one of them is about a kill others a
threat

50
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,950
and about also the of

51
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,260
the implementation of on smartphones

52
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,770
so we found that its wanna noble and

53
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,180
developers can easily hackett and in a

54
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:37,300
and still and steal your username and
password so that the move our work

55
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,630
at the OC shot or in our group is by

56
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:44,720
detecting or finding out what are the
potential threats

57
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,390
that me be targeted against users and

58
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,810
try to find and mitigation on defensive

59
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:57,460
mechanisms so as I said the focus has
been on the dangerous

60
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:01,100
permissions and there are very few
worked on the

61
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,520
a on the regular permissions so

62
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,840
we ask ourselves and so this is the
research the question is

63
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,410
can we use the enter at the regular
permissions

64
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:17,410
the compromise users privacy

65
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:21,979
so in so doing so to prove how to answer
the questions

66
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:25,320
we investigated the components of

67
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,289
Android application I forgot to mention
the reason we

68
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:33,800
Joe's enjoyed so the same concept supply
may be in

69
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,349
and the majority of their platforms but
injured because it's up in

70
00:04:38,349 --> 00:04:41,629
and flexible so we can download the
platform

71
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:45,860
weekend a change it also we can get the
source code of an application's

72
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,620
downloaded from the market so

73
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,699
back to our research a question can we
compromise

74
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:57,280
users privacy in enjoyed using

75
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,729
only normal permissions to answer the
questions

76
00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:03,960
we had to go into details into the comp
on ins

77
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,530
of and do it the into application

78
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,819
and these are the main components of any
application

79
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:14,449
we got the activities content provider

80
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:18,270
and broadcast receiver and services

81
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:22,979
and if you don't at the and manifest
file this is also comes with shipped

82
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:23,830
with the

83
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,120
AP K-five it's inside the ABT five that
you install in your

84
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,219
and machine it has all the config racin

85
00:05:31,219 --> 00:05:34,770
and some useful information that you can
another

86
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,840
about the application that you are
downloading to get this

87
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,999
a and manifest file from the ABK

88
00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:44,840
you don't need a lot hard tools are
sophisticated tools its easy

89
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,009
and those you can reverse engineer the
so still

90
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:51,639
or the application to learn the
developers behavior

91
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:55,020
and their security choices

92
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,400
so we looked at all the B stands an ass
consider ourselves the question

93
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,539
if we have only normal admissions

94
00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:06,789
with these getting components can we
compromise

95
00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:10,840
users primes

96
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,330
so the fund providers just give me a

97
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:18,129
hand about each component activity it's
the screen that you see

98
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:22,259
any whenever you to play with an
application

99
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:26,659
the content provider is the component
that manages the data

100
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:31,520
of an application and the broadcast
receiver

101
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,809
is the a sleeping agent that's why I
call it sleeping

102
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:40,150
agent because you're not aware of its
existence

103
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,520
and the services that runs in the in the
behind-the-scene

104
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,699
so the question was on the broadcast
receivers

105
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:52,740
we found that the broadcast receivers
ken a play a very dangerous role

106
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,870
because the users they don't pay
attention to these broadcast receivers

107
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,969
and the user's understanding of the
application

108
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:03,139
is as you are working with the
application

109
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:06,210
playing with it it can act as the
permission

110
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,409
and it can access your data but once you
close it

111
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:13,050
there is no axes would and once you turn
of

112
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,990
your application you can access and he
came run and it killed

113
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:21,900
but with broadcast receivers this is
this concept is

114
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:27,089
is not chill because with ended a with
the broadcast receivers you can register

115
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:31,789
your application to listen to the
Android system events

116
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:35,749
so you're the application is is a
sleeping diddly its it dead

117
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:38,839
and whenever something happened it will
wake up

118
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:41,949
and start performing some actions

119
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:45,409
behind-the-scene so this gives

120
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:49,279
a powerful and dangerous capability

121
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:54,499
to militias applications

122
00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:59,270
and the way you register those a in your
application as a developer

123
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,180
you can register them dynamic killing in
the the source code

124
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,539
all you can insert them on the many
fistfights

125
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:10,210
the configuration XML by and the
differences

126
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:13,400
the dynamic there's no problem with
dynamically registering

127
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,629
these broadcast receivers because it
makes sense

128
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:20,849
if the application in the foreground and
its active in running

129
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:24,330
the it has the right to look or listen
to the events

130
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:27,659
happening on the system but if it's and
the

131
00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:32,289
XML file then this break the security
and the user

132
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:39,289
awareness it listens to the evidence
even if the application is not bright

133
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:42,849
sought to gain more insights with we
started

134
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:46,130
looking at these broadcasts actions so

135
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,250
a each broadcast is considered an action

136
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,000
so whenever an action happens in the
opening system are the operating system

137
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,460
sends

138
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,029
all the this action to all the
registered applications

139
00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:00,850
and then the application that receives
this action can read some

140
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,940
more insights about the action and
perform

141
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,449
as something behind the sea

142
00:09:07,449 --> 00:09:10,910
and also we the would build the scenario

143
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:14,040
that where we can use a broadcast
receiver

144
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,440
and it their mission added unknown
permission to monitor

145
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,910
users geopolitical education

146
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:25,850
so first let's look at the evolution up
these broadcast a

147
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:30,620
receivers actions over because so far we
have nineteen

148
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:36,190
releases an EC the growth of the number
of broadcast actions

149
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:40,019
from d1 from the release one antilles

150
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:44,980
4.4 the get capped virgin

151
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:49,149
so overall there's an increase by
seventy-nine percent

152
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:53,360
so the more actions we have the more
information we cannot reveal about

153
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,440
our internal at the Hebrew a brain
system to the third party applications

154
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:04,320
which are not supposed to be trusted

155
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,550
and also it's not just increasing

156
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:11,079
by the numbers over the different
releases

157
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:14,320
someone these releases sometimes we add
more

158
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,670
sometimes we remove sometimes we sup an

159
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:21,199
some will like when you add and you
actions

160
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:24,399
the the way you explain this by adding
your actions

161
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,639
is with the evolving technology or and
hardware

162
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:31,699
for instance the Bluetooth was a but did
not exist in the past

163
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:35,649
so that we did not have any action to
report that

164
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:38,779
the Bluetooth a status changed

165
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:41,870
but the removing some of these actions

166
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:45,949
with did not yet fat find an answer

167
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:51,500
to this behavior and the Android a
platform

168
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,550
so the use case scenario we build an app

169
00:10:54,550 --> 00:11:01,540
that only has when activating and we
registered a broadcast receiver

170
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,680
and these are the broadcast receivers
that means my application

171
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,990
is going to listen to any connectivity
change

172
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,060
and it worked a idea a ID

173
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,440
a change and and is the change in all
these

174
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,120
considered by the a security experts as
a regular

175
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,180
and non threat I that does not

176
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,940
cause any threat on the user's privacy

177
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,690
so I did that installed in in my eye and
my smartphone

178
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:33,410
at and a smartphone and whenever
anything happens like this

179
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:37,190
I log the the a the ID for the network

180
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,920
and some other information about the
network the information that you can

181
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,529
axis without I'll needing I

182
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:49,410
dangerous permissions so I get this on
Google Docs

183
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:54,149
this were for this experiment

184
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:58,310
and I notice that I can aggregate this
information

185
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:02,529
but ministers over a week or a month and
I can learn

186
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:05,889
the when that at the user is leaving his
house

187
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:10,569
well where does he work and some other
information if he also goes to someone

188
00:12:10,569 --> 00:12:12,300
at coffee shops

189
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,959
so this is all very dangerous if
somebody knows when if you learned the

190
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:17,389
behavior about you

191
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:21,220
when do you leave your house when you
want to come back were you work and what

192
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,230
time you leave your work

193
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:25,480
especially if he's your boss you can
know what time you leaving work

194
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,970
right okay so

195
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:33,180
even the information more than that the
information that we collected

196
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,209
by just analyzing these information

197
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:40,079
itself we can learn we call it like

198
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,100
and turn and Alice's without using
annexed into knowledge

199
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,480
weekend there some private information
about our

200
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,029
about the user's and also more than that

201
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:55,940
we can aggregate more information
whatever we collected

202
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,470
what if you're if you know that are
there is a database

203
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:03,490
online that map and Asus ID for why
fines

204
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:08,040
to a geographical look Asian so you know
exactly where this

205
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,129
user exists right now or

206
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:14,440
look a so and usually no users

207
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,899
they're not willing to share them there
location

208
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:21,350
including myself so by using this

209
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:24,769
regular their missions we were able to

210
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:27,800
the to retrieve a user's location

211
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,730
without a asking for dangerous
permissions

212
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,870
so then the research question here is
yes we can use

213
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:40,180
a a regular user permissions and

214
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:44,079
to compromise users privacy

215
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,430
but we went further and you want to look
at the

216
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:51,319
broadcast receivers because we found
that this component nobody has touched

217
00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:52,430
before

218
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:56,459
and it's worthy of investigating

219
00:13:56,459 --> 00:14:00,190
so what to do in this without after we
realize that

220
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:04,069
broadcast receivers can be of a great
help

221
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:08,029
with only a a normal permissions

222
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:12,279
and they can't compromise users
permissions so if that the case then we

223
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:13,689
have to look at these

224
00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:19,060
broadcast receivers and see how
developers are using them

225
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,180
and we need to help the users to the

226
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,850
be more aware all these broadcast
receivers

227
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:29,339
whenever the try to install download and
install

228
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:32,720
and and applications from the market so
far this

229
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,899
we a we've done we are working now and
pearl

230
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:39,949
into products the first thing is to to
build an app

231
00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:43,079
party out that help the user

232
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:46,079
visualize these broadcast receivers so

233
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,990
now offering is a dedication he can see
which application is

234
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,649
accident and also we need his help with
trying to help them

235
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:56,750
but at the same time we tried to help
ourselves

236
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:01,370
by collecting this information ones and
if we know which applications is you

237
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,509
is what is using what broadcast
receivers

238
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:08,259
weekend a made some conclusions on

239
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:11,370
that some partners receive alerts are
some applications

240
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:15,910
it's normal for from them it's an odd
behavior from them to ask for certain

241
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:19,850
a broadcast receivers and also we asked
them to

242
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:23,329
give their opinion about how the feel
about

243
00:15:23,329 --> 00:15:28,329
this application accident this broadcast
actions

244
00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:32,759
and in the second project we tried to
change the plan the entire platform

245
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:36,079
in a way that we changed the way we
display

246
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,279
the the permissions at the have you seen

247
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,939
her as you have seen and the first slide
day classifying the permissions

248
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:47,389
and too dangerous and normal what we

249
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:50,999
here we found that the normal can be
dangerous

250
00:15:50,999 --> 00:15:54,779
if there's a broadcast receivers in this
less if the occasion

251
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:58,610
has to be revisited again an they can
effect on

252
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:03,220
disciplining this permissions and the
first

253
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:07,060
so mister dove help having esta a static

254
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,620
classification of permissions we can do
with on

255
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,430
a runtime when we'd read the manifest up

256
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:17,870
each Android application and then we
disobey this

257
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:21,339
basin our dynamic classifications for
this but missions

258
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:25,569
and see how users act and how users

259
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:30,899
in click on these a Wenders

260
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:34,730
so besides there are we found also there
are multiple

261
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:38,749
issues no another two issues with
broadcast actions

262
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:42,850
in enjoyed the first thing is the
conflict

263
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:46,139
a stunning from get like it can't virgin

264
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:50,199
sometimes there is a a conflict between
third-party applications

265
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:54,550
if to applications register to listen to
a particular

266
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:57,910
action it's a SMS receipt

267
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:01,160
then application is just that there's
then

268
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,829
and and then obligation be adjusted
again to receive also

269
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:09,230
or to listen to SMS received action

270
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,870
so a can't deny be from accessing

271
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:16,839
the SMS and so this is we need also to

272
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,470
help the developers by grouping all the

273
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,880
broadcast actions and see what

274
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,679
broadcast can be a can't close

275
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,710
a conflict between different
applications so because the developers

276
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:35,010
the know that when I we install an
application it should work

277
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:38,390
they should register protest actions and
it should work fine

278
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:42,590
but we have to help the developers by
detecting these companies if there's a

279
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:46,640
a conflict happening on the n2 device we
have to inform

280
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,450
the developer of this conflict

281
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:54,679
a third thing is that the battery life
when you have an application that is an

282
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:57,779
adjuster to listen to whatever

283
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:01,159
whatever action happens in the enjoyed a
brain system

284
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:04,799
this will cause trigger the application
multiple times

285
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:09,090
into excusing code in the and the and
the back and the back

286
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:12,380
which causes which a cause the it
raining

287
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,059
the the batter

288
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:19,520
so we just we grouped all the the a it

289
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,929
the broadcast actions sins and

290
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:26,360
since the the first release enjoyed and

291
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,360
this to help us visualize and to help us

292
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,669
missile conflicts

293
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:37,090
and the words changing the enjoy the
platform

294
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:41,760
we've done with what we've done like a
minor modification so far and we can

295
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,270
finally

296
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:45,549
and we got a new image we added some
system perhaps

297
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:50,110
enter the these imagines and now we are
investigating how to change

298
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:53,990
the package installer to change the way
we display

299
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:58,529
permissions dynamic in

300
00:18:58,529 --> 00:19:01,980
so and my a did the conclusion of my

301
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:06,900
talk is we said that not their missions
we ask the questions if known

302
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,320
emissions can cause I'll can compromise
uses the privacy

303
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,850
alone and towards achieving that we
investigated

304
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:17,309
the other components a fear these
applications which are the activities

305
00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:18,600
broadcast receivers

306
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,919
under the provider and services

307
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,120
and we found that the broadcast
receivers are guilty so

308
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,929
peekskill them and so we did more
investigation

309
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:32,980
and do that and we found that

310
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,490
the broadcast receivers are causing that

311
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:39,779
trouble so we did more investigation
into that

312
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:42,929
and decides we bill we r into the prices
of

313
00:19:42,929 --> 00:19:46,500
finishing they have that will detect
conflicts

314
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:52,260
and also to increase users awareness and
also changing the injury platform

315
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,510
to dynamically classifying the
permissions and this

316
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:59,020
