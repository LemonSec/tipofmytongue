1
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,910
you know ok silent silence on the menu

2
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:32,390
which now fire I so saying a word fire
as

3
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,990
three years doing more security research
tool development

4
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,720
that's where they were overjoyed

5
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,610
which is basically a now school to help
me do

6
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:47,910
assessments word oxide and I get

7
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,739
your small tools for people down

8
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:58,490
with my twitter handles on there but so
what talk is now

9
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,980
its stock is not daughter an open source
project

10
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,070
the presentation yesterday but broadcast
receivers

11
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,850
interesting talk about your sourcing
discuss

12
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,020
there it's also not introduction

13
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:15,340
and reassessment so we're not gonna talk
about how to use

14
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:19,950
educate or box mood think it's awkward

15
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,229
soon we all know that we can reverse
applications modify applications

16
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:27,569
for all the other things we needed all
see

17
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:31,920
if we need to look at eyes do you know
where we're not gonna look at

18
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,170
any armor assembly was gonna see people

19
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,740
right as what the stock is

20
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,380
is or and determine where and what to
look for

21
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,679
for changes at the Orleans make rendered
in

22
00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:51,289
going with the further we talk about
where and how much is able

23
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:55,500
miss users can exploit these poorly
implemented features

24
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,310
that's a lot of times not exactly more
secure you think about it is all these

25
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:03,759
devices out there market I and they're
all trying to be unique

26
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,979
way but they're all starting from the
same code base so

27
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:10,410
simply as the tracks that HTC phone

28
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,940
but the way they implement future may
not be the best

29
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,930
way dude will also be the general
exploration

30
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:22,270
Android platform security which I feel
like bit underrated

31
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:25,480
oxide just application security but not
a whole lot

32
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,620
platform security in general so my
motivations or this is

33
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,549
when I started doing this testing
devices I couldn't really find any

34
00:02:34,549 --> 00:02:38,129
I'm you're learning at antacid

35
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:42,170
forensics you go online to buy book blog
sites

36
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,799
you have a pretty good any start I was
kinda in the dark I could really find

37
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:46,310
any

38
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:51,159
you know guide this great information

39
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:55,099
texted developers but it's not really
geared toward doing the Securities

40
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:58,689
more like how to root your phone cycle

41
00:02:58,689 --> 00:03:01,769
habits not organized I could use

42
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:05,670
actually do it says the also really

43
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:09,370
free tools for us to use there's the
only thing I can do you think that comes

44
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,469
from all the closes

45
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:14,319
Joes are pros from WR but thats

46
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,760
paper products in that something by

47
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,219
in the basement to answer the question
morning and you

48
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:24,420
and you were the mall abilities

49
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,620
device you know where to look for the
issues

50
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:33,670
and what you use actually by somebody
issued

51
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,870
here scandalous year so information is
both

52
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,500
they want basically is a malicious user
or malicious application

53
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,859
able to obtain information about the use
or device using some terrible

54
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:51,349
is the user able to you or application
able that's what people did

55
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:57,900
this is where developers ok are we able
through these devices also

56
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,280
now serves as a possible for malicious
user to create an application

57
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,609
exploit some issue in a particular
device that would

58
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:11,060
render them device use or so

59
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,549
Recep talking about the where where to
look what kinda broke down

60
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:18,639
by like so we're gonna start

61
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,960
will set up with assume that some
enhance your phone

62
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,650
and this is not a phone stolen or
something no lock screen

63
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:32,300
you have USB debugging turned on you
have a test lab setup with eighty

64
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,910
bridge that up and let's assume this
phone is not rooted

65
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,590
you'd be surprised how powerful the
shell user is

66
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:43,260
entered very much all the control you
need

67
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,270
except running through which is which is
good for

68
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:52,360
devices orders over looking at
application so applications are pretty

69
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:52,680
big

70
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,640
component device if you think about it
the new

71
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,650
Galaxy S five comes with 37 Android
application

72
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:04,170
a party in at 291 application

73
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:07,840
hard Sams the carriers

74
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,260
thats a lot about Asian

75
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,420
you think about others one of those has
some sort of issue

76
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,030
so we look at the components we have

77
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:22,990
activities Richard dialer application

78
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,870
much bad service which runs in the
background you think

79
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:30,430
Twitter updater every half an hour we

80
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,890
content provider which is basically a
database

81
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,890
information sharing mechanism

82
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:40,130
a broadcast receiver which was talked
about yesterday this

83
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:44,630
listener for some sort of a good example
this one is

84
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,190
an SMS message from then rocket
receivers out

85
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:52,030
a a completed

86
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,210
others also need lifers model later bit

87
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:59,360
user C libraries give you the ability to
in Iraq

88
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,540
Seco from

89
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:06,440
so components can be export that mean

90
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,960
strength dinner is that you can
basically Expo which one another

91
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,740
application

92
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,120
iraq creates a very unique user
experience

93
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,120
in a large do things like creative
messaging application

94
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,790
such that when a message comes in in
phone number you click on the phone

95
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,320
number

96
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,530
to launch the dialer phone a nice
experience

97
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:26,760
the way that accomplishes by exporting
the dialer Asian

98
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,990
so that other applications and in Iraq

99
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,710
has to be done explicitly by saying I
want to export this particular

100
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:38,340
component or we don't implicitly by
mistaking Lee exporting

101
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,440
so for example if the application is
marked the Bible

102
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,340
everything or if there's an intense of
the present

103
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,450
which is usually its way filter

104
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,430
messages or automatically exported
regardless if he said

105
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:56,600
and it in the documentation overlook

106
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,920
so it was born to be careful what you
export you can really affect the

107
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,720
security model

108
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,760
application by exporting rock opponents

109
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,860
so your should use permit submissions

110
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,080
our mechanism provided by Android so you
can basically say

111
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,150
habits can and I want you to possess
mission

112
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,190
acts why field in Iraq

113
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:19,350
so there's already hundreds missions the
fine by is our

114
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:22,360
at all or operating system for example

115
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,850
receive SMS you need to possess that
mission

116
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,860
in order for the system to consider
sending miss

117
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,940
broadcast receiver you and he's our

118
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:35,760
applied on in they provided

119
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,210
order levels protection

120
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:43,440
the first one is normally really nothing
releases a

121
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,050
as a placeholder mean anything the any
permission

122
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,200
with normal any other application

123
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,300
so by saying it's no we're not really
doing it

124
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,000
the dangers would be anyone can request
however when they

125
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,020
user installs an application dangers
mission it's going to warn the user

126
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,860
a this missions being this is something
like

127
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,770
reading your contacts sending text
dangerous missions

128
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:12,490
and the final two are basically
restricted permission these are things

129
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,530
that the

130
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:17,180
the OEM's should be using for all their
system

131
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,230
basically saying you need to be a system
application

132
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,320
or need to be signed by the signature

133
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,430
the plot so anything that was bill

134
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:30,240
device was bill use these permissions
and no third party applications should

135
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,460
be ok

136
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,700
you be surprised what people actually
use soloman is gonna go through

137
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,399
you to these components show you how be
a we can dismiss you

138
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,250
Thomas R with activities the first one
was that are usually these

139
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:48,630
less critical you know you're not going
to find an expose activity it's gonna

140
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:52,459
ruin your day sometimes you do sometimes
a fine

141
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:55,690
for example parental control Asian where

142
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,640
launch the application it'll display
medication box

143
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,280
and when you put the correct potentials
in to launch another activity

144
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,940
or if they export the activity that's
behind the authentication

145
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,980
completely bypasses check even is
directly launch that

146
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:16,440
your own again but my mail you see
things like the fucking screens in

147
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,920
Simon example you can see is a mission
by here

148
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,510
secret code I mean we see activity with
that misapplied

149
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,700
so it looks like doing things right as I
mentioned

150
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,130
for there's no protection too soon to be
a normal

151
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:35,590
so this permission doing up same a

152
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:39,230
required uses and

153
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,510
secure code i Mees special dialer

154
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:46,720
additional privileges

155
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,870
its services the same thing a lot of
time to seal

156
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:53,010
authentication services aerial
credentials

157
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,430
token and return Okanagan session ID

158
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:01,080
or sometimes with the things reforms
sensitive activity back

159
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,510
should be 10

160
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,790
ordered you could called you I service

161
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:12,090
not

162
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:15,810
or the one below is all you next all

163
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:19,070
the contrast exporter

164
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:23,110
budgeting XP chat service

165
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:27,610
expose providers these are real big one
you'd be surprised how many

166
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,960
applications databases out missions
orders

167
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,170
wrong examples right here

168
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:39,140
provider name parental control settings
TV helper

169
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,540
it's pretty obvious but I think and this
one has the right

170
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,640
so you can under you can specify read

171
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,190
and right mission this one shows happen
re permission

172
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,140
so any application can read them and for
write permission me

173
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,860
and red mission right settings again
this looks good

174
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,360
but the issue is right settings dangers
mission

175
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,029
which means that when you requests
permission gonna say

176
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:07,160
hey this application wants to you using
mission

177
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,310
but it's not going to stop a malicious
user from installing

178
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:13,880
application West right settings

179
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,000
you can only imagine what would happen
if you install the application right

180
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,640
settings

181
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,050
rental activity much in

182
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:24,279
security in work on

183
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:27,500
broadcast receivers I'd

184
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,510
secret oversee he's a president all

185
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:33,740
devices basically it's a special 10

186
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:37,210
for receiver that when you dial specific

187
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:41,650
code sequence dialer application its
gonna Senate whoever's listening

188
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:46,660
so you what should I learned star power
star pound

189
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,880
90 start OnStar it's likely gonna

190
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,570
send a receiver to here

191
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:58,590
which is going to launch some activity
art service or do something

192
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:02,460
and devices can have anywhere from 10 to
100 these

193
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,110
receivers that are basically the back
door application

194
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:09,390
this particular one here mission which
is good

195
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:12,940
and this permission is actually system
or signature only mission

196
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,270
however the OEM's for that when you

197
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:20,750
sign it into the dialer in the users
using the dialer application

198
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:25,230
ok these it doesn't matter you can all
because you.re

199
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:31,180
as you build

200
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,690
any

201
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,900
so moving on revocation framework

202
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,070
so if you're developing applications you
know those

203
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:45,350
large API all use sold they have to be
installed

204
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:48,710
somewhere is on the framework visible
the API's

205
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:52,529
program as well resource use

206
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:55,950
so volumes are free to add whatever they
want here

207
00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:00,290
resources widgets classes whatever

208
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:03,339
in these are gonna be loaded up cycle

209
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:07,089
boo and as I go to basically special
cents on the dollar

210
00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:10,100
urgency that every time a nap issue 1
start

211
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,550
or saw fidel seen and everything loaded
and ready to go

212
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:17,140
its performance opposition Android
exists only watch

213
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:21,839
application load so it does that by
reading the book last

214
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,220
very set you'd you can see ollie

215
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,580
jar here

216
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:32,320
that are all loaded every virtual
machine

217
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,470
so I would say about happen these here

218
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:39,620
actually the end and the other half are
just

219
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:43,610
oh %um so if you were to pick here what
is

220
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:48,130
on I'm a sinner what is the QC media
what are these calls

221
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,460
in Collier and a

222
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,339
what you want to do is use explore each
these API see within

223
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:59,010
in a Wii likely gonna have to do is free
like a fake application

224
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:02,279
clips and then disassemble

225
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:05,800
write your own small a clip gonna
complain know about

226
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,200
guys answer not actually part Android 12
goals I wanna work on

227
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,170
actually rebuild jar so you can use
these API's

228
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,220
as if you were a under so

229
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,580
you're developing against guys have them
there

230
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:24,529
and you could use a read seek review

231
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:27,839
wide available every application phone

232
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,580
right i'd here

233
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,850
used you see things like this that every
application could read if they knew

234
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:35,700
about

235
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,890
in the world there some other things in
the 800

236
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:45,460
system services so the new Samsung
Galaxy S five

237
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,839
there's about seventy and racist
services

238
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:52,180
and there's about 50 Samsung more

239
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:56,460
oh %um system services it seems like an
aggressive number system services

240
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:00,370
addition whatever's I need to be
anything from

241
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:03,640
you know controlling to having their own
stand-alone

242
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:07,040
properties and a wide Williams one
another

243
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,640
properties classes already all and
properties their

244
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,350
secure is also file

245
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:17,730
platform that XML which is stored on the
system partition

246
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,850
biscuits a mapping to this

247
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:24,490
two different things mission a group ID
matching so

248
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,610
but people don't realize when you
request internet mission

249
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:30,690
all it's doing is adding you to the
group

250
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,730
and the group i net is allowed create
sockets

251
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:36,980
and the regular group your side Asian
now

252
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,990
sockets on you try to access the
internet

253
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:44,230
the group i net you fail the cycle

254
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:48,000
in there's also additional mappings

255
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,810
pressure mapping group so you could say

256
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:55,320
if you are in the group shell which is

257
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,450
user you get the missions said

258
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:02,250
and the OEM's are free to have whatever
they want you another use disclaimer in

259
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,410
the pilot says

260
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:07,470
be extremely careful where you at

261
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:11,160
interesting there's all kinds of stuff
fine new group

262
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:16,279
new mission group think you'd

263
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:19,600
log buffers another early one by Paul

264
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,100
you log buffers I'd

265
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,130
wanna you can use most often use the log
classic

266
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:29,149
Asian the main log here

267
00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:33,360
say rules

268
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,070
shop in the main buffered here but the

269
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:40,520
example here like him but there's

270
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,020
this here that are

271
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:47,110
logger their with in me

272
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:51,580
why using allied

273
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:55,020
leaving North the group

274
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:59,050
same log you you want to realize they
have to do is being a logger

275
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:05,029
then you can read all them and
allometric

276
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:08,419
system binaries again this the dump

277
00:17:08,419 --> 00:17:13,740
5 I think this 81 system binaries that
the OEM

278
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,110
somebody's shell scripts more arms
ERATION files

279
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:21,020
and they're all the in the directory
system bins

280
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,750
so going through these you can
understand a lot about where

281
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:28,529
the where specific files that you would
reacts to

282
00:17:28,529 --> 00:17:32,080
soul directories on system drive looking
at these

283
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,960
ministries you learn a lot about the

284
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,429
pop specific he's only

285
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:43,159
require running see all these
commissioners and things

286
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:46,690
breaking but it does help you can
understand them changed

287
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,739
made system

288
00:17:49,739 --> 00:17:52,840
going along great with that native
libraries mention this

289
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:57,070
this was part of and revocation we can
also have system libraries

290
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,850
phone i think is about 400 in

291
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:04,119
Billy Beane think at this point

292
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:08,769
in these are just share libras so while
basically

293
00:18:08,769 --> 00:18:12,049
someone who have referred to as the Jan

294
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:15,149
which the Java native interface which
allows and applications

295
00:18:15,149 --> 00:18:18,279
write code in Java which talk to the C
code to do

296
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:21,480
lower-level functionality and it's
interesting to note that

297
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,470
all share libraries unless explicitly
you can be read by any

298
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:29,129
Asian soul you have some sort of shared
library call

299
00:18:29,129 --> 00:18:32,940
generate secret so an alt returns

300
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,139
okay any application technically read

301
00:18:36,139 --> 00:18:40,779
that library interact with

302
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:45,259
and this becomes more been issue when
share library does any sort of device

303
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:46,489
driver

304
00:18:46,489 --> 00:18:49,970
as if it doesn't right driver no word

305
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,259
us it is an example here running

306
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:56,470
man all

307
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:00,309
particular wanna or last name

308
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:04,489
will show you that those are functions
that are exposed to job

309
00:19:04,489 --> 00:19:07,850
you also see that import all Sasaki

310
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:12,450
here which is basically saying that you
came inside

311
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:15,470
this is actually how one the new HTC

312
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:18,549
owes

313
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:23,659
library that held all that would be let
you do things as the colonel

314
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:26,779
and application

315
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:30,190
terrible

316
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,549
so now talking about the where

317
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:36,749
word about toward created

318
00:19:36,749 --> 00:19:40,210
to make a little bit you I mention there
wasn't really anything

319
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:44,340
I that was gonna help me army help me
dude

320
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,679
have a new divide quickly I thought
about this device

321
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,039
framework yeah that just helps me

322
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,269
you devices

323
00:19:55,269 --> 00:19:58,279
religious on from all these scripts

324
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:01,350
Python scripts Bastrop C code

325
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:05,279
obvious young Bangalore together in
framework

326
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:08,669
model-based approach basically

327
00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:12,919
top to go through to the things I talk
about and give me some results looking

328
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:17,610
so I want to know have this device i won
all the new system

329
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,830
I wanna know all the new

330
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:24,149
all analog from there I can use all

331
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:30,200
reverse engineering have available to
find issues

332
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,049
so it it by itself not really that
exciting you think about

333
00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:37,090
Metasploit Metasploit by itself is
really

334
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:40,239
citing its it's the modules that come
with

335
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,739
corporate powerful a minute religiously
command line

336
00:20:43,739 --> 00:20:47,470
cool argued the computer have the same
thing

337
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:51,340
basically has a configuration files for
your device

338
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:54,730
has like a package installer models or
and then

339
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:58,940
there's much modules or we're doing
exciting

340
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,169
some all about the model phases

341
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:09,169
which define much you think if any
assessment basically data collection

342
00:21:09,379 --> 00:21:13,869
processing intended so in a data
collection phase

343
00:21:13,869 --> 00:21:16,980
with the collecting piled up like
Interpol

344
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:21,190
setup your project we have these
particular man

345
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:24,509
all yep you could essentially

346
00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:28,190
chain together of all these think I'm
back in happen our

347
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:33,379
you can have all the system applications
frameworks liners system libraries

348
00:21:33,379 --> 00:21:36,730
mission files all stored locally

349
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:41,019
for you to you later with nothing to say
yet

350
00:21:41,019 --> 00:21:45,359
but there was a problem so we have a
model that on packs all our framework

351
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:49,429
files so this fall but the framework
database and also on packed them all the

352
00:21:49,429 --> 00:21:50,070
directories

353
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:54,480
so that we can us are analyzing same
thing with system

354
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,350
its gonna try to unpack I guess in the
case s5 290 applications in addition to

355
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,419
the regular ones

356
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:03,980
and its gonna put them all on
directories rename the moment for us

357
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:08,609
so that we can actually playing and then
the real fun part is going to create

358
00:22:08,609 --> 00:22:09,409
databases

359
00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:13,629
everything Eric it's getting all those
applications as basic unlike index

360
00:22:13,629 --> 00:22:16,970
gonna go through all them it's given all
the riders

361
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:20,080
services receivers activities

362
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,100
share libraries in the database it's
gonna the permissions annotated

363
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:29,210
use mission it's getting all the tax
code it's getting that's all those gonna

364
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:30,049
go through it

365
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:33,080
lot all last names names super although

366
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,609
those anything devices

367
00:22:36,609 --> 00:22:40,149
this answers so now what comes

368
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:43,899
announces I basically on this

369
00:22:43,899 --> 00:22:47,119
previous two steps for all versions

370
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:52,100
I haven't budget director setup an
ninety

371
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,700
with all these databases read level and
then I can say

372
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:00,609
okay new phone running and I have all
these databases that are basically

373
00:23:00,609 --> 00:23:05,190
meta-data API and I have my new device
here

374
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:09,480
I wanna do you think I want to know all
the new devices

375
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,710
saw lloyd yep its gonna print all the
new devices

376
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:18,710
phone with live online you can show ones
that are exposed

377
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:22,309
readable everyone such you can do this

378
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:27,220
much everything you could say i learn
all the new application

379
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,239
install run

380
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:33,679
violent both say okay i CLD

381
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,759
you could say I wanna see all the new
framework

382
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:41,809
framework simple

383
00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:45,109
so a lot on my testing starts running
all these

384
00:23:45,109 --> 00:23:49,019
and he creates a blotter lead things
look into its not gonna really find any

385
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:52,119
all abilities yet was gonna give you
with all the things that you should be

386
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:52,470
at least

387
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:56,100
looking into

388
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:00,779
besides dipping is also the whole
looking for exposure

389
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:03,919
this model basically just look for real
files

390
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,929
miles writeable what percent you ID
files

391
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:10,619
those are you know go to any

392
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:14,229
group will search for all applications
are installed a long track

393
00:24:14,229 --> 00:24:17,609
activity Waptrick basically like so

394
00:24:17,609 --> 00:24:21,090
I said there's two hundred ninety-one
applications on the same side

395
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:24,999
I can guarantee more that happen them
don't even icon

396
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:28,220
you never even see them because they're

397
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:32,090
right now all on launcher which you
should look into those

398
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:38,779
because they might be bugging might this
be sensitive while even there

399
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:42,379
you can also travel meta-data if

400
00:24:42,379 --> 00:24:46,019
keys

401
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:50,019
then my favorite running the generators
here

402
00:24:50,019 --> 00:24:54,259
has won all those gonna give you see is
the all the expos

403
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:57,539
secret codes aided by the level nations
any exposed

404
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:01,289
activities services provider Sears you
can still owes an Excel

405
00:25:01,289 --> 00:25:04,690
and then start going to make a check to
launch this one

406
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:07,769
and it looks like it's a admits

407
00:25:07,769 --> 00:25:11,080
in in menu

408
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,669
this one is just a your

409
00:25:14,669 --> 00:25:17,690
I would you go through those and it's
all that you need this is the worst

410
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:21,850
easy for me filter and sort

411
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:25,549
and then in general there's some
general-purpose things that I

412
00:25:25,549 --> 00:25:32,549
israel's scripts that I had you know 1

413
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:43,020
so yep 28 you can do in the dollar

414
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:46,700
yes really all that is

415
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,970
probably so you can use

416
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:53,440
the secret code mandate year to make
them

417
00:25:53,440 --> 00:26:00,440
you can skip to rate

418
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:08,150
right so basically Seaford this
particular is just in 10

419
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:12,570
reader you give it a number dollar you
could

420
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:19,570
setup goes through them dial 1

421
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:29,450
I use yeah I use likud

422
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:32,980
eventually I wanna I'd

423
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:37,570
hereby no

424
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:41,470
so really the only thing that i'd day
than

425
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:46,360
today you want you'd appealing

426
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:50,890
most stuff is offline data collection
phase again

427
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:55,510
everything you need so you can but saw
locally

428
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:58,730
excellence based locally then you could
on on your phone

429
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:03,870
tolerated doing 31 you on one side

430
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:08,020
the idea everything locally

431
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:11,330
you don't need to you phony

432
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:15,400
not yet

433
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,720
measurement so right now still pretty

434
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,460
for me it's always different things when
I

435
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:25,600
you feel stable yep

436
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,880
my goal is today

437
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,680
yes it will be a minute

438
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:40,570
but so

439
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:43,710
I use the emulator to

440
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:46,910
build the database is be entering data
bases

441
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:50,790
so that's why use like baseline

442
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:54,340
each like I anywhere one 19

443
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:58,260
that's what I use decreed so I mean you
could

444
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,820
but is if you're asking if you could
install

445
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:08,820
mister on the emulator we're asking

446
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,830
I mean you might be able to you later I
mean

447
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:23,150
her lines up everything directly there
you probably need religious to get

448
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,290
everything you need of

449
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:27,620
Burlington work I'm sure it's possible

450
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:31,240
is running just and might be more

451
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:38,110
trouble than it's worth its image okay

452
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:44,400
so businesses man's the one alright
bring up sure library

453
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,420
11 its looks for Jane here

454
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:50,600
libraries device interaction

455
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,430
run that across all share libraries
actually

456
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:58,480
they're looking these if im

457
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:04,260
import socket or import I'll control
parts something in the Deaf directory

458
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:08,140
has g'night like that that bad you can
actually

459
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:13,860
driver rollicking new app

460
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,030
thing one download him guys

461
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:24,030
by new framework API GK using eclipse
know about you can use this new app

462
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:24,780
wanted

463
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:29,000
reports of a new application with make
files they make me clean

464
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,190
on and then you can just writing in
somali

465
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:36,440
and is build make everything you if you

466
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:43,440
like on the classic because you have
everything in databases

467
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:46,700
winning tax and all year you can

468
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:51,440
you bastard by Nick no and
rate-sensitive

469
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,440
anyone know what pilots actually you
could search

470
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:59,130
comin file only takes second or running

471
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:03,410
man's morning files quick way to

472
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:10,200
in this particular framework in this to
some closing thoughts

473
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,230
earlier done to me it seems like the
OEM's the carriers

474
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:17,450
them a lot its these issues are like
ninety nine nights

475
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:21,380
they're not like memory corruption like
this breezy

476
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:25,770
hack things I dislike things exposed

477
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:29,810
their I think it's just the fact that
there's really no tools other

478
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:34,270
that they're not being given the right
tools such as

479
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:37,650
think chemistry it becomes extremely
what's

480
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:41,770
with exposed and I mean I've been doing
my best think

481
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:46,370
bill argue this area there's a lot of
things

482
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:52,450
learn about just be careful mistrust
when you'd

483
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:56,679
runner-up Asian each other on security

484
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:03,679
any questions

485
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:17,870
now

486
00:31:54,809 --> 00:32:01,809
yeah you're not alone

487
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,870
yet I'm particular

488
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:09,000
works but there are a lot of methods

489
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,050
do that there was only iowa's

490
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:15,730
mobile substrate looking

491
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:18,790
framework objective-c that was ported
over

492
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:23,260
Android required phone obviously
basically dollar machine

493
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:26,830
loads up your application it'll robots
in you can

494
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:30,030
a function point and it could be doing
something like that

495
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:33,970
it starts look mission

496
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:37,280
or you can modify the package solar

497
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,350
which I think mentioned yesterday you
can modify that

498
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:43,809
you look at the mission requesting in
rewrite things

499
00:32:43,809 --> 00:32:47,050
I mean is all kind of thing you 13 group
I mean

500
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:51,790
guide rewrite system you can use that

501
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:57,280
thats that's like I think ninety percent
right original

502
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:01,530
you can't say know I'd it's like

503
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:08,530
it is a pretty big concern

504
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,120
I the

505
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:21,030
in there's definitely some I'd

506
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:24,220
next IMAX it's going to be

507
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:28,750
last loaded then years

508
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:32,490
but they're is still sure some changes

509
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:36,910
if it was just stock Android might
actually be

510
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:43,910
attitude them

511
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:04,820
you say what security permitting

512
00:34:07,309 --> 00:34:08,960
where there's sharell everyone's

513
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,210
it's not like issue which is something

514
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:16,490
expert they

515
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:20,599
a wide jelly bean

516
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:25,079
had in

517
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:28,399
me strip

518
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,440
that was design I think you

519
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,409
it was a tonight mission 100

520
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:38,490
3

521
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:42,369
I haven't seen any there are

522
00:34:42,369 --> 00:34:47,829
haven't seen any all

523
00:34:47,829 --> 00:34:51,529
Syrians be a little bit stronger one
thing I

524
00:34:51,529 --> 00:34:54,679
heard from the new

525
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:58,079
bird call is going to prevent execution

526
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,339
data partition which will impact the way
I'm getting

527
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:07,869
basically you can you can text really
anywhere else emitted used to go back

528
00:35:07,869 --> 00:35:11,420
directory directory

529
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:15,990
when in SD card now that's all been
disabled

530
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:20,880
and their answering data very hard

531
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,769
man's as different users and is also

532
00:35:25,769 --> 00:35:29,819
actually one thing there's so there is
that

533
00:35:29,819 --> 00:35:33,990
model something like this

534
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:40,609
forcing but that was being

535
00:35:40,609 --> 00:35:44,029
make

536
00:35:44,029 --> 00:35:47,849
you access using

537
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:54,849
any other

538
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,950
I don't think so I mean

539
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:11,340
there there really isn't any aid

540
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:16,310
beside them claim to make your day more
secure

541
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:23,310
and I like box I'm actually actually

542
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:33,090
you somebody said yet it's

543
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:37,640
its as an application you can do last
thing you can

544
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:42,070
Milanese almost applications several
ways

545
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:46,430
that they're able to do all these things
being

546
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:50,290
around pretty

547
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:57,290
curious to see how they're doing see but
I have ever seen play with any

548
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:42,560
so okay 1

549
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:10,250
actually did see pigeon work with
greater

550
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:13,720
fix that wanna be changing now

551
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,940
have all messaging app so all the

552
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:21,350
vendors even third-party having haps
replaced

553
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:24,850
so they've opened up this whole
messaging

554
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:30,120
development opportunity what the issue
the airport actually was

555
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,950
it was new app that was meant to be
installed

556
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:37,920
Newark is and it had a service

557
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,020
that was protected with mission that
didn't exist

558
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:44,280
previous version so kick

559
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,370
if you install this application any
device prior

560
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:51,780
because mission didn't actually exist
operating system you can still say

561
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:56,430
hey you needed but systems like even
know that is

562
00:38:56,430 --> 00:39:00,750
in so if you were dis- malicious
application you could say

563
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:04,030
hate I'm going to find them and I like
taxes

564
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:07,060
and i wanna talk that service and you
could send

565
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:11,580
so like the does exist its

566
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:15,260
it's interesting moving mod trusting do
things like this

567
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:19,350
and there's the change was two lines ago

568
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:22,530
check the API it is

569
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:29,530
and today

570
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:43,940
yeah so what I wanted DAP

571
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:47,900
tools out there model I think I do wanna

572
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:51,810
some sort methodology for one

573
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:55,980
I like but also the shares basically

574
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:59,460
the slide and a walk

575
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:06,460
things that I useful doing it to test
cases my being

576
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:12,250
it was a thought that crossed my mind
appeased

577
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:16,190
for me would be to build my own version
and breaking

578
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:20,300
thing if you will you can there

579
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:24,420
I mean it's wide your ideal

580
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:29,230
example anyway exploding

581
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:36,230
now

582
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:51,510
well there's a there's a initially when
I

583
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:56,270
reportedly Bible I really wanted to do

584
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:59,600
like old specific examples

585
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,750
this device in all the issues there so I
started

586
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:07,800
process or even up

587
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:12,320
and I said like these are all series
privilege escalation

588
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:19,110
missions vixen think it for you perfect
here it is

589
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:23,050
June pics wanna like talk about here

590
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:26,580
sometimes they're really build sometimes
there

591
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:31,020
like yeah working tickets but six months

592
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:34,470
eventually public its

593
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:37,710
sometimes really very about

594
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:44,710
with any questions i'll be

595
00:42:06,269 --> 00:42:06,650
another

596
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:12,910
I haven't seen any

597
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:19,219
there has been some abilities up

598
00:42:19,219 --> 00:42:22,229
its issue

599
00:42:22,229 --> 00:42:27,170
I haven't

600
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:34,170
haven't seen any documented

601
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:42,779
we'll have any questions thanks
