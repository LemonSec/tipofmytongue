1
00:00:06,669 --> 00:00:07,149
thank you

2
00:00:07,149 --> 00:00:10,350
and thank you for not playing single
ladies as you threatened

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:16,000
I

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,020
yeah I am perennially known as Beyonce
in my household which is oh it's

5
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:21,560
troubling

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,460
anyway onto the top sell for today

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,330
thank you vic for mentioning the
disclaimer today's presentation is based

8
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:29,840
off a

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,610
research that was funded by nice by

10
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:38,230
K by V National Institute of Justice

11
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,739
a with the large study in so I'm in a
present today are some other

12
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:45,480
preliminary findings from different
aspects that study but the rationale for

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:45,830
it

14
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:49,760
wasn't trying to understand how stolen
data markets are similar to

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,280
were different from traditional real
world markets for stolen products

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,100
leave you ever had a laptop stolen or
you know back in the days when VCR's

17
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,619
were plentiful in popular

18
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:03,869
electronics a stoner jewelry and how
much that material goes for

19
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:07,119
and then in addition to that we're
trying to understand how these markets

20
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,350
are organized so the extent to which
they're driven by

21
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,830
lone actors people working in loose
affiliation with one another

22
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,049
or are these really complex organized
crime groups like we might think I've in

23
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:19,299
terms of the Mafia

24
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:23,899
or the Yakuza or something like that so
the title for today comparing apples

25
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:24,700
lemons

26
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:30,000
is part love the attempt on our part to
understand how the economics this market

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,590
work

28
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,109
and to what extent the community for
stone

29
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:37,200
data is driven by people selling good
data

30
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,499
and bad day and the rationale for this
study really began

31
00:01:41,499 --> 00:01:45,640
in part from the massive number breaches
that have occurred over the last couple

32
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,310
years

33
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,310
and when we talk about breaches

34
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:53,079
often the most interesting thing is
trying to understand when and how the

35
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,069
breach happens

36
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:58,399
so you might remember in November last
year we had huge target preach where

37
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,659
you know seventy million depending on
whose estimates you look at

38
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:05,630
cards were stolen well interestingly my
daughter was born

39
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:09,340
in November and as a result in the
target breach

40
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,500
both my credit cards from my two primary
institutions that are my debit cards

41
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,670
had to be replaced and then a credit
card all because I was shopping at

42
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,120
Target during that time

43
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,160
by her diapers and formula and all that
other fun stuff my wife recently bought

44
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,310
baby leg warmers so that way we can
replicate flashdance I guess

45
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,880
and as a result her credit card got
stolen because the

46
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,160
baby you leg warmers dot com website is
not very secure

47
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,280
and apparently several hundred thousand

48
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,820
young mothers all buying products there
were able to get swindled for about ten

49
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,700
or fifteen dollars a piece by somebody

50
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,890
getting data from that point cell in the
last six months

51
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:55,400
we've lost four different cards in my
house which is just

52
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,170
amazing I've never had that much data go
away and

53
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,200
this short amount of time and I don't
know if any have you are crafting folks

54
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,830
out there

55
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:08,680
but michael's just got breached the
company that sells various

56
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,990
you know crafting items and whatnot so
if you're buying your thread or your

57
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,860
string or your buttons or whatever else

58
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,010
you might have lost eight so there's

59
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:20,430
a ton have breaches but the question is
what do you do

60
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,470
with that data what are bad guys doing

61
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,570
once they get several million credit
card numbers well there's a good body

62
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,430
research that's out there from computer
science from

63
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,460
criminological studies most about
looking at

64
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:37,560
the process of buying and selling
information so a lot of these markets

65
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,650
at least preliminarily were examined
through IRC

66
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,580
but there's a substantial number two
that have started looking at four

67
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,610
because forums for whatever reason are

68
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,720
a popular medium in which you can buy
date

69
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,030
and as a result we understand how people

70
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:56,130
engage in the process is selling its
advertising driven people can provide a

71
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,350
little bit of feedback

72
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,540
but beyond that we don't really
understand much about the

73
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,490
economics at this marketplace very very
few people have actually tried

74
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:08,460
estimate how much money somebody makes
by buying stolen data

75
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:13,220
or alternatively how much these products
cost in fact the only two studies that

76
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,630
have ever provided estimates

77
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,259
one I did with a grad student UNC
Charlotte

78
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:21,739
and another one that looked at

79
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:25,440
a estimates based author data from
Symantec

80
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,860
so there's very few people who've
actually tried provide us with any kinda

81
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,430
figures is how much it costs enter this
market

82
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,590
or what goes on there so as I mentioned
earlier that's the entire purpose

83
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,810
this study what are the costs for goods
and services like

84
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:42,129
how much does this particular market
place

85
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:45,319
impact are actually economy and to what
extent

86
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:49,129
do individuals engaging in this
community have their own internal

87
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:52,879
processes that affect how much you might
be able to advertise a product for

88
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:56,069
these secondary questions are things
that I might get into a little bit today

89
00:04:56,069 --> 00:04:58,780
particularly the social organization at
the market

90
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,590
having people come together what's the
structure like and in this last point

91
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,430
what are the network structures

92
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:08,620
behind individual participants if you're
familiar with social network analysis it

93
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,999
all the way in which we create kinda
graphical representations

94
00:05:11,999 --> 00:05:15,699
communities this is an important thing
to understand if we're trying to

95
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:17,490
understand how we disrupt a group

96
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,669
like a cartoon market it's good to know
how they come together who's a key

97
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:21,449
player

98
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:25,189
if we remove one person does that really
make a difference or do we have to try

99
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:29,240
to take out specific individuals who are
constantly posting or who have some

100
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,490
degree its status

101
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,169
and a lot that can be gleaned through
network analysis cell

102
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:38,009
that's what our study was trying to
accomplish to do that

103
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:41,689
we collected data from 13 different
forms most to them

104
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:45,999
communicating in Russian languages the
reason being

105
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:49,349
that seems to be where most good data is
being sold

106
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:53,560
by individuals in Surrey like based
forums and to a lesser extent you can

107
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,330
find some IRC channels out there

108
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,770
but that was our purpose was to over
sample on russian sites

109
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:03,129
we also tried calling a couple in
English language groups because it begs

110
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,999
the question with the russians are
really good at this what about those

111
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:07,460
groups that are communicating

112
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,779
in languages that individuals can easily
access

113
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:13,930
so people in the US you could use google
translate

114
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:17,080
but it's not always a really good clean
clear

115
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,889
easy mechanism to understand so if
you're trying to get into the carting

116
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:25,349
you might go into a US or at least an
english-based forum

117
00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:29,169
and try to buy so we try to do some
comparisons between the English language

118
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:31,009
side and the Russian side

119
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:35,059
and we had sites that were hosted across
the world several other them in Russia

120
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:38,069
a few them in the US and then various
parts of Europe

121
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:41,499
and we grabbed a lot of data in the
process she can see we've got some

122
00:06:41,499 --> 00:06:45,809
significant variation like 590 threads
from a Latvian foreign

123
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:50,249
they communicate in English in 202 from
a Russian one that had both in English

124
00:06:50,249 --> 00:06:52,059
section and a Russian section

125
00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:55,650
so we've got a variety of different data
that we can bring to bear

126
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:59,539
on the study and just to give you a
sense that the range

127
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:03,680
up products that are out there this is
how we were able to break down

128
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,080
everything that was sole the majority of
information

129
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,689
in a our sample forms involves something
regarding data sales

130
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:16,610
first being dunce anybody know what a
dump is

131
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:20,389
coupley for those who don't a dump is
account data

132
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:24,300
it could be a bank account it could be a
debit card could be a credit card

133
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,529
it's just data in a rar usable format
that may have different amounts

134
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:32,710
track information with the magnetic
strip on the back at your hotel key on

135
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,719
the back in your credit card or debit
card

136
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:38,389
contains different information on the
tracks and so the more tracks you have

137
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:40,180
the more data that you can use

138
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,469
from the account so down to the key
vehicle

139
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:47,219
that people sell in these markets
followed by CVV

140
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:50,270
I'm CDs are the three digit number on
the back your card

141
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,930
that you use when you're making an
online purchase or something over the

142
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,550
phone

143
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:57,979
that indicate you have the card in hand
so CTV's are great especially if you

144
00:07:57,979 --> 00:07:58,479
wanna make

145
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,259
electronic purchases right off the bat
but for those who are really interested

146
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:04,439
in trying to do some serious harm

147
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:07,439
a small number of people also sold were
called falls

148
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:10,960
fools are all the account information
falls allow you

149
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,499
in part to engage in what's called a
Cobb or a change in billing address

150
00:08:15,499 --> 00:08:18,550
so imagine your somebody belongs the
Rotary Club

151
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:22,669
next door you probably only look at your
statements when they come

152
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:27,339
via the mail you may not do online
banking so if you get somebody's

153
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:31,169
card data who only checks the physical
statement when it's over

154
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:34,729
when it arrives you could very easily
hijacked that account

155
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:38,800
have it sent to another address and you
get a month's worth the time to try to

156
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,589
play with it

157
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:43,089
to massage it maybe start making small
purchases or at least

158
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:46,310
try to use it for the maximum out amount
of time

159
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,829
before either the financial institution
that holds the account for the victim

160
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:53,070
realizes what's going on

161
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:56,360
but from there there's a bunch of other
ancillary products that are sold

162
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,009
bank accounts such as the username and
passwords you can pay pal accounts

163
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:04,160
rich and give up a pallet count

164
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,300
must be good will see a shocking
statistic i think im just a minute about

165
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,019
you can pay pal accounts

166
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:14,019
but people also selling ancillary things
like Steam accounts are sky

167
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:17,019
for whatever you might put money into

168
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:20,529
from there a lot of people also offer
data manipulation products

169
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:23,540
so that's where you take data that you
purchase

170
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,029
in turn it into some sort love monetized

171
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:30,699
product in the real world that involves
cash out service

172
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:34,940
we small a small group of people
offering cash out services where they

173
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,620
would

174
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,970
imprint your electronic data onto cards

175
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,220
and physically go to you ATM's are
different places to either make

176
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,100
purchases

177
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,310
are withdrawn money for the maximum
allowable amount on a daily basis

178
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,089
if your gonna use a cash-out service
you're also going to need to buy

179
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,220
plastics

180
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,630
and plastics are like your hotel key
it's just a blank card with a magnetic

181
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,370
strip

182
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,019
you can imprint the date on that and
then go to town so long as the

183
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:02,660
terminally are you making a purchase at

184
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,930
doesn't look at the card you don't even
have to put anything on the front

185
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,949
just wipe it benefits under 50 bucks for
you don't have to sign

186
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:12,430
so it's an easy way to start
manipulation

187
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:16,290
from there we also saw a majority I love
data manipulators

188
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,800
offering virtual services that involves
drops

189
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,810
people who will physically receive
products

190
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:26,149
so say if you buy a laptop for an x-box
winer

191
00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:29,190
ps4 you can have it shipped to a
location

192
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:33,569
and your drops provider will pick it up
on it fence it may be just mail it to

193
00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:34,420
you directly

194
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,930
but they'll serve as an intermediary to
help reduce the likelihood that your

195
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:41,850
purchase gets easier otherwise captured
by someone

196
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:46,199
and then money transfer services where
they will launder money on your behalf

197
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:50,930
maybe they'll set up a fake shop and
start charging ten dollar purchases

198
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,630
with the cards that you buy they'll give
you ninety percent of each transaction

199
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:58,350
they take ten percent for themselves it
varies by selling

200
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,680
but a lot of different mechanisms are
out there to get money

201
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,709
from there we saw a lot of associated
services these are things that

202
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:09,269
are potentially useful to either acquire
data

203
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:13,660
or to manipulate so some people are
offering low level malwares and

204
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,550
keyloggers nobody necessarily offerings
use a good fishing products

205
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:22,180
but certainly you can use to get data
and and dedicated hosting

206
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,399
spam lists some limited equipment like

207
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:28,990
a.m. you could buy some equipment like
cell phones or computers or something

208
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:29,930
like that

209
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:33,000
but we also saw a limited number of
people in

210
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,290
the data acquisition game who are
offering skims

211
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:39,339
anybody notice cameras call

212
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:43,490
those you don't skimmers device you
click onto an ATM regions put on your

213
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:43,980
belt

214
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,339
it's a read/write device that captures
trackday so that way swipe it

215
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:51,959
it doesn't actually make transactions
just captures the data in memory

216
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:56,209
and our skimmer sellers would offer
products that hold about 2,000 swipes

217
00:11:56,209 --> 00:11:59,130
some of them would give you
configurations to try to set up a small

218
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,910
camera or something like that

219
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:04,139
so data acquisition products are out
there but in limited

220
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:09,420
circumstances in our date this is just
one example if the network structures

221
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,629
that we saw this is just one forum

222
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:15,940
you can see there's arrange a different
connections between people

223
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,660
I'll talk about this just a little bit
later on but just to give you a sense

224
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,129
that the relationships it's not like
there's

225
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:24,290
lots and lots a deep connective 80
between individuals

226
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:28,069
they're sorta small networks that are
devised in structured and

227
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:32,110
break up and come apart based on who's
doing what

228
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:35,990
and so in thinking about the sales
process this is where we can really see

229
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,810
some interesting things

230
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:41,529
when you go to one of these forums the
one thing you're gonna wanna do

231
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:45,850
is to read the posts because that's
where the ads come into play

232
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:49,769
so this is an ad for somebody selling
dunce get everybody in the back to read

233
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:50,250
this

234
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,610
and out small print good

235
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:58,500
cell this is a dumps list guys offering
his prices per product you can see

236
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,870
US Klassiker standard cards a twenty
dollars

237
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:05,959
if you've got a gold or platinum card
it's 25 if you own a business or

238
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:08,040
corporate cards thirty dollars

239
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,579
an Amex are twenty what's interesting is
that all these dumb sellers breakout

240
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:13,690
product in this

241
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:17,199
fashion they say how much each specific
piece goes for

242
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:21,209
they may offer bulk discounts depending
on how many pieces you buy

243
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:24,819
but they are explicitly going to tell
you what their structures alike

244
00:13:24,819 --> 00:13:28,629
some have a question get cell

245
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:31,839
Canada it's interesting their data is
little more expensive and so our

246
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,740
European and Asian cards and those from
other countries could be availability

247
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:39,329
could be the chip and pin differential
given that we don't use those in the US

248
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:41,120
that might be part of why

249
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,579
we see these products being offered for
a little ass also there easy to get if

250
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:47,839
you think about how much data is
currently in the market space

251
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,440
cell you poster at you explain what you
have available

252
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,449
and then you explain your actual
purchasing process

253
00:13:55,449 --> 00:13:59,389
everybody has the ability as a seller to
dictate the terms

254
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:02,870
have any encounter they stipulate how
things work

255
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:06,120
this particular dump seller says here's
how it goes

256
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,139
you contact us there are support line
they have a dedicated

257
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:13,259
ICQ support line running 24/7 through
instant messaging

258
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:16,310
that way you contact them you say

259
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:21,019
calculate the total price and submit
your order say 100 dance from the US

260
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:25,209
all classic cards you tell them how much
you want

261
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:28,250
and you tell them how much you're
willing to pay

262
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,970
their price list is there but you could
maybe offer something a little lower

263
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:35,459
from there send us money and your

264
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:38,860
email this is really interesting this is
the one

265
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:43,319
thing that makes these markets quite
distinct from traditional

266
00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:46,779
markets for illicit products like say
with prostitution

267
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:50,180
you negotiate the price in advance and
then you get down to it

268
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,379
with drugs you walk up to your dealer

269
00:14:53,379 --> 00:14:56,990
you give them the cash and you'll get
product pretty immediately thereafter

270
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:01,529
you may have to walk down the street
they are gonna get with this

271
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:06,629
the seller manages everything and in
this case you send them money in advance

272
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:10,079
they have 24 hours to complete your
order cell

273
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,970
you could wait a day and hopefully get
your product you can wait a day and they

274
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,220
may do nothing

275
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,759
as a result sellers have all the power
and buyers can be

276
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:21,939
easily rocked and lose money

277
00:15:21,939 --> 00:15:24,949
admittedly who's gonna feel bad for a
guy who buy stolen data

278
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:28,990
and never gets the data nobody right
where the unit to call the cops and say

279
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:33,339
the thousand downside but don't work or
alternatively they never came

280
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:36,529
you're not so how do buyers

281
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:41,230
try to navigate this type of market
space given you've got some great risk

282
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,899
involved

283
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:46,430
for this guy this particular vendor he
says we will

284
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:50,600
replace only pick up hold called ounce
within a 24-hour period

285
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,779
so they're saying to their customers
your bi data from us will send it to you

286
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:56,040
within 24 hours

287
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,999
and we're giving you a degree of
customer service so if you buy data from

288
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,459
us

289
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:05,560
and some of them don't work let us now
and will give you free replacements

290
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,639
that's pretty nights right there
actually giving a modicum

291
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,870
up support for their buyer and that's
one way that individuals in this

292
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,389
marketplace can figure out who work with

293
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:19,040
if you want reduce risk you go to the
person who says they're gonna help you

294
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,959
in terms the transaction

295
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,519
and everybody dictates their particular
payment preference

296
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:27,620
Liberty Reserve was common in our data
but so is web money

297
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,709
and a limited number would even take
Western Union or some differential

298
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:31,790
payment systems

299
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:35,439
but everybody seem to want electronic
payment primarily

300
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:38,470
from there they're gonna wanna talk via
ICQ

301
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,689
a limited proportion would contact each
other via email

302
00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:45,240
but at least within the Russian group
and even the limited English ones we had

303
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,290
everybody seem to prefer ICQ moving from
the dumps portion

304
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:54,790
here's an ad for Pay Pal counts this is
where things get pretty interesting

305
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,949
their vending for US and UK Pay Pal
accounts

306
00:16:57,949 --> 00:17:01,680
if you have an unverified account with a
credit card it's one dollar

307
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,000
WMZ is Wed money US or Liberty Reserve

308
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,599
unverified with the bank count one
dollar if you have a verified

309
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,670
party if you want a verified account
with a credit card number and a bank

310
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,050
account

311
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:17,230
it's freed up seeking a match in that's
not very much your initial investment

312
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:22,640
is superior leelo in order to get some
potential usable data

313
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,860
they say we also have accounts with
email just ask we accept web money

314
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,110
Liberty Reserve

315
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:31,429
and hear their terms purchase the seller
is not responsible for

316
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:35,570
SM or security measures we check all the
accounts manually prior to giving them

317
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,010
to you

318
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:40,080
and you also get a clean socks 5 they'll
give you a proxy so that way if you're

319
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,470
dealing with say a US pay pal account

320
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:46,549
be here in Germany you go through the
proxy the transactional go through

321
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:49,590
all the sudden you're getting German
traffic to your US account

322
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,919
it's probably not gonna work so they're
trying to help you out by offering a

323
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:53,730
modicum

324
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:57,159
customer support but this last point
sellers not responsible for

325
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:01,110
unsuccessful use it to the account if
you burn the proxy if you somehow screw

326
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:01,740
up

327
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:06,039
that's not our fault that's you cell
they're trying to help but they're only

328
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:07,460
gonna go so far

329
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,700
and then finally here's an ad for a cash
outs

330
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:16,100
our party forum money transfers they say
we cash funds in the Russian Federation

331
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,590
receivers electronic bank transfer we
will do encashment

332
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:23,669
we will transmit electronic funds will
divert funds orkut the Council have been

333
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:27,370
seized by authorities will even work
with dirty funds money that is acquired

334
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,409
different fashions

335
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:32,590
the benefit of working with this group
is as they say low commissions

336
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:36,419
we only take a small proportion of your
money and speed

337
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:39,559
as a rule funds are received on that day
that their credit

338
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:42,870
so you're not gonna have to wait long if
you bought a bunch a dance if you work

339
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,520
with us

340
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,320
will cash it out quickly and send it
back to you as soon as we can

341
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,309
sup add to the way to understand how
these markets work

342
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:55,580
and the sales process starts with the at
to give you a sense the range

343
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,299
I love variation in product given that I
said earlier there's not a lot of

344
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:00,409
estimates for the

345
00:19:00,409 --> 00:19:04,580
economy within this market space you can
see there's a bunch of different things

346
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,279
are offered

347
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:08,820
and a tremendous variation in actual
pricing structures

348
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,860
like for dance the price goes from four
cents to eight thousand dollars

349
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,390
that's a massive degree variation the
average

350
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:19,419
as a result for Dom's is a hundred and
two dollars so

351
00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:23,210
if we take that is just the potential
investment that a person might have on

352
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,760
average they're gonna spend a hundred
and two dollars

353
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,000
but we've got products that don't even
necessarily have

354
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,419
a price list like with cash out services

355
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:35,770
only six percent actually provided any
estimate for

356
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:39,309
cost sometimes it would just be percent
it really varies

357
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:42,529
with the the CVV item that I mentioned
earlier

358
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:46,870
it's interesting this is the second most
plentiful product and all our forums

359
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:50,860
and the average is twenty six dollars in
21 cents

360
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,919
keep that mind because it's much lower
than done but they're

361
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,010
may be a potential explanation for that

362
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:00,529
when we look at the variation in terms
of the origins

363
00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:04,460
update with down's being the most
plentiful products sold

364
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,590
we can see the majority of it appears to
come from

365
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:12,070
the European Union and then the United
States but if we parse that by country

366
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,779
of origin

367
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:15,970
or partly by language up the 40

368
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:20,309
the English language forums are where we
see the largest proportion

369
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:24,309
have information about the origin update
on the russian side of things it's very

370
00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:25,510
very low

371
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:29,070
and there's a reason for that it seems
as though dumps are heavy

372
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:33,620
advertised in the US side or at least
earner english-language boards

373
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,600
they're also sold in the russian but
they don't give as much information

374
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,990
about the origins

375
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:42,820
the data itself instead he might have to
pick that up by engaging with the seller

376
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,169
directly

377
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:48,260
when we compare prices by country of
origin

378
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,700
%uh the data we can also see some
interesting things emerge these are some

379
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,679
very basic

380
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:55,940
descriptive statistics trying to
understand is there a significant

381
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,330
difference in price

382
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:02,220
for each country and with bank account
data the only statistically significant

383
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,220
difference we see is with Europe

384
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:09,070
for dunce there are lots and lots of
different pricing structures that are

385
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:09,960
present

386
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,230
the US data for Dom's is somewhat cheap
at

387
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,760
an average is three dollars in 85 cents
but its

388
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:21,620
cheaper to buy UK data Russian data data
from Europe and from other places around

389
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:25,149
the world so there's some substantial
variation depending on how we

390
00:21:25,149 --> 00:21:30,770
parse out this information

391
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:35,039
say that again 0 have we look to China

392
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,630
know we've not look to China it's a
really interesting question

393
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:42,179
the Chinese forms that are out there we
didn't get into just

394
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:45,890
trying to again focus on russia but even
seeing if there's Chinese product

395
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:46,500
offered

396
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,260
most the time the individuals would only
say Asia they would not go in depth in

397
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,190
terms of is the South Korean is this
Vietnamese just

398
00:21:53,190 --> 00:22:00,190
Asia general so we can speak much about
that

399
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:07,320
why is there such a low percentage in
Asian day

400
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:12,649
oh why is there such a low percentage a
UK data here

401
00:22:12,649 --> 00:22:17,179
okay the low percentage in UK data here
we can't say for certain

402
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:20,409
all we can discern is that this is a
small proportion %uh

403
00:22:20,409 --> 00:22:27,409
the total question

404
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:45,780
yeah that's entirely possible the
mechanics for control data could be

405
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:49,060
driving a lot of this it could be that
there's better chip and pin encryption

406
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:49,770
it could be

407
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:55,820
any number of things exactly as
signature at point of sale

408
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,910
it's under 50 dollars know it. check it
it really screws things up

409
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:05,910
guy

410
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:15,890
mmm that's a very good point to the you

411
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:19,030
party the European Union has much more
stringent or at least very well

412
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:22,650
detailed a concerns and policies about
data protection

413
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:29,650
that might be a part of what we're
seeing here yes

414
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:37,880
that's a good point to maybe it's
economic within country that's part of

415
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,269
it too

416
00:23:38,269 --> 00:23:42,679
no we haven't we're actually trying now
to develop some very very rough

417
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:46,220
estimates as to how country economics
might influence

418
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:50,269
data availability but at least just from
a surface explanation know there's

419
00:23:50,269 --> 00:23:51,190
there's not much there

420
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:58,190
but it could very well be yessir that is
an excellent point and I'm gonna get to

421
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:04,269
that in just a minute so I'll talk about
product testing in

422
00:24:04,269 --> 00:24:07,889
in just a moment in moving beyond

423
00:24:07,889 --> 00:24:11,260
the process a actually interpreting an
ad

424
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:16,000
what's important to note is part of why
we may not see much in terms of economic

425
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,750
estimates is because all the sales take
place outside up the forms

426
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:25,190
we don't get to see the clear text
communication between buyer and seller

427
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:28,630
so since it's all via ICQ or emailer
Jaber

428
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:32,769
or maybe to a limited extent through
private messaging we can see how much a

429
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:33,740
person buys

430
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:37,500
or how much they pay for it the only
thing that we know is that these are the

431
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,700
common mechanisms for payment Liberty
Reserve WebMoney

432
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:45,350
Western Union Moneygram but on this
point of customer service

433
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,870
why would a vendor go to so much trouble
to say here's what we're going to do to

434
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:49,490
help you

435
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:53,230
and why is there and escrow payment
system

436
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:57,380
that emerges some other forms in our
sample actually offer a vehicle

437
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:00,659
to ensure that both buyer and seller are
happy with their transaction

438
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:04,740
these have an escrow system is there so
that way if you don't think you can

439
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,600
trust the person you're working

440
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,889
the buyer you want to engage you can
contact the grantor or the escrow agent

441
00:25:11,889 --> 00:25:15,960
in some of our forums and say I wanna
buy from this person

442
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,500
they're willing to accept escrow
payments so can you work with us

443
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,850
this is a breakdown of the rules from
whatever forms for how it actually works

444
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,399
the buyer and the seller

445
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:27,500
have to reach an agreement on working
with the grantor so everybody has to say

446
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,230
that's fine

447
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:31,480
next they contact the grantor through
ICQ

448
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,120
one other parties gives money the other
the goods and then

449
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,389
everything is released from there so
that way as soon as the escrow or

450
00:25:38,389 --> 00:25:39,419
grantor says

451
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:42,850
I've got both the release it to the
appropriate parties everybody should be

452
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:43,389
happy

453
00:25:43,389 --> 00:25:46,659
also your answers and one of our boards
take

454
00:25:46,659 --> 00:25:50,049
a percentage sell it fits 3 up that
permeates

455
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:54,299
up to thirty dollar purchases are free
but from there it's prorated sector

456
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:57,700
buying say three thousand dollars worth
of data if you work with the grantor

457
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,380
it's five percent of the total

458
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:03,309
so you're going to have to pay a little
bit more up front but the value is that

459
00:26:03,309 --> 00:26:03,960
you know

460
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,220
you're going to get what you pay for
because your risk is lowered by knowing

461
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,380
a grantor is going to be there to help
you and

462
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:15,510
customer service the use of escrow
agents the user other mechanisms

463
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:19,090
are all there because individuals don't
know who to trust

464
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:23,039
and it's interesting because this
creates a marketplace

465
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,610
that is driven by much like with Amazon
e-bay

466
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:29,909
customer feedback since we can see how
much people by

467
00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:34,409
we can see that individual buyers will
come back in the form and say

468
00:26:34,409 --> 00:26:37,750
wow this guy was great this guy gave me
exactly what I want

469
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:42,120
internet's going influence who buys
product from that individual

470
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:46,340
and it affects the reputation %uh the
seller because if people are saying this

471
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,169
guy's great

472
00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:51,990
fast data good information they're going
to go back to that person and in fact

473
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:54,889
here's just a an example a positive
feedback

474
00:26:54,889 --> 00:26:57,960
for a money launder this person says

475
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,570
a the thread starter laundered three
hundred dollars for me speeds comparable

476
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:03,260
the second cosmic speed

477
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:06,370
everything was magnificent I'll go back
the next one

478
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:09,480
I did some laundering money from a
female partner everything was quick

479
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,760
an excellent and the thread starter
takes a small percentage which makes you

480
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,240
happy

481
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,340
cell it doesn't cost much you get
exactly what you need

482
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:23,340
yet

483
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:29,920
the grantor's are there because they
have a reputation within the four

484
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,290
people know that they can trust that
individual they've been designated by

485
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:36,290
a moderator or someone love stats

486
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:39,920
so they're not going to its gone in less
for some reason all of the sudden

487
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,929
they've gone rogue

488
00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:44,910
which we don't see many reports have at
least in our date that may happen

489
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:48,600
but we can't necessarily speak to that
issue but

490
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,360
the reason why they're there is because
so many buyers do in fact go

491
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:56,240
and that's where an important concept
emerges when you read

492
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,460
positive and negative feedback people
ask

493
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:04,429
can I trust this person and negative
feedback commonly implies the term

494
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:08,010
Ripper rivers are people who ripped you
off

495
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:11,280
they don't send you your data where the
data that they sell is John

496
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,790
and so if you buy from a river you're
going to lose all the money that you

497
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:15,520
invested

498
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,460
some other sellers who are really trying
to build their reputation if somebody

499
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:23,170
makes a complaint will come back in and
say that's absolutely false

500
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:26,550
in fact this one here the seller Denver
says I'm no Ripper

501
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:29,610
I've never had a complaint this poster
just wants to cause trouble

502
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:34,000
maybe that they re competing vendor
using a fraudulent account what he says

503
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,520
next is really interesting I've never
dealt with them before

504
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:40,110
there are no logs to back up his claim
moderator please ban him

505
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:43,290
are better forums actually required

506
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:48,250
any negative feedback to the company by
the fall ICQ chat log so everybody could

507
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:50,650
see exactly when and how the rep of

508
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:53,670
took place otherwise your groundless
claims

509
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:58,550
are not necessarily going to help cell
this is an important way in which

510
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:00,260
individuals are trying to manage

511
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:04,950
the space and we've already mentioned
escrow agents another important thing

512
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,000
that comes in

513
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,179
is reviewer in approval sell some of our
forums for them

514
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:14,309
offered product testing services this is
just one

515
00:29:14,309 --> 00:29:17,950
indication of product testing all the
members here are advised not to deal

516
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:21,470
or buy anything from unverified sellers
if you do so

517
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:25,910
you're gonna get scan we are not
responsible the onus is on you to take

518
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:26,929
full advantage

519
00:29:26,929 --> 00:29:30,710
our resources we offer product testing
we offer verification

520
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:33,720
deal with verified sellers for all the
sellers who want to get themselves

521
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,120
verified contact me through PM

522
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,610
or through private messaging cell
they're trying to make their market

523
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:44,200
regulated and control and in order to
get your product

524
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,320
tested or check you have to send data to
the individual

525
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,880
who's assigned for that for this is just
one description how checking takes place

526
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,190
taking a good as done by one person we
remove their name

527
00:29:56,190 --> 00:30:00,130
the Czech glass from one to three days
after the check the moderator guarantees

528
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,559
there will not be any flames

529
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:04,910
and that the quality goods will not be
discussed in other words they close off

530
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:05,710
the topic

531
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:10,059
if your products been tested the forum
guarantees that you are reliable

532
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:14,030
the moderator Rights review on this and
then closes the topic

533
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:17,050
ever requirement for product testing is
refused

534
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:20,750
you risk being banned in your
announcement erased we don't take any

535
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,780
money for testing

536
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:25,260
we just do this so that way everyone
knows who they can rely on

537
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:29,210
so checking is an important mechanism
when we're thinking about how this

538
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:30,110
market space

539
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:33,220
is regulated and that feeds into this
issue

540
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:38,679
%uh what is sold and how when we look at
our entire sample for

541
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:42,200
dumps are the most common product
followed by CVV

542
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,450
when we kick out to our forums that

543
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:50,300
had a preponderance %uh ripping
complaints it's interesting that CVV

544
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:54,120
totally drop out of the top 10 in fact
this number dropped below fifty

545
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,130
we still see a number of people offering
dunce but

546
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:01,360
the nature of the form has a tremendous
impact on what people are selling

547
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,340
that might be why the cost for CTV's if
you remember being an average twenty

548
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,320
five dollars

549
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,520
is so low you're buying a product that
is extremely risky

550
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:14,250
at least within the sample and you can
imagine if you're a vendor

551
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:18,160
any ripping board and your advertising
see the visa 20 bucks

552
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:22,290
if you get some dupe who buys a thousand
your CV V's

553
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:26,070
that's good money you do that a handful
of times you've got a nice month

554
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:29,540
had to be you've got a few thousand
dollars in the bank all because somebody

555
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,160
was dumb enough to respond here at

556
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:36,260
sup risk is an important thing that
seems a structure

557
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:40,100
the economics up this board and when we
think about profits

558
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,860
generally this is where things get very
hard to do

559
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,000
largely because we don't have good

560
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,520
evidence as to how much a final product
goes for

561
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:54,490
all we can based on our either the
initial advertised price

562
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:57,700
or we can also try to overly the average
so

563
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:01,090
just thinking for a moment if we take
the average for dumps at a hundred and

564
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:02,090
two dollars

565
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:06,020
if somebody wants to buy a hundred us
they're looking at ten thousand dollars

566
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,890
in terms their initial investment

567
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:11,340
if you wanna buy a day n Pay Pal account
if we got the average

568
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,669
given we've got a real difference
between the lower and the upper bound

569
00:32:14,669 --> 00:32:18,179
we're looking at an average twenty seven
dollars see by 50 counts

570
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:22,300
its 1300 out if we try to find

571
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:26,980
estimates for actual loss one of the
only good metrics that we found lately

572
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,020
is from the Bureau of Justice Statistics
on

573
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:34,250
funds directly acquired by identity
thieves they don't specify this is high

574
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,980
tech for low tech identity theft

575
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:40,250
just how much money is taken and they
parted by credit and debit card

576
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:44,130
and you can see the average is a
thousand dollars are parting 1,448

577
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,620
dollars for credit cards

578
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:49,740
and 552 dollars for debit cards we take
the median

579
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:53,060
its 300 for credit and 200 for debt

580
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:56,350
cell just trying to do some very basic

581
00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:01,000
return on investments for the bad guys
we can see some massive variation

582
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,710
depending on what statistic which you
see years

583
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:07,940
cell if we take the average loss for
credit cards

584
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:11,270
a potential dumps purchase could net

585
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:14,960
ninety four thousand dollars for the
initial investment of ten thousand

586
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,300
that's a great return on investment
that's a massive yield

587
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:22,309
if we take the median its 19,000 still
not bad

588
00:33:22,309 --> 00:33:25,650
but certainly not as great as that a at

589
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:29,050
we take the debit card loss we're
looking at 35

590
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:32,380
thousand-dollar pretty good for your
initial by

591
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:35,500
if we take the median it's only thirteen

592
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:40,059
so profits are extremely variable in
really hard to bust out

593
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:43,380
when we look at the eBay and pay pal
purchasing

594
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,620
things get even more interesting because
the amount of money thing or bad guy

595
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,780
could make

596
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:52,400
is really good by comparison how much
they initially have to invest

597
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:56,360
thirty-six thousand dollars for credit
cards potentially if we take the apt

598
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:00,390
take the median 7500 still not a bad
investment

599
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:03,950
with the debit cards its 13,000 were
five thousand

600
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:07,080
but still buying eBay and pay pal data
seems to be an

601
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,470
ideal way to go you make a lot of money

602
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:13,530
now there are a ton of problems with
this estimate

603
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:17,409
I will be the first to admit it but this
is at least one pass to try to figure

604
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:19,870
out how much money people can make

605
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:24,070
and that's why I'm titled the stock
comparing apples and lemons

606
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:30,399
what you're buying has tremendous impact
on what you potentially stand to make

607
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:33,409
in some research by Hurley in Florencia

608
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:36,550
they talk about ripping markets as being
lemon markets

609
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:40,629
you don't know who you can trust are
what you can buy and Sophie spend

610
00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:44,490
ten thousand dollars or even a thousand
on Dom's and none of them work

611
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:48,429
you're simply out money like buying a
bad car the brakes in you drive out a

612
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:49,510
law

613
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:53,669
but there's no lemon laws for buying
date so how do you protect yourself how

614
00:34:53,669 --> 00:34:53,960
do you

615
00:34:53,960 --> 00:35:00,960
insulate yourself from this rest

616
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:09,990
exactly it is kinda like playing the
stock should gotta figure out what's a

617
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:12,810
good company to invest in what's a good
vendor to invest in

618
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:17,940
who's a blue chip and who's not and
that's where the final issue comes in in

619
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:18,430
terms

620
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:22,010
organization the better forums are the
ones who have

621
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:26,320
a substantial degree administrative
oversight the ones who have product

622
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,470
testing the one who have asked the ones
that have

623
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:31,580
ask her legions are also going to a
certain extent

624
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:35,090
micromanage encounters between
individuals in the forms

625
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:39,180
so not only are they going to control
who can post an ad but what the quality

626
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,070
of products are

627
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:44,260
but they will also actually go back in
and ban users based on comments

628
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:47,590
I'm if you've read anything in the
computer science literature about these

629
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,170
markets

630
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:52,060
some people have argued we should engage
in civil attacks we can just flood the

631
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,720
market with messages that

632
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,730
don't trust this person don't trust this
person don't trust this person and try

633
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:57,580
to disrupt

634
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:01,950
by affecting the perception have every
vendor based on

635
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:05,930
what we've been able to observe in some
a far better forms that only going or

636
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:09,410
in ripping sites where people don't know
who to trust already in the heavily

637
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:10,870
managed forums

638
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:14,340
that's going to relatively make little
difference

639
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,570
it'll probably just annoy administrators
who will then blocked the accounts or

640
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:18,940
try to find a way to limit

641
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:24,200
that type of activity because this at
post from 12 the administrator says

642
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,870
here are rules don't leave fictitious
topics

643
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:31,120
effect transactions been carried out you
have to provide

644
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:35,300
appropriate proof if this is back bernie
if this causes violated

645
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,610
the fictitious review gets banned
service the user yes

646
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:45,610
that's a good question

647
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:50,200
one of the English language forms in our
sample you could argue had this happen

648
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,100
where the administrator who was trying
to control things just said you know

649
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:53,410
what

650
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:57,170
I give up we're not quite sure what
happened because we got in

651
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:00,380
at the tail end of it we only had about
two years worth of data

652
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:03,440
and you could see the administrator
making lot of posts like wow

653
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,620
nobody's going through a check service
nobody's doing this I keep telling you

654
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,800
don't buy from

655
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,980
unverified sellers but people kept doing
so and so after a little while it

656
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,380
appeared as though the administrators
just said you know what we're done

657
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:18,050
you guys do what you're gonna do we've
done our best to manage things

658
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:21,870
they didn't have any kind of grantor or
escrow agent service or

659
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:25,360
or anyone who is necessarily a product
tester so the fact that they were

660
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,370
somewhat deregulated to start with

661
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:31,180
maybe is part of why they eventually
reached assorted hands-off approach

662
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:34,620
mmm

663
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:38,920
the point maybe

664
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,770
and we haven't been able to fully this
aggregate this it could be

665
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:46,930
that individuals who are moderators in a
ripping heavy forum

666
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:50,520
may in fact be ripping off people
themselves there's no necessary

667
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,270
guarantee that they're not posting
fictitious assets themselves

668
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:58,180
so we we can't necessarily speak to why
forms run like this but certainly the

669
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,400
amount of money that you could make

670
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,100
even by ripping people off may be
sufficient to generate some forms that

671
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,259
are deregulated

672
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:09,740
and risky to start thats one idea
potentially South several attacks might

673
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,360
not work

674
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:14,730
depending on what goes on when we moved
from these individual encounters where

675
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,170
Inspiron seller had

676
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:19,680
that participatory in terms of feedback
we can also look

677
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,360
at how long they operate and to what
extent their connections between groups

678
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,960
the better forms in our sample actually
cross advertise

679
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,420
so that way a seller will say you can
look at my ad on this board this board

680
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,580
this board and this board

681
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:35,760
and you can see I'm trustworthy cuz I
got positive feedback there

682
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,760
so taking those for forums

683
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:42,300
not only do they provide a place to buy
and sell but they've got escrow systems

684
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,640
they've got manages

685
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:47,600
bernie they've got a managerial
structure in place ways to ensure trust

686
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,319
and to manage transactions

687
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:53,970
their interconnected the other issue is
that several these forms have been

688
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:54,880
around for

689
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,660
literally years one of our forms had an
ad dating back to 2007

690
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:03,380
right guy was selling passport scans and
he was still active as a

691
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:09,040
2012 cell that kinda long Japanese is
something that is really important to

692
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,500
note

693
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,690
if you're thinking about say like
street-corner drug set

694
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:15,940
you may not have somebody has been on
the block for five years you may know

695
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,670
that there's a crack market that's here

696
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:22,930
or that there's prostitution stroll you
can go to that may persist over time

697
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:26,270
but in terms of individual vendors
that's a somewhat different story

698
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:30,280
cell these markets as a whole some of
the better ones

699
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,810
we might think I have as constituting a
formal organization because their

700
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:36,370
persistence overtime

701
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:41,060
they don't have a similar structure to
the Mafia or the accuser

702
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:44,650
in that everything is distributed
there's no one single figurehead

703
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:49,020
regulates everything but it's
distributed across multiple play

704
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:52,720
and that's an interesting point that led
us to do some other social networking

705
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,960
else because we want to understand who
are these individuals and how they work

706
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,910
this is just one example since I'm kinda
butting up against I'm

707
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:04,000
I'm gonna go through this and get over
it but if you'd like

708
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,690
I can send you our full report array we
go through some

709
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:12,100
in general the reason we did this
research is to understand how these

710
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,339
markets work

711
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:17,030
and in the end we wind up with pretty
interesting points

712
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:20,500
the markets themselves are global you
can buy data from anywhere

713
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:24,640
you can potentially make a massive
profit but the risk factors that come in

714
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,910
for buyers

715
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:29,440
is so big that's what makes these
markets to sting from

716
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,540
any other ones in a real world drug
market for prostitution market

717
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:37,030
buyers and sellers have differential
levels a brisk in these markets

718
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:41,000
its almost all the buyers and the fact
that their Colegio

719
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,450
in the people provide positive and
negative feedback that affects the way

720
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:46,780
in which people engaged with one another

721
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:50,420
the market's and their networks are
pretty inefficient you gotta spend a

722
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,460
lotta time

723
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:54,760
if you wanna actually invest your money
wisely

724
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,030
you gotta read all the ads you gotta
read all the feedback and try to make an

725
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,720
informed decision

726
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:03,010
unlike with other forms of crime where
your very very hinder

727
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:06,530
in terms of what you know you can read
fifteen different ads

728
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:10,650
look at all the feedback way the prices
contact the person and then say

729
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:14,830
alright I'll buy from you in a way that
similar to how we buy

730
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:18,910
regular consumer products you can take
the effort in the initiative and

731
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:19,750
understand

732
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:24,530
and minimize risk but given the controls
that are here and some the mechanisms

733
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:26,310
the people have to use

734
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:29,620
they don't always go through this
process so we'd like to think these are

735
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:33,190
more rational offenders but perhaps
they're there now

736
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:36,880
as a result this makes it hard when we
think about disruption

737
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,140
if we wanted to take out a karting
market if there's

738
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:43,530
a hundred people selling dubs taking out
one or two

739
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:47,420
is not going to make a substantial
difference you could take out one or two

740
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,430
great sellers

741
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:51,910
people would fill in that back and so

742
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:55,460
one of the few ways that we think might
be more effective

743
00:41:55,460 --> 00:42:00,180
is to set up full on for similar to like
dark market operation for a few years

744
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:00,910
back

745
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:04,710
if you can control every single
interaction from start to finish

746
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:08,600
that's going to be much much more
preferable to say just eliminating

747
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,940
seller or two we're trying you several
attacks

748
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:16,710
the other Avenue and this may be
extremely interesting when employed

749
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,820
properly

750
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:21,370
is to take out the money systems that
are there

751
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:25,810
if Liberty Reserve which was taken down
in 2012

752
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:29,160
is gone people have to find an alternate
payment mechanism

753
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:32,530
web money maybe next from all

754
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:37,590
evidence to the contrary Liberty our
party web money peers operate at the UK

755
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:40,680
so depending on what kinda partnerships
might be able to use we could disrupt

756
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,070
that system

757
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:45,190
I'm do any be remember Eagle

758
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:50,100
payment system from a long time ago it
operated in part at a Florida but mostly

759
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,430
under the Caribbean

760
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:54,710
lot of people in these markets at the
time were using Eagle as their preferred

761
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,060
payment mechanism

762
00:42:56,060 --> 00:43:00,910
when he eagled was taken out by the US
Department of Justice

763
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:04,780
Eagle went south and everybody had to
swap over to new system

764
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:08,590
but there's more than enough that emerge
cell this is the type of thing that we

765
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:11,010
only have a short term benefit

766
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:14,880
the long-term impact means offenders are
fined alternate ways to get their money

767
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,980
the second stop things but it will only
spur ten-mile

768
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:24,980
damper on it for a period of time and
that might be somewhat more preferable

769
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:29,750
in our boards we didn't see anybody
using bit Kong I have seen that point

770
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:30,650
being accepted

771
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:34,310
in some tore based forms but not at
least in the regular

772
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:38,200
internet-based forms so nothing outside
oven onion types I

773
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,400
sup good question bit going

774
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,680
there's so much tension on it now and
it's what like a thousand dollars for

775
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,760
the coin

776
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,990
I think how much is it

777
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:54,270
okay cell depending on what we're doing
that's going to make a big difference

778
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:57,650
sup one of the main things that we're
trying to

779
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:01,550
argue with all this is a need for better
interactions between

780
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:04,620
law enforcement between industry and
academics

781
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:09,230
ever thinking about ways we're actually
going to you impact these markets mates

782
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,460
we've gotta know how much people are
actually paying for things that might be

783
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:13,150
well-known

784
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:16,480
in law enforcement that might be known
in industry but for academics like

785
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,360
myself

786
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,390
we can see that much we're actually
trying to buy product

787
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:23,810
and unfortunately in universities we
have ethical boards that regulate what

788
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:25,120
we can and can't do

789
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,560
so if I go to my university and say I
need a fifteen thousand dollar grant to

790
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,590
buy stolen credit cards

791
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:33,590
you can imagine that's going to be the
response

792
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:37,900
cell we need partners who can actually
do that on our behalf

793
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:41,460
if we can just get chat logs that's
gonna go a long way

794
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:44,740
because otherwise all we're gonna wind
up with are arguments about

795
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:49,160
how much people might pay but the true
economic reality could be entirely

796
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,410
different

797
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:55,470
and some academics actually started
using all boards from like 2007 and 2009

798
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:56,990
their clubs

799
00:44:56,990 --> 00:45:00,060
you can imagine if we're talking about
an economic set

800
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:03,610
have principles that are guided by
variations over time

801
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:06,330
if we start making policy
recommendations based on what people

802
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:08,170
were doing in 2007

803
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:12,170
and its almost 2015 but I can be worth a
damn

804
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:15,590
so we gotta find better ways to get
information and really

805
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:19,280
assess what's going on if by some
circumstance

806
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,650
we can get in at the front and and no a
certain payments isn't going to be taken

807
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:23,930
out

808
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:27,070
on such-and-such a day we can start
evaluating

809
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:30,260
from that day how people's behavior
starts to change

810
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:34,510
and we can understand and then model the
decision-making process of people

811
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:39,230
the final point and this is an important
one our forums were publicly accessible

812
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:40,300
to a certain extent

813
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:43,590
some of them were registration control
but

814
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:46,830
we didn't have any that required vetted
access

815
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:50,210
some of the best carting in our sites
that are out there now

816
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:54,270
are completely control and shut off you
have to be known

817
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:58,650
by two people who are already members
pair access in getting

818
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:01,720
we didn't have those in our sample so as
a result

819
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:05,250
this may or may not be a reflection what
goes on in those markets

820
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:09,390
but if you have to be a known quantity
already and we can't make a by

821
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:13,150
how are we gonna get so we need
partnerships they can help us get to

822
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:13,910
that point

823
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:17,360
and that's the only way we're really
going to be able to improve what we know

824
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:20,290
about these communities and whether or
not we're really talking about apples

825
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:21,490
and apples or

826
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:25,140
Apple's online sup gunmen here

827
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:32,140
I'm anybody have any questions yes

828
00:46:41,189 --> 00:46:44,499
direct question so wife you have
material do you sell it

829
00:46:44,499 --> 00:46:48,579
rather than using yourself why would you
be willing to go to ATM's are make

830
00:46:48,579 --> 00:46:49,769
purchases online

831
00:46:49,769 --> 00:46:53,049
when you get the information so what's
the decision making process

832
00:46:53,049 --> 00:46:57,640
that's not quite clear we haven't been
able to really get a false sense of why

833
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,479
one person prefers one type of process

834
00:47:00,479 --> 00:47:03,939
over another it may be that there's
different perceptions rest

835
00:47:03,939 --> 00:47:07,519
so one person might feel comfortable
with their skill sets maybe say

836
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:11,259
get data through fishing and then sell
because they don't want to take the time

837
00:47:11,259 --> 00:47:11,689
to

838
00:47:11,689 --> 00:47:15,660
go through each account try to make
purchases maybe they're whereof legal

839
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:19,019
structures enough that they go well my
risk is this high-flying gate in this

840
00:47:19,019 --> 00:47:19,949
activity but

841
00:47:19,949 --> 00:47:23,619
this high-flying gauge in this one so
maybe they're making some cost-benefit

842
00:47:23,619 --> 00:47:24,329
analyses

843
00:47:24,329 --> 00:47:28,279
we're trying to find ways to get at
those questions now

844
00:47:28,279 --> 00:47:32,679
but realistically the only thing that we
can say is that since people can make

845
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:37,679
a profit selling data some may feel like
it's and better use their time to

846
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:38,989
acquire information

847
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:42,939
and take a small proportion of the total
so saving account might be worth a

848
00:47:42,939 --> 00:47:43,539
thousand

849
00:47:43,539 --> 00:47:47,719
your selling it for ten dollars that's a
good enough return on your time

850
00:47:47,719 --> 00:47:51,619
to to make it worthwhile those who buy
data may not know enough actually

851
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:53,039
manipulate it themselves

852
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:56,900
so the secondary market for data
manipulation may have emerged as a

853
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:58,019
result to people going

854
00:47:58,019 --> 00:48:01,049
wow this new doesn't know what he's
doing for helping me this much

855
00:48:01,049 --> 00:48:04,390
I do it for so summer that may be
driving the decision process

856
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:11,390
yes

857
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:22,280
that's a great question to be honest I
don't know its

858
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:25,810
really hard to tell how accurate our
estimate could be

859
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:28,980
the extent to which some in his success
on actually manipulating

860
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:32,440
eBay account to get a thousand dollar
dollars out a bit I don't know

861
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,980
given that he Bay and Pay Pal now
they're closely associated

862
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:39,730
pay pal lets you make transactions in
China or wherever electronically

863
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:43,010
now that that might make it a somewhat
easier venue to go through especially if

864
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:44,950
you're just buying products: willy-nilly
and

865
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:48,350
having them shipped somewhere so could
be a part yes

866
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:55,050
are some people would provide

867
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:58,950
a statement about how many thousands up
cards that they had

868
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:02,630
in one instance we actually had a vendor
who set these are dumps for wholesale

869
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:06,230
and that amount was somewhere in the
neighborhood few thousand

870
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:11,020
so is selling it specifically for others
to resell but the quantity detail varied

871
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:12,600
from seller to seller so

872
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:17,010
there's not enough information or I can
say you know 55 percent its it's much

873
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:17,680
lower than that

874
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:24,680
yes

875
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:27,990
all over data is pre target

876
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:33,339
our data comes from 2007 to 2012
respectively

877
00:49:33,339 --> 00:49:36,839
so during that period yet the Heartland
Payment breach

878
00:49:36,839 --> 00:49:40,599
a you had the dark market takedown and

879
00:49:40,599 --> 00:49:46,250
think target was what 2013 so now we
don't have any target incidents in there

880
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:50,099
but we do have data contemporaneous to
other bridges

881
00:49:50,099 --> 00:49:57,099
I I wish that we could but now we
unfortunately can set up her own boards

882
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,300
that would be

883
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:03,560
really really interesting if we could
happy

884
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:06,960
a great amount of detail I

885
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,990
well if we said we're setting up a form
specifically to allow people to buy and

886
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:11,880
sell accounts

887
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:15,980
again we run into this issue earlier
this facility in crime so why should we

888
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:16,849
let you do that

889
00:50:16,849 --> 00:50:23,849
it's kinda kinda bomber got user

890
00:50:26,369 --> 00:50:30,069
it's a Nairobi problem on the front and
and then we would definitely have to

891
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:31,789
have law enforcement by and

892
00:50:31,789 --> 00:50:34,559
in order to even bring the proposal
forward so that way we could say we're

893
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:37,650
not just going to allow this to happen
but we would communicate it to

894
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:41,539
specific authorities would be interested
so it creates a a variety of different

895
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:42,119
issues I'll

896
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:49,119
once yessir

897
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,680
mmm

898
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:59,599
and certainly several carting forms in
the last couple beers have been run by

899
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:02,329
law enforcement and it seems to be
pretty effective

900
00:51:02,329 --> 00:51:06,650
mechanism for collection because you get
to see all those exchanges especially if

901
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:09,299
you say we only want private message
exchange

902
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:12,440
that way you've got all the PM's to so
it's

903
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:16,200
it could be a very ideal way to go but
you also run in the

904
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:20,220
idea that offenders are not stupid they
don't operate an entire vacuum says some

905
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:21,119
guys are gonna go

906
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,279
that seems really out of joint so I
wouldn't trust

907
00:51:24,279 --> 00:51:31,279
but you are gonna catch a lot a new yes
and I J funding

908
00:51:33,369 --> 00:51:36,750
goes for projects that suit a variety of
different means

909
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:40,069
our project was funded out at the
transnational organized crime

910
00:51:40,069 --> 00:51:41,260
solicitation

911
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:44,650
so that's why we have this kind heavy
focus on organizational dynamics

912
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:48,150
but there are other funding lines for
things like radicalization

913
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:51,990
irrational decision-making are sort of
rational choice premark so so they cover

914
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:58,990
a lot of different things

915
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:07,060
mmm-hmm

916
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:10,530
that would be great yes II had some
interactions a semantic at that time but

917
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:11,480
they never went anywhere

918
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:18,480
so this that'd be great to try to start
again any other questions

919
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:27,070
yeah you know everybody everybody always
ask that if your gonna do this

920
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:31,000
based on everything that we can tell
just sell people stuff you don't even

921
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,480
have to send them products just set up
the air

922
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,880
your risk is so much lower they're not
gonna come after your

923
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:42,980
cell yeah it's not worth buying it's all
worth selling any other questions I

924
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:44,000
guess we'll go in

925
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,790
break is almost here in I'm going to
stop there thank somebody
