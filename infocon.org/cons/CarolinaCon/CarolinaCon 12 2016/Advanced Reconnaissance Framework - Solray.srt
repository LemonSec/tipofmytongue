1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,660
I guess right is actually my talk I was
gonna leave this for a while ago

2
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:22,789
guest artists so thanks for coming
everybody as as we've mentioned got the

3
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:31,080
reconnaissance framework little bit more
about me I'm so we're a member of failed

4
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,290
cyber pathologists is of course and I've
settled once asserts that the one who

5
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:41,420
actually cares about so let's get on
with it says framework is kind of

6
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,420
something that I've been working on for
quite some time now

7
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:50,589
originally came up with the idea after
helping some people do couple hours in

8
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:56,449
research side projects that they were
they were working on through some of

9
00:00:56,449 --> 00:01:00,660
that research that we were doing there
was kind of a number of you know pain

10
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,539
points that we had and some things that
I didn't really think needed to be

11
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:11,310
paying points for something that is as
easy as as always and research and for

12
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:17,159
those I mean I know it's open source
intelligence be easily searched the

13
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,110
internet for things that are just freely
available

14
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:24,909
gathering information gathering data
it's extremely useful for all kinds of a

15
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:35,240
recon phase upend US Cyber attribution
all the other good stuff so after after

16
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,399
going through some of that and you're a
handful conversations with some friends

17
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:44,259
later in town talking about the idea
around this project was born so

18
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:50,200
obviously the most important part of any
project is to name it so the first thing

19
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,960
that I came up with was fails elaborate
labor-saving legit RCN application for

20
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,470
threat intelligence obtained what

21
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:04,390
that I didn't really work out as well
that hoped so we just call it the

22
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,390
advanced reconnaissance framework

23
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:17,440
keep it simple so I started trying to
figure out how I wanted to do this

24
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:24,980
really wanted a candidate trying to
simplify some of the work flow and not

25
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:30,399
put documentation around it but was
having some of the pain we're having

26
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,140
right was going through you have a piece
of data you have an email address

27
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,619
what they might do it there's a
countless number of tools that you can

28
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,250
use that a lot of folks are familiar
with you can go you know take their

29
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,920
email address search for other pieces of
data and you start to get back user

30
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,170
names domain names you name it you can
start to order a lot of things you find

31
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:57,510
more e-mail addresses and circle back
around and start over so I started I

32
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,070
spent a couple hours on the project I
was working on and I started to map this

33
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:06,359
out a workflow diagram quickly realize
that it ended up looking like this and

34
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,980
it was just a complete disaster most
always in research is far too dynamic

35
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,709
you know your search for an email
address today and find somebody's name

36
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:17,870
in the search for it tomorrow with a
different email address unifying wildly

37
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:24,040
different things so trying to do it in a
workflow style just wasn't going to be

38
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,720
something that would actually make
anything better so I can describe the

39
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,470
whole project used immediately threw it
in the trash and started trying to think

40
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:39,250
about how I organize the stuff that we
had into something that would actually

41
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,330
be a little bit more useful for people I
was really struggling with that for a

42
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:47,090
while but luckily Matt and I walked into
a conference room

43
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:51,070
massive on the failure I have worked
with him for a while but walked into a

44
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:56,900
conference room after what was clearly
just incredibly critical meeting and

45
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,540
just answer was there staring me in the
face

46
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,380
lightbulb moment if I needed an OSM
program I just had to develop the

47
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:09,960
program and then I would have a program
is just these is perfect so

48
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,960
lightbulb moment went off I knew exactly
what I needed to do

49
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:18,700
went back and just furiously started
working on it so I ended up with was I

50
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:23,050
started making my map and I spent just a
stupid amount of time dropping stuff

51
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,790
into this mind map obviously this isn't
meant to be readable it's not even

52
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:36,120
really meant to be used as a as a final
product just started it helps the

53
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,450
development process of the program right
this was developed program face and

54
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:49,060
ended up with at least come in with more
not easy to read all coming up with kind

55
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,610
of an organizational structure at least
for the resources and tools out there

56
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:59,470
for hours and research so I broke up
into these categories and then moved on

57
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:06,510
from there so they take a step back real
quick before I i show the the tool and

58
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,440
telling talk about you know goals for
Allison research really a time your

59
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,980
gonna start a new project to do some
information gathering I highly suggest

60
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,630
you sit down take five minutes and
really think about you know what are

61
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:26,610
your goals are you looking for certain
data you know when you're gonna go to

62
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,900
develop when you finish that recording
handed in what needs to be inside the

63
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,900
report for that report to be a success

64
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:40,400
option number one find all the things is
absolutely impossible goal usually quite

65
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,510
entertaining you I love is how terrible
everyone is at privacy makes my job

66
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:52,030
quite entertaining more often your
option number two which is like a

67
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:56,330
specific data goal whether it's trying
to find somebody's real names and

68
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:00,969
contact information location or
technical you know you might be looking

69
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:06,990
for our family or author of a malware
might be looking for all the websites

70
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,660
that a company owns or all the

71
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,290
product information on it could be all
kinds of different things

72
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,990
nine members of the time though when I'm
sitting down for get ready to start a

73
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:25,540
new project this is my goal I'm really
looking for all the things that you're

74
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,940
trying to hide from your mom when I
write my report and I am i reported in I

75
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,700
want that reaction when I get that
reaction I know of one and I'm just

76
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,800
gonna go home for the day

77
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:42,830
realistically though time is really
going to be the number one limiting

78
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:47,320
factor a time you sit down to do some
research whether it's a work related

79
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:54,520
projects you know we're doing recon or
if it's doing threat intelligence or you

80
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,039
like a fun side project right times
always going to be the current you only

81
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,020
have so much time they can be able to
invest in this one said her research so

82
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,140
take that into consideration

83
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:08,050
you know if you know you've got two
hours to do something you're not gonna

84
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,770
put in the same level of effort as you
have forty hours are unlimited time

85
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:17,890
having the luxury of a limited time is
extremely rare so make sure you take

86
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:23,070
that into account when you're you're
getting started so and then one can

87
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,830
defile disclaimer before you do research
on the internet

88
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,830
OPSEC operational security know what it
is

89
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:39,020
know how to do it you don't want to be
these people it's it's obviously the one

90
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:44,140
on your right over there is not her
fault that her upside was reached its

91
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,030
still gonna suck to be that person and
then the one over here on the right was

92
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,270
just brilliant

93
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:56,240
lady who was super excited for winning a
lot of natural you know you do is one

94
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,430
does you post a picture of yourself with
a lot of books all your friends and

95
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:04,750
family can share the joy of your your
moment share your winnings or take them

96
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:10,580
all so when she went to go turn in her
winning lotto ticket they they kindly

97
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,550
informed her that somebody else had
already bought the ticket in her and

98
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:17,510
collected all of her money so she was
not so happy

99
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:23,470
these people are not going to cover up
sex in this hot at all there's lots lots

100
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:27,290
of other guys on the internet stocks
that other conferences that have been

101
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:32,840
done about OPSEC they're very good to go
do your own research on upset learn how

102
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:38,210
to implement it in a minute and then
absolutely critical tested a lot of Ops

103
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:43,520
is technical can be highly technical at
times there's a lot of weird bugs that

104
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:49,699
have come out that your browser or your
system can leak information about you

105
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:54,900
your surf in various websites without
any idea without any knowledge right

106
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,670
it's not something it's no longer just
as easy as you know popping on tour or

107
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:04,290
anonymous VPN and doing research there's
there's more that goes into it go do

108
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:18,040
some research learn again that this is
essentially phase one of the project in

109
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,740
all its glory

110
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:25,520
around the site demo here in a second
but as it around the side you'll you'll

111
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,300
see that there's kind of an unreasonable
number of resources in some categories

112
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:36,520
at last count was over 200 250 ish tools
or raised or resources that are linked

113
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:41,810
to offer this have another four hundred
or so that I might try to put in there

114
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:50,550
over the next couple weeks I'm being a
problem and I'm super lazy so as you go

115
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:53,449
through your research right the
intention and you'll see this to you as

116
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:57,250
a as I actually pull up the site but the
intention is not really did

117
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,360
use every single cool in each category
for a particular piece of data

118
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,019
you know take your time into account a
lot of the tools you can get a lot of

119
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:09,889
people get results on but all the tools
are in here because at some point or

120
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:13,850
another I have found different results
on that particular tool that I did all

121
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:19,870
the rest of them might be 15 things to
search for username 0000 14 of them I

122
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:23,550
give you the same result may 15 2010
might make you something news you

123
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,079
haven't seen before

124
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:57,880
me here for now it's a lesson from work
on my copy stolen code so here are some

125
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,260
bugs with it but bear with me I'm
terrible at coding and learning and

126
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:08,529
trying to get some other stuff going but
it works so I was good enough for me so

127
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:09,320
as you can

128
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,459
the ground on here and then click on
into categories you'll start to see some

129
00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:20,729
other stuff pop up when you can dive
into each of these immortal each of

130
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,720
these categories and usually start to
play with the tools are on here I'll

131
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,410
spend some time on it you're trying to
look for a specific thing you know spent

132
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:32,310
some time in that category pulpit to
look just like everything else right

133
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:41,260
learn the tools you can use for the job
you got and then you'll be successful so

134
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,209
quick demo here

135
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:47,609
user names are added every one of the
most common things you get for trying to

136
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:54,990
do research on particular target so a
lot of people might not know there's

137
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,800
actually a specific user name search
engines

138
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:05,170
it's just kind of above and beyond what
you would do absolutely if you have a

139
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:09,579
username throw it in Google and see what
you get for results but there are no

140
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:14,709
search engines built specifically for
user names that are trying to do

141
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:21,459
something as well so just in this
example we'll try this one looked for

142
00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:52,160
your domain names that are available

143
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:58,370
everything's available that's a
ridiculous username and it starts to go

144
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,390
through a bunch of really popular sites
to do so you can see everything else on

145
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:05,380
here the idea behind this particular one
is as it is lying to you if it's greyed

146
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,700
out that user name is already in
existence at that particular site or

147
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:14,209
service the ones that are not great out
it's still available if you're doing

148
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:17,469
your own thing right if you're trying to
figure out where your username is trying

149
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:22,010
to use something that somebody else may
have already you know it's not get up

150
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,470
everywhere so you know for this
particular this particular site also

151
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:32,200
links click on the Instagram 1 I'll take
you straight to his page mister James of

152
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,399
course the leader of the south east
movement and takes like a bajillion

153
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:49,480
pictures of his head in the exact same
position for I don't know why wouldn't

154
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,699
you

155
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:53,699
fantastic

156
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:07,079
example framework you know take the
information you have

157
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:10,879
figure out which category is most
appropriate for it dive into that

158
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:12,069
category

159
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:17,550
the tools that are listed in there and
start to populated and go from there

160
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:38,700
images images are made one of my
favorites so I these off the internet to

161
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:43,460
put in my slides because obviously for a
number of reasons I can't use any images

162
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:50,830
I found while doing some work for my
clients but let's just say you know that

163
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:55,800
you've won when your report include
needs of the targets girlfriend ur

164
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:02,870
images it's it's unreal the amount of
things that I found that are absolutely

165
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:09,060
like emotionally or more morally
compromising for a particular target is

166
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,729
wonderful absolutely makes my day

167
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:17,950
absolutely every time it will make my
job fun so that's going to so really how

168
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:21,420
you can use this to there's a bunch of
great tools in the framework for doing

169
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:26,439
image searching reverse image search and
his fantastic I'm sure most people know

170
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,160
what that is but if you don't actually
take the image itself if you find it

171
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,339
somewhere else and then you'd be
uploading the image to a search engine

172
00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:37,570
and is looking for everywhere else that
image has been found

173
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:41,140
that's fantastic right track a
particular person you know search for

174
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:45,430
their avatars that they got like their
avatar posted somewhere on a forum or

175
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:51,099
website it's a good way everywhere the
really really spanned coverage on a

176
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,089
particular target they might have you
know one user name that you found one

177
00:15:55,089 --> 00:15:59,500
form one place and then that usually
comes up with almost nothing else I go

178
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,790
and take the guy's avatar search for his
avatar and found in other forums where

179
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:07,060
he's used the exact same avatar and
something similar to the user name right

180
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:12,410
now couple of numbers changed ur really
greatly greatly greatly expand the

181
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:20,040
results are getting metadata images to
is fantastic it's wonderful

182
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:24,930
so a lot of sites now of the popular
like social networking sites Facebook

183
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:30,209
and Craigslist and stuff there stripping
out metadata for people and don't do

184
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:37,420
that themselves but you know so this
this images from Craigslist and I've

185
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,378
done this example before

186
00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:43,939
years ago right found two guys on a bike
and it was a picture of it out sitting

187
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:46,719
in front of his garage it was really
small ones in there on the bike and you

188
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,869
couldn't see much but this was before
Craigslist started stripping the

189
00:16:49,869 --> 00:16:54,459
meditative download the pictures look at
the metadata rise location date is in

190
00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:57,758
their court up on Google Maps take a
look at it yet that's the exact same

191
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:03,459
garages in the in the picture and you
know I was a win right that the report

192
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:07,549
was success so now that they're starting
to the website so starting automatically

193
00:17:07,549 --> 00:17:11,429
do that for them you know you just have
to try harder right so take this picture

194
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:16,199
of the boat so I know he's got his phone
number on there i text the most hey man

195
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:20,579
very interested in your boat like to
know more about it I'm not at my

196
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:24,459
computer really quick can you send me a
picture of it again so he text me the

197
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:29,389
picture that he ever to grace list right
now have admitted giving occasion

198
00:17:29,389 --> 00:17:41,199
involved now I know where it's parked so
I was is so it turns out this was

199
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,990
actually like a boat restoration place
that sold used boats also and after that

200
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:53,139
image and image data actually matched
did you see the little bit of a phone

201
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:56,879
number up in there and the image
restoration place in the phone number

202
00:17:56,879 --> 00:18:02,219
match with a location data so either way
people

203
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:09,000
telephone numbers cell phone numbers or
are there probably my new favorite thing

204
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,259
almost entirely because of mobile
numbers now everything is going to cell

205
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:17,620
phones everything is a belated at the
Mobile related so and it's like

206
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,799
apparently when we decided to make
everything on mobile phones we forgot

207
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,120
everything we've ever done about
application security all over again so

208
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:29,830
we're starting from scratch so yeah

209
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:49,230
framework for telephone numbers right
this is one trying to give some examples

210
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:55,460
of it very important before you're
trying to do any sort of research

211
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,690
project you know take a look at the
tools in there and learn what learn them

212
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,770
learn how they operate search for
yourself

213
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:06,910
search for some other you know willing
participant in legal stuff or or don't

214
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,520
it's fine I'll stop you

215
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:17,790
crime doesn't pay was a liar track
criminals for job and they make money so

216
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:23,100
crime is basically the moral of the
story

217
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:39,150
yeah sure that's fine by me right turns
out I'm not hard to find their go to

218
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,190
three weeks ago

219
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:45,350
weekend and board should have been
working on my talk but of course like I

220
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:50,760
said I'm lazy so I didn't want a little
bit of fun entertainment so you know you

221
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:59,160
do what everybody does at the time in
Craigslist to see what's available so I

222
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:05,380
found my friend candy here she's offers
a companionship some reason she really

223
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:13,350
likes roses do something about her booty
for groceries for 40 roses and I didn't

224
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:16,600
really know why you would want to do
that but

225
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:24,850
you know I went with it so I got your
phone number did a little research on my

226
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:32,379
oh my my friendly companion here candy
and then give her a call she says hi

227
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:41,430
Andy know how can I help and yeah so I
responded back to her and when I said hi

228
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:45,840
Amanda conversation got awkward really
fast

229
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:57,860
know how I knew her name and told her I
knew she was how we're aware that I know

230
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:02,110
where from and I said well you know it's
we went to Cedar Ridge High School each

231
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:07,929
other you know remember as you start to
get a little bit more concerned about

232
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:13,430
the number and then when I said that you
know her mom gave it to me she really

233
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:20,020
freaked out and then hung up candy candy
didn't want to be my friend and

234
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,500
companion

235
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:28,830
I was sad happy

236
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:43,918
roses do but not those roses example
right knee injury can get this win over

237
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,330
quicker but basic idea someone selling
jewellery absolutely no information

238
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,710
about that the phone number

239
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:54,889
open amber take a look you find all
kinds of the carrier is you find out the

240
00:21:54,889 --> 00:22:02,830
city eventually find all your way down
to email addresses and they obviously

241
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:05,779
there's on their engagement ring and
wedding rings so you know they're

242
00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:06,690
getting a divorce

243
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:28,820
user names on it is also fantastic and
going to be another one of the common

244
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:33,928
ones getting email address as a bunch of
emails specific goals in here searching

245
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:37,960
for it everywhere you can find you know
sometimes you end up with nothing but a

246
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:44,999
lot of times you do get information is
the other tools get lucky and win the

247
00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:55,580
jackpot the picture book so you never
know what you're gonna find the whole

248
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,649
point of this you know it when you're
when you're developing some of the stuff

249
00:22:58,649 --> 00:23:02,330
and write reports it is really
interesting when you can add all that

250
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:05,460
extra details about the person you know
when you can start to talk about who

251
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:10,379
they are with their family is a friends
relationships they have what they have

252
00:23:10,379 --> 00:23:18,570
Amazon's great for how these great so
hypothetical situation and say I had a

253
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:25,549
talk with my friend bob had a target and
doing his thing as bob does does some

254
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:30,129
research on the target find the e-mail
address is also happens to find the

255
00:23:30,129 --> 00:23:31,709
targets wife's email address

256
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:38,730
runs it through the doors in the
framework a couple things but had to do

257
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:42,759
is report nothing too exciting runs are
on the email addresses

258
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:47,470
just to see if any of them and register
for stuff or sign up for a wish list

259
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:57,879
turns out bob's targets wife email
address did indeed have a wish list so

260
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:07,450
we pulled up and you find that his wife
and plus size strap on harness on Amazon

261
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,960
wish list

262
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:16,000
putting a report that that bob probably
has the target probably has a hobby of

263
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:33,890
making maybe maybe not so I'm lesion
mobile emulation that's a really fancy

264
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:40,040
mobile apps are fun right we've done
everything about how security works

265
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,030
because mobile is a brand new
environment and why should we repeat

266
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:45,430
things that we've learned the hard way

267
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:51,980
mobile app syrupy their overpowered holy
crap so a lot of sites social networks

268
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,700
and stuff are starting to try and get a
little bit better with privacy and

269
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,500
things

270
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,610
find somebody's phone number or email
address and try to search for in a

271
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:02,270
particular social network you may or may
not get results even if they have a

272
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:09,290
profile registered and tied to that
address or phone number is could be due

273
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:15,580
to it usually do the person's privacy
settings on their profile with most

274
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:19,189
people right you're gonna you're gonna
get it right away because people are

275
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:23,290
dumb and they don't care what other
times you people have their privacy

276
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:27,540
settings with a bit more luck down and
you search for something and you know it

277
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:31,330
sucks to not find stuff especially if
you try writing the report but they

278
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:36,850
don't have facebook facebook facebook is
like the gold mine

279
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,939
right that's what ties everything
together and you know you've got

280
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:48,040
everything in the person so mobile apps
are really together turns out if you a

281
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:55,060
mobile app mobile phone and install all
the favorite social network you know you

282
00:25:55,060 --> 00:26:01,190
name it snapped at Facebook there's a
bajillion for getting social networks

283
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:07,840
out there that are stupid highly
specific those on your your emulated

284
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,899
mobile phone and then take whatever
contact details you have for that

285
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:17,600
particular person and and put it in your
contacts for your phone and you say

286
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:24,070
despite my friends look at my contacts
those guys get their contact information

287
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:28,919
already in his phone clearly they must
be real life friends to bypass all that

288
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:33,790
privacy stuff in the search and old
person for a while if any way obviously

289
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:40,860
we're friends or make contact with all
of them there's a fair number that it

290
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:50,399
does and it just let you right in the
morning documentation right for working

291
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,530
through the framework right there's a
stupid amount of tools in there you're

292
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:58,790
gonna find a just and reasonable amount
of information on whatever you're part

293
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:04,030
of the documentation becomes critical
quickly because I worked on that big old

294
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:08,120
mess of a mind map I started trying to
do some documentation and my maps is

295
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,260
it's working alright I'm not sure if
it's someone to stick with what I

296
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:15,580
basically took my major categories for
the mind map and left it as my default

297
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:22,040
documentation template and then as I
find new details as I find the IP

298
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:28,670
address or URL or whatever i just drop
into the categories so I can track it

299
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:33,360
all you're gonna get overwhelmed how
much stuff you can find most important

300
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,260
thing here too is as you're doing this
come up with some way for you to

301
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,920
to identify or mark the information that
you've already completed research on the

302
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,240
stuff you haven't cause you're going to
start with an e-mail address into all

303
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:53,970
the date on it and plain cream or emails
usernames or websites or ticket thing

304
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:57,390
and then you start looking at your
documentation again and you know I've

305
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:59,710
got a email addresses

306
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:06,040
search all the way for or maybe other
one is just gets confusing right so

307
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,940
markedly different color fight check
blog figure something out that works for

308
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:16,870
you to mark what actual data points
research on a lot of folks out that I

309
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:21,260
know this sort of work just capture all
the time

310
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:26,670
nothing sucks more than finding just the
goldmine of information for whoever your

311
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:31,340
target is and not documenting it moving
on and then going back in finding the

312
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:35,129
deleted their Twitter account got banned
and you can get that information anymore

313
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:44,550
that sucks a lot and lazy and don't
document properly huntley is another

314
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:51,919
awesome thing that actually the right
now it's not mine but it may be another

315
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,580
guy who does a lot of awesome work with
Python

316
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:01,030
a lot of open source intelligence stuff
I highly recommend you check that one

317
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:08,000
how it's the only thing that I've got in
here that's not a free and its purchase

318
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,350
but what he's done is basically built
for the browser that will track and

319
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:19,959
record it on and off the track and
record everything that you're doing your

320
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:27,750
research project and then drops it all
into a easily searchable dashboard

321
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:35,770
just fine sir the text you're looking
for an image's it's like it saves a lot

322
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:47,090
of those oops moments where you see a
bunch of cool stuff you hear some fans

323
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:53,100
in this two presentations find a bunch
of location data points out on Google

324
00:29:53,100 --> 00:30:03,580
Maps or something and throw that in
there so much quick examples for the

325
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:07,020
kinds of tools and things that are in
the framework right way more than I'm

326
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:12,690
able to cover in the presentation the
idea behind this is this is this is new

327
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:17,710
at like to get out and try to get some
feedback on it yet some folks try to

328
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:22,500
start to use it and you let me know what
they think about it too well there's

329
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:27,950
basically three major ideas behind right
now in terms of use on the website which

330
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:34,420
showed you guys already another one is
it helps I that's got JSON files which

331
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:40,060
is basically just all the bookmarks for
all the links that are in the website so

332
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:44,230
basically you just go and take the JSON
file imported directing your browser and

333
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:51,670
have all the bookmarks local tu their
third one that is extension we got

334
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:54,520
really bad coding so this for me was

335
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:59,440
a long-term goal and not something that
I had any intention of having ready for

336
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:09,330
Carolina com helps to have smart friends
so report last presentation last night

337
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:15,060
he actually talking him just about to
try to get some development ideas

338
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:23,550
development retardedness off a little
bit give us some other stuff going a bit

339
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:29,110
faster talked about this extension
little bit and i guess i couldnt sleep

340
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:35,590
in and with the other starter virgin
forests or chrome extension so idea

341
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:40,449
behind this and it's also thinking
enough for it so like I said though it

342
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:46,640
is not even version 1 there's a lot more
a lot more ideas that we have things we

343
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:51,730
want to do with it and I got it stops
working so hard coding so I can help out

344
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:55,700
more instead of making for mass idea
behind the Chrome extension was really

345
00:31:55,700 --> 00:32:03,740
the website is quick reference right you
can do anything he did find a quick tool

346
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:07,870
for a certain category jump on the
website find it and use it and move on

347
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:11,719
right but if you do research on a
day-to-day basis where you can spend a

348
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,100
lot of hours

349
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:17,530
diving into a specific thing to me the
more usable format was the local

350
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:23,350
bookmarks you know so important the JSON
file and have that local but when I was

351
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:27,659
thinking about it like you lots that's
good but realistically thinking about

352
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:31,530
somebody else using it to do it somebody
else with this out and I were to go grab

353
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,540
those bookmarks

354
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:40,200
maybe this is just me with my name again
but it's I'm gonna go up there to win

355
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,090
I'm trying to search for things

356
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:45,750
and the tools are all broken your dad or
whatever its eighteen months down the

357
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:49,940
road and I'm frustrated I should go find
out if things got updates and there's

358
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:55,409
been no 300 update since last time I did
it so here is really the idea behind

359
00:32:55,409 --> 00:32:59,190
fixing that problem you know something
that you can install have local have

360
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:04,470
automatic opinion right so as new tools
coming to the framework that

361
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:07,320
automatically will populate inside of
your browser

362
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:12,570
have search capability inside of it and
be able to you know look for a certain

363
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:22,120
to wear certain to more ideas that we
want to get in here and hopefully really

364
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:27,270
kinda cranky go to start to work towards
automation on some of the stuff as well

365
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:37,950
but that's that's work too so it's
really going to drive the direction of

366
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:46,230
where hours are spent on improving this
some other ideas where we have on the

367
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:50,190
to-do list for the Chrome extension
would be allowed for other tools

368
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:56,460
suggestions from the extension itself up
on get home so yeah absolutely willing

369
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:00,539
to send a follow request if you've got a
bunch of other sites and tools I don't

370
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:07,460
have listed some of that as well as so
what the way the Chrome extension works

371
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:13,649
a little better as I can go into work is
basically just looks on in your

372
00:34:13,649 --> 00:34:19,219
bookmarks file to see if there's a
folder called for you know that we come

373
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:24,908
from work if you don't have only one for
you and drops in their simple and basic

374
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:32,280
today the unfortunate issue with that at
the moment is it makes it hard for you

375
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,710
do that and then you have a tool that
fits in here that's not in the framework

376
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:45,609
of the categories but that makes the
updating of its not hard to set up at

377
00:34:45,609 --> 00:34:48,489
some point here to be able to ignore
your own customizations and bookmarks

378
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:52,098
and then offer suggestions

379
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:59,349
else wants to know but that too maybe I
don't know depends on feedback how much

380
00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:07,559
other folks and its rating system for
tools and resources some descriptions of

381
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:12,619
them and specializations I think that
the bottom part is especially for a lot

382
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:17,430
of these sites the whole focus is
everything in here right now none of

383
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:19,109
these resources costs money

384
00:35:19,109 --> 00:35:23,700
a lot of them are what I premium which
is a few teaser data search for

385
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:29,470
something you get a little better
results back and where you can have a

386
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,720
complete background check

387
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,769
pay the money I don't ever do that

388
00:35:34,369 --> 00:35:37,650
think you should either is enough
resources out there we were all that

389
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:42,920
information for free anyway that's right
it's the descriptions would really help

390
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:48,229
with that right to get through their
premium stuff and then automation writes

391
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:53,499
this is phase one automation is really
was honestly where I wanted to go from

392
00:35:53,499 --> 00:35:57,718
the beginning of this but when I started
looking at all of it I realized that

393
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:02,400
aggregation tools and resources in a
format that wasn't the complete disaster

394
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,249
that I hadn't already we really had to
be step one starting work on some

395
00:36:07,249 --> 00:36:11,919
automation stuff now that the stuff is
in at least a workable format and it's

396
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,950
simple right I mean I just saw the only
thing that we've started to do or have

397
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:19,089
done so far it's been like the
JavaScript bookmarklet for the user

398
00:36:19,089 --> 00:36:23,729
names so if you basically allows for you
to highlight some of his username want

399
00:36:23,729 --> 00:36:28,180
the bookmarklet automatically open all
of these themes search engines and take

400
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:32,399
the highlighted text as input and
automatic this role that you'll end up

401
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,440
with an open tabs with the content
already searched for the research for

402
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,700
the paper out any data you need to
document and then

403
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:47,850
so what does start and what I wanna do I
want to do a lot more of that automation

404
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:52,759
for you know i meeting the search pieces
at least and then eventually can

405
00:36:52,760 --> 00:37:02,830
automate data collection and of it as
well that's so please use it and

406
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:05,830
feedback on anything absolutely anything

407
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:10,080
organizations thoughts only the word for
the departed whatever it is

408
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:15,410
other automation ideas as you're using
it tell me what you're paying points are

409
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:19,660
right the intention of this is to make
doing these types of projects easier if

410
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,430
there are still other pain points you
know maybe it's not something I can fix

411
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:25,540
right away but maybe that's where
something needs to needs to be written

412
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:33,600
permission I love that we finally have a
to-do list a mile long through it so

413
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:40,029
much wraps up my presentation and ask
questions fire away I i mean I'll be

414
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:44,040
around all weekend too so please
introduce yourself lots of talk about

415
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:59,790
this and other ideas and turn it around
for the next time the next time I have

416
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:04,580
been told that he's going to give a talk
this arvo he plans to drop heaps of good

417
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:09,759
oil about reversing iOS apps before he
goes and hits the Terps so I am no

418
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,550
friggin idea what any of that means but
maybe by the end of the next time we'll

419
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:18,670
have a better idea yeah that's it

420
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:21,670
any questions

421
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:28,780
I would imagine highly offensive by your
problem I can't understand it

422
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:51,180
website called me being all friendly and
you know new client what ever wanted to

423
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:56,569
know how the website was told me look
fancy asked if I designed it not always

424
00:38:56,570 --> 00:39:02,190
though all of it didn't know how to
handle that and then asked me what it

425
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:07,590
was and I told them that I was a tool
for knocking people that led to an

426
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:12,540
interesting conversation I had a high
suspicion my website was not going to be

427
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:18,590
any more until I moved it again so the
thing right it's gonna happen it's

428
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:23,890
shitty that happens to you but that's
the comes back to typical security

429
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:26,710
problems right people need to learn to
not be done with their data on the

430
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:31,580
internet it's with all the data breaches
going on because you can't control that

431
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:44,290
that's going to happen and it's it's
it's really hard to prevent against it

432
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:50,009
that's the whole thing so I've got a
couple of things that I consider doing

433
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:54,370
in terms of trying to make boxing card
early against myself haven't done any of

434
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:59,230
them and care that much so there are
absolutely things you can do to get your

435
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:04,130
your footprint on the Internet to be
less already out there you know some

436
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:10,230
sites and stuff will pull data down its
hard a lot of them or do it really the

437
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:17,620
best method there is populating data go
sign up for a bunch of things under your

438
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:27,870
real name so that data advertisers when
you look up for your name on some of

439
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:31,990
these things and certainly see that
there's no 45 of you in six different

440
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:35,660
states it makes it harder for somebody
trying to

441
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:40,460
that has you as a target pulled out
which date is actually real your did

442
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:44,020
your real data will still be there but
which one is the real Deena

443
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:11,430
breath over debt problem right it's
what's my workflow on it and I'm gonna

444
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:16,990
say it really depends on my time that's
that's really good to me if I take my

445
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:21,779
have a username or a particular data
point do I search that to you know to

446
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:26,980
the end and document all the additional
data points that I found on it before I

447
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:31,970
move into those other categories and
other tools or do I you know kind of

448
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:35,500
spin through is really gonna depend on
my time and how much time you spend on

449
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:39,750
it my preference would be did you know
that when completely I have a username

450
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:45,240
lost all my possible research effort on
it and then move on to the next thing I

451
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:58,020
media's how that almost never happens
too much time you have any else I some

452
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,170
later feel free to talk on
