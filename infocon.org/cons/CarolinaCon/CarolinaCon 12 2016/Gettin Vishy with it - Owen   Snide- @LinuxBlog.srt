reason to have a plan B because it
direct from planning a so my plan B is

14
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:31,950
there's a bunch of blue sippy cups up
here if anyone wants to come and get a

15
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:43,850
coke or sprite and coke and then there's
lemon should definitely grab one is only

16
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,539
50 cops don't show up at once

17
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:56,940
this is going to take a few minutes

18
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:09,400
in an assembly line I was gonna get
Captain Morgan lime bite because my so

19

sometimes so it's gonna make a lime

20
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:21,690
lemon coke like lemons good enough as
the bottle was twice the size yes

21
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,690
everybody who is 21

22
00:02:31,150 --> 00:03:12,159
2016 was gonna have imposes a party
because he already did it and everything

23
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:20,069
like added element moved into security
pretty much since the first Carolina

24
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:28,319
called have had two kids there is one of
my children with a telephone really

25
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:35,798
going to avoid always been interested in
that stuff with it for a long time but

26
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:46,829
really interested in security over
one-half years ago I don't like long

27
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:48,230
walks on the beach

28
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:53,590
mighty ride my bike can try when I fall
outside generally dream I don't like the

29
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:59,209
word cyber cuz if you're on the internet
for the year 2009 means something

30
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:01,040
completely different

31
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:09,340
but it is what is so what is this
actually about it if you here by

32
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:19,139
accident so we were gonna talk about
this in the lower half of it but after I

33
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:22,610
saw Patrick presentation what how many
years ago that two years ago

34
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:29,060
two years ago we did a presentation on
foreign for with no really interesting

35
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:36,199
people use this kind of work with him on
some stuff and that's what we're talking

36
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:44,099
about so I do is fishing fishing
smashing informing on the butcher this

37
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:52,969
interchange these words that fishing is
what we gonna cover first everybody

38
00:04:52,970 --> 00:05:00,560
generators were fishing is sending out
emails or somebody said no he was joking

39
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,180
as you get those who that is if you
don't know what fishing is great and we

40
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:11,970
can go into more depth but when asked
people what are you talking about you

41
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,099
say this you had somebody say oh you
mean fishing as a no I mean fishing

42
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:21,770
boats fishing so according to Google is
the act of using telephone and to scare

43
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,270
me user into surrendering private
information that will be used for

44
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:29,570
identity theft scam I usually tend to be
able to commit business improves the

45
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:37,360
victim in profit as pretty good
definition I like the Wikipedia slightly

46
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,930
more in detail they say it's a criminal
practice which pretty much if you're

47
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:50,070
doing it legally for legal reasons and
there is a criminal practice goes on to

48
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,070
mention that using social engineering
which

49
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:00,260
gain access to private person financial
information sometimes referred to as he

50
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:06,570
sings it says some fraudsters use voice
over IP I don't know I think pretty much

51
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:12,320
the majority probably are using them now
since hard lines are gonna be at the

52
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,349
track and it says some people use IPOs
which we gained 20 you know what it

53
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:29,090
boils down to is it it's rolled right
people were gathering scams in farming

54
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:36,460
in the same concept for smashing he said
these SMS messages or missed messages in

55
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:41,200
farming is a new term I hadn't heard of
one of those articles ahead of those

56
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:52,080
times in its I guess installing malware
kind of lames terms the everything has

57
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:59,520
two overtimes see recently I heard
wailing to you which apparently is your

58
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,039
targeting one person proud of this kind
of stupid

59
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:13,880
how high profile here are you trying to
get your big prize what it saids really

60
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,320
be here at school

61
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:24,810
everything has to have a look at some
statistics so it's an image graph that

62
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:29,040
two thousand and seven between 4 2007
kind of peaked

63
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:40,440
Stock Market Ticker not really a whole
eight times higher and when they started

64
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:49,900
down so the next 10 years ago has been a
steady decline fishing and fishing so

65
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:57,419
everybody seems to fish fishing is
there's a lot more search falling for

66
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:02,820
people know what it is I guess from the
news outlets and stuff and fishing is

67
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:07,310
barely a blip on that line 33

68
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:18,889
so maybe the problem is you know people
on using the tone fishing so and that

69
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:24,099
looks like that that's the problem
understood using a thirty time but then

70
00:08:24,099 --> 00:08:25,340
when you step back

71
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:31,229
fishing again that the bars do so as to
the likelihood is not the case

72
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:39,699
regional interests this is all friends
there's free areas of interest this

73
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:46,609
India the United States interest to me i
didnt see Nigeria on there anything

74
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:56,490
going on in country 49 no interest maybe
the use a different language just search

75
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:07,820
for enemies of cities to London New
Delhi Mumbai Bangalore 150 I don't know

76
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,720
why this is the search for him for that

77
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:19,899
who is this is the regional interest in
India as I don't know how the sailor so

78
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:30,339
Maharashtra Maharashtra so anyone know
what city is there a giveaway in the

79
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:36,760
earlier flight if you can even read them
is formally known as Bombay in United

80
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:44,079
States Texas and California I'm
surprised over Carolina doesn't show up

81
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:47,079
on that because it's like I'm Google in
every day

82
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:59,430
entering and obviously is under percent
was coming from london is pretty much

83
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:03,109
the same as you phishing schemes you got
your new malware tech support which is

84
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:06,380
everybody's heard of this right you get
a phone call

85
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:16,560
and so modest too beautiful you thinking
reward codes of those interesting ones

86
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,680
is a jury duty been selected for jury
duty please give me a social so I can

87
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:28,829
verify that they would say an American
accent hopefully maybe not calling cards

88
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:36,360
people turn again to make it with the
click cause of people in prison system

89
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:53,960
to go ahead and put your credit card
info so you can get free home security

90
00:10:53,960 --> 00:11:03,120
system one that's a big one area and
then if you actually talk to the people

91
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:11,400
I've got two of those calls today I was
hoping they are going to win any areas

92
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,579
ok where do you live as it were you said
you were doing in my area you should

93
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:23,780
know where I live but they just want me
to go ahead and same three-month bills

94
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:30,030
and a credit card and everything nothing
can go wrong with a school for free

95
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:34,630
security system say they may be
legitimate I took it pretty much

96
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:41,530
everything telephone voices is a vicious
killer this is a bonuses texts coming up

97
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:45,339
and then to have been seeing whats
people prepare for this image was from

98
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:50,880
next door which is one of those
community things and some 13 this was in

99
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:58,340
my neighborhood or area said hey iris is
coming and people just comment on that

100
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:07,200
one of those caused other applications
that we can use this forest Estes use it

101
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,160
for gathering one time passes two factor
authentication is some of those games

102
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,420
out there in the world

103
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:21,770
like somebody requests or reset your
password and they made me do this

104
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:29,140
mission to try and get that type of
thing conferencing services is some ways

105
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,970
and we should look at if you're
interested

106
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:39,720
Patrick's presentation on fraud or
services and we're only 13 minutes in

107
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:51,550
which was my plan be so how do they do
it was trying to do a one of those 22 so

108
00:12:51,550 --> 00:13:00,290
wherever lansford I couldn't make it
work said noting that research hopefully

109
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:07,180
they do a recent gathering of
advertising agencies that have a wave

110
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:13,359
formation by volume just dial a bunch of
people you know there's plenty of fish

111
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,240
in the sea let's hope that we get
someone on technical side they probably

112
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:24,850
gonna spoofs the quarry they may be no
obviously call may be compromised

113
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:32,850
someone's BB external calls sally is as
test is how would you go about sitting

114
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:42,150
here saying that the suspect is
researcher target under $1 give him a

115
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:51,480
call and since you're legitimate thing
you could register receipt for what

116
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,720
shows up on the caller ID's and
hopefully around for somebody without

117
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:11,220
spoke about spoofing or you can change

118
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:38,839
people can use to the bar for testing
phishing schemes and make it easy to use

119
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:45,120
make it easy to self and your targets in
campaigns reporting that disturbs me

120
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:51,660
Patrick did for any business in 2015 and
then expanded on the idea that they

121
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:59,870
thought about it and he did his business
was immeasurable backgrounds and how

122
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:06,170
many people did insecurities its ships
that kinda stuff but the idea was

123
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:10,459
sitting at a bar we would use as a spoof
inquiry see what comes out is what it

124
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:16,719
tastes like already and it says
voicemail that was pretty cool sorry

125
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,160
wrong number was kinda freaking
background and I developed an IVR we

126
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,770
could dial into it and do some of this
stuff

127
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:35,970
expand on it today is not much of these
since there you can use me to you which

128
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:40,200
is playing was in doubt it's not really
freaking

129
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:47,589
its it was catchy name I like this store
on house phone systems work do your

130
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:54,329
testing if you are authorized to do that
test your offences defenses you mentally

131
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:59,160
test your clients if they were late
maybe you can was case scenario is it

132
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:08,250
for printing your friends as long as you
don't intend to harm them right so it's

133
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,120
pretty simple

134
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:16,610
this is really just a little boxes
Debian an asterisk is number one there's

135
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:22,149
the biggest tendency to you is to rest
interface which are route is not using

136
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:26,920
asterisks interface at the moment you
plan on changing that I had here in Nova

137
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:33,779
resting place to some reason I don't
know why I guess I didn't building it

138
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:42,630
and I didn't know exists which is really
Stephen but it's it handles the talking

139
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:50,550
between like the clients and assets he
makes it a lot easier to use users slim

140
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:54,500
frame working PHP all of the clarence
used to rest in peace

141
00:16:55,050 --> 00:17:04,129
set for the dialing in to face cuz they
want to make the same mistake they've

142
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:10,220
made and say I hope when I just drank a
bunch of alcohol which had done today

143
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:19,900
but the source code is in just upset you
can grab it and that would have a

144
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:27,880
vagrant just pretty much makes it easy
to provision machines and religious

145
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:37,880
groups from there and the biggest up the
this one is women face only 20 minutes

146
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:46,140
in his car driven by interest them so
much of it recently cuz lost interest

147
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:57,260
myself I've been really busy and lots of
people been busy got some demos I was

148
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,260
going to live there was within a
foreigner that's a really bad idea

149
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:06,178
sacrifice any I'm going into the works
reliably

150
00:18:15,570 --> 00:19:37,000
I didn't get up and then run Windows
favorite is but it just doesn't work the

151
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,350
way I have it set up in the moment but
it does run OSX too so if you have

152
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:47,439
Windows install Ubuntu on it or
something from there but you can't do

153
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:56,320
nvm nvm doesn't like the MTV Jams so
once you've logged in

154
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,020
that far I've already done on this one
so it doesn't take quite as long it's

155
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:09,710
going to cause of error messages of you
were he thought it was assigned and so

156
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,930
it's up and running you can use it

157
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:18,350
one you got in and soapy or astor's term
there will be documentation on how to do

158
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,980
that

159
00:20:19,980 --> 00:21:20,929
the next and this is a call to the REST
API just for the localhost upstairs and

160
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:52,770
that's made a call we can actually get
cool I don't know what their business

161
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,770
actually is drugs

162
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:07,900
I haven't called Jackie allegorical be
like to be something it could be yes it

163
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:18,220
is I didn't raise no credit for it

164
00:22:39,080 --> 00:23:08,740
pretty much a recording

165
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:56,030
happy thats you can sneak peek of that
there is new as of Monday I needed

166
00:24:56,030 --> 00:25:03,530
something that I was originally gonna
work on it when you go call please enter

167
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:11,240
your password again there was not enough
time to do it even though I have

168
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:26,570
Quicktime

169
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:51,360
so I'm said of exploit a report saying
this is this makes it so much easier I

170
00:25:51,360 --> 00:26:00,280
don't know why evident do this to begin
with but you can choose your recording

171
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,580
and this makes it so much easier because
eventually you will be at play

172
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:09,639
recordings and possibly even record your
recordings on a web interface and then

173
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:15,690
push it to the server serbian targets
and this is a javascript there is there

174
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:30,790
even a single target or you can go over
the targets of one group delay I

175
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:34,010
couldn't get it working it was
disappointing so I figured I'd leave it

176
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:38,530
in there but it doesn't work then
there's a report that is one of the

177
00:26:54,909 --> 00:27:02,789
look at this moment free mind

178
00:27:54,570 --> 00:28:21,070
no idea what is the proper permissions
for the box as it stands is super

179
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:29,139
insecure because it I just chmod
everything 4777 to get them as we know

180
00:28:29,139 --> 00:28:33,408
is a very regime is for development is
never intended to be put in a production

181
00:28:33,409 --> 00:28:41,120
environment they do what you will get
their intern certify the web

182
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:52,508
obviously there needs proper interface
is not acceptable to go in to see if if

183
00:28:52,509 --> 00:28:59,519
they decide to keep it will be ported
rest it doesn't make sense to maintain

184
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:06,240
control of code problems is probably the
biggest world

185
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,440
in the second biggest thing to hang in
there is bridging audio city you can

186
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:22,340
kind of patch people in so you can see
start doing the digits with the problem

187
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:27,500
in the NCAA transfer to representative
in their verify the information that

188
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:32,590
might be difficult I don't use a
database is that a flat files there are

189
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:38,699
things that have flat files that would
probably be a good thing to do I mean

190
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:46,570
its rapid application development
defending against phishing because once

191
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:51,770
probably our awareness and education
making people where water is or is not

192
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:59,720
answering phone calls wanting somebody
else said it was in his own way said oh

193
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:04,080
that's why I accept calls from any
number don't know they didn't leave a

194
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,760
voicemail

195
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,350
a pretty good idea testing that's
probably a good way to defend against

196
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,709
something see what happens

197
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:22,100
verification validation is what I came
into you recently way so I had to do

198
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:26,840
something and it was kind of sense to
what they do on the website was they

199
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:31,139
give you say that we will not contact
you unless you have this phrase or

200
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:36,070
saying this is anything you don't hear
that and you're not speaking to one of

201
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:41,399
our people that's actually a great way
to end it but then I think you can

202
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,100
actually choose your own possible
reasons that all manner of you so much

203
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,100
fun to have an agency say something

204
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:07,660
other ways you could if anyone's heard
of Lenny this is a great project we have

205
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:17,450
audio jack

206
00:31:43,660 --> 00:32:27,000
recording solo back he's made it so you
called forward your calls to any more

207
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,010
because people would just falling
everybody to it

208
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:39,650
as a shame if you want if you are
already and you go to I think / call me

209
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:45,000
maybe or its lending you can request and
if you ever phones aw poor people do it

210
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:37,349
do we have any questions or seriously is
there any questions arose right provided

211
00:34:37,349 --> 00:34:46,139
the question was how do you access the
phone or what you do is at the core you

212
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:53,149
said there are just too many questions
we got plenty of time

213
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:44,299
development
