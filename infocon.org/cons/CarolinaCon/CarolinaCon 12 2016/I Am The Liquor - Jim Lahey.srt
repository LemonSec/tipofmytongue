1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:22,640
I'm generally exactly what I do worry is
that I needed during practice so I'm the

2
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:31,470
supervisor for the study about trailer
park and was a former police officer of

3
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:38,170
work and go on a diet 11 here one of my
clean jokes here anyway what are the

4
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:44,539
generous say when he jumped out of the
closet why now

5
00:00:46,940 --> 00:01:02,030
licorice and I the only way I can do the
entire talking and Lori so Carolina con

6
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:08,760
I am suffered a part of Charlotte
hackers anonymous and I wanted to talk a

7
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,070
little bit about

8
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:17,820
and my methodology how I do it manually
and eventually wanting to move it to an

9
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,919
automated solution I call them so we're
going to talk a little bit about that so

10
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,150
little bit about me I'm a certified
resistant anti apt professional very

11
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:35,240
nice certification have apt defender dot
com so if you're interested

12
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:44,619
very highly sought-after certification
CISSP squared they say the CISSP is a

13
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:49,960
mile wide and an inch deep this one is
also mile-deep intertwined

14
00:01:54,270 --> 00:02:00,490
co-founder of Charlotte hikers on missus
our group in Charlotte very similar to

15
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:05,860
2,600 group we help each other get
proper talks like this we talk about all

16
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:10,149
the different types of things related
and generally and in for second

17
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:19,239
conference but gotta bounce around all
over the place so just get an idea about

18
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:24,629
what I mean by perimeter which is going
through a quick recap of the perimeters

19
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:32,160
the outside internet facing part of an
organization so many organizations don't

20
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,549
realize what their perimeter actually
looks like so it could be a handful of

21
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:42,280
IP's are thousands of them and small
organizations actually don't understand

22
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,160
actual size of the footprint they could
start off with a small business class

23
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,069
girl over time and keeping that business
class and totally forget that it's even

24
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:56,319
there and and operating as they grow
whereas the opposite is true large

25
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,130
organizations a lot of large
organizations underestimate the size of

26
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:07,370
the perimeter and they leave a lot of
space undefended and this is in part due

27
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:11,769
to acquisitions and mergers a lot of
time you have all these acquisitions and

28
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:17,720
mergers mergers IP spaces that get
forgot about that can really cloudy

29
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:25,590
visibility of the actual perimeter so as
a red team member and I see right team

30
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:30,569
member were talking about the offensive
side of things that the organization

31
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:35,638
within the group within an organization
that is the attacker going out there and

32
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:42,680
finding weaknesses so why should we
perform for a recon well we need to make

33
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,590
sure that the scope that we've SPECT out
for testing is true and we're not gonna

34
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:52,389
be trampling on someone else's IP space
very important part of the process

35
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,860
you know when I accidentally go out and
scan something or attack something that

36
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:02,270
you don't own so scope their vacations
are very important very important step

37
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:09,040
of the penetration testing process as
red team where as the adversaries were

38
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,030
assessing Park targets of opportunity
for looking for that weakness in the

39
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:16,190
system that someone forgot about that
web server that's been sitting out there

40
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:21,290
since 1993 that someone forgot to turn
off those your foothold in here

41
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:28,280
organization so those systems can be
configured with weak security lot of

42
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:35,599
things could have default configurations
info credentials and in doing this type

43
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,250
of recon you can find a lot of space
that people forget about or were

44
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,730
neglected you find out a lot about your
organizations defensive side of things

45
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:50,440
as they often don't understand
completely what they need to be scanning

46
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:56,050
and so that that's an opportunity for
you to teach them as well so it switch

47
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,440
gears up to go the defensive side of
things why as a blue team the defending

48
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:06,830
groups part of an organization why do we
need to perform distribute or recon well

49
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:10,520
we're inspecting for weaknesses and
defenses are looking for those holes as

50
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,229
gas that we forgot to take care of

51
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:18,740
yes we've got our asses and our policy
in your set-up scanning all the IP space

52
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,870
that we think of but what did we miss
where are we not looking where we'd only

53
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:30,840
have visibility an example of an
assessment we used a method to do some

54
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,880
data exfiltration and came back and said
hey guys what did you see and they said

55
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,690
nothing as we have no visibility into
that environment to one of those

56
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:46,550
important things to to find it and help
remediate as gas so really what

57
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:51,500
important space that was lost or gained
mergers and acquisitions so not only

58
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,890
buying another company or having a
merging with another company and also

59
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:56,880
selling off

60
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,469
organizations what records are out there
that are accurate once ones need to be

61
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,470
corrected to for accuracy

62
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:11,990
scanning someone else's space are we
missing space to lack of research this

63
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:18,720
is important for the defensive side as
well as the methodology that I used

64
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,740
currently we had our shot hackers
Anonymous meeting last weekend we ran

65
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,730
through this talk with them

66
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:29,940
condo re-wrote some of this and kind of
work through this is how I do things now

67
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,510
and I'm always open to recommendations
and suggestions but as a defensive

68
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:40,250
goddesses what I've come up with a
review information and regional internet

69
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:45,180
registries will get a little bit more
into what those are as we proceed in

70
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:51,060
this talk for more information about the
organization's IP space you want to make

71
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,290
sure that any relevant mergers or
acquisitions have been accounted for

72
00:06:54,290 --> 00:07:00,750
when you do in your your recon work very
important step but I found out is

73
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,520
auditing for accuracy

74
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,030
a lot of times when year holy
information from places all around the

75
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,440
globe alot of different data points
you're gonna have information is

76
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,120
completely inaccurate or move somewhere
else so you have to really go through

77
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,750
and doing manual audit I haven't been
able to figure out a way to really

78
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:22,110
automate this more than going through
making sure that all the things that

79
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:26,470
you're gonna go after you actually are
in charge of you have permission to do

80
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:32,060
so many scan all the things and then
screenshot banner grab as much

81
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:37,640
information to look for these targets of
opportunity look for weaknesses in the

82
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:44,580
perimeter for just a little bit of
history just first time either not

83
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,729
familiar with how internet numbering
services came into existence diana was

84
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:55,800
the first one that came about 40 1987
after ARPANET had been maintained by a

85
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:01,230
sole person so I and it was formed to
manage the numbers assigned on the

86
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:05,270
internet and later and around 98 I can

87
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:09,539
took responsibility I and it was rolled
into that and so these these two

88
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,990
organizations control all of the IP
spaces that get allocated in the world

89
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:18,100
in a way that they do this obviously
there's going to be some political

90
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:22,980
boundaries are through these regional
internet registries and you can see this

91
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:27,190
map here you have different colors it
kinda correspond to the different

92
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:37,340
registries there and they're constantly
shifting landscape so the Middle East

93
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,850
and Africa actually been going through a
rear or where Africa used to take care

94
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:46,740
of part of the Middle East and now it's
been taken over by right which take care

95
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,780
of a lot of Asian Europe that'll become
relevant further my talk as to why

96
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:58,180
there's changes are important when
you're doing perimetry call so just an

97
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,810
example erin is the one we use in North
America that regional internet registry

98
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:07,810
this is one of Hilton Worldwide i didnt
im just gonna tell you right now that my

99
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:13,430
employer doesn't want me or I don't want
to discuss stuff with my player card

100
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:18,089
like the employee so many examples that
are redacted and some of the examples

101
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,990
that i'm gonna show you completely
redacted so that kind of protect that I

102
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,200
need to eat and obviously a good drink
as well

103
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:44,500
so this example elmore why'd you have
you noticed there there's a at the

104
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,910
bottom is a restful link so that's nice
there's an API there there's something

105
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:53,300
that we can go back to to actually carry
this data later and then the box at the

106
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:58,040
bottom of network resources and give
some information about part of the

107
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:03,170
network alone so that's just it's a very
broad example erin is a humongous data

108
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:07,620
bases a lot of data in there that can be
used for a perimeter recon and this is

109
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:14,920
just one example amongst all of the
regional internet registries now some of

110
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,300
the problems I found with regional
internet registries that the API like

111
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:25,770
him into it aaron is very stable very
comprehensive others aren't so much so

112
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:30,720
in working with this trying to figure
out a way to automate these searches

113
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,230
after nick has been ruled out since 2014

114
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,710
it's not really functioning properly and
I'm not a lot of other ones transfer

115
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:44,110
records in amongst themselves so there's
a lot of times you end up with the

116
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:49,300
search loop and give you example here's
one from Hilton and the admin and a tech

117
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:55,250
are a frenetic there and the remarks
this is data has been transferred from

118
00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:01,070
right through its database no problem
there is now we don't have actual good

119
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:04,070
data because now we're gonna have to go
back and find out okay what in this

120
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:09,490
database and right actually hold this
record so bring the API's a lot of times

121
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:13,450
when these records have been transferred
end up in a loop trying to find relevant

122
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:17,680
data and a lot of times you have to go
back and do a lot of manual auditing the

123
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:26,920
data some additional lookups so when she
figured out what I P spaces based on the

124
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,860
regional internet registries it's good
to review other sources to find possible

125
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:38,950
IP space rapid seven projects sonar
there are DNS lookups are excellent and

126
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:41,139
I'll show you an example of the
organization I worked

127
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:48,929
for how many are DNS records they had
laid little bit later on in multi go

128
00:11:48,929 --> 00:11:55,160
another couple resources who is basic
simple who is curious on the

129
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:01,669
organization since I O was something
that was brought up during our Charlotte

130
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:05,009
hackers meeting so it's another
excellent tool that can be used for for

131
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:11,299
doing this for some additional
considerations when doing your

132
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:15,999
reconnaissance work now we're talking
about a single organization that's fine

133
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:21,410
you have a lot of granularity where you
can go and actually investigate and

134
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:26,389
looked down into that organization but
what happens when that IP space becomes

135
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:30,869
inherited doin mergers and acquisitions
but now you gonna have to research and

136
00:12:30,869 --> 00:12:38,100
figure out what IP space was obtained
which was moved off which was sold and a

137
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,179
couple of the resources I found
LexisNexis has a mergers and

138
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:49,139
acquisitions database unfortunately
LexisNexis is a very costly subscription

139
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:54,049
base but if you have a legal
organization in our legal group in your

140
00:12:54,049 --> 00:12:58,999
organization as a good possibility that
there are already using LexisNexis some

141
00:12:58,999 --> 00:13:03,779
extent and you can use their web
services kid to search their their API

142
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:08,749
kinda looking for mergers and
acquisitions and going through this talk

143
00:13:08,749 --> 00:13:13,549
it's not just a single from my
perspective I'm a red teamer but it's

144
00:13:13,549 --> 00:13:16,199
not from that just perspective if you
are concerned

145
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:20,559
pen tester and you going to clients when
I'm looking to do is come up with a way

146
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:24,759
of doing all these things very quickly
because you usually given a two-week

147
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:27,239
assessment so you need to do these
things quickly to be able to identify

148
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:32,389
this space and find a target as possible
so I just if I had mentioned that before

149
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:36,910
it really wanna you know that it's
important not only for red blue team

150
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:45,118
members are also for penetration testers
Wikipedia actually has a pretty good API

151
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:49,199
there but obviously it's Wikipedia so
accuracy tends to

152
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:54,670
have problems there as well so a lot of
times I've gone through hyde actually

153
00:13:54,670 --> 00:14:01,719
had to manually verify acquisitions and
mergers and sales have been completely

154
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:07,460
accurate but some were missed even
mergers and acquisitions and I was doing

155
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:12,950
research were missed in LexisNexis that
actually Wikipedia had mention lotteries

156
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:17,210
repeat you have to do recon for all the
different affiliate companies all the

157
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:21,520
different things that you find so it is
a very tedious process if you have a

158
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,490
large organization or even a small
organization has changed names

159
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:33,990
throughout the years once we gather at
all this IP information and we verified

160
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:38,390
it we bought it for accuracy it's time
to move from the passive stage to stage

161
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:44,500
now oh this is very important only to
scan the IP space you have the

162
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:49,470
permission to do so why is that unless
you want to get a federal pound me in

163
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:54,700
the ass prison for a misunderstanding
yeah you probably should really make

164
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:59,840
sure that you're going after the IP
space that you have permission to do so

165
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:04,750
and I mention auditing again it's a pain
in the house I really do hate on any

166
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:09,380
things but you're not overlapping
bigotry you're you're not overlapping

167
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:13,800
and you're scanning for example and
instructor had an assessment where they

168
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,130
actually overlapped onto the sheriff's
joining the sheriff's network it was a

169
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:22,820
joining to the customer's network
because they hadn't properly done their

170
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:27,030
research to make sure that they had to
permission and I P series was correct

171
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,960
Sheriff's Office obviously doesn't
detect it is sheriff's offices don't

172
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:36,920
understand what security is so they
don't get in trouble for it but if you

173
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,329
doing so and you end up with the
government and military issues there

174
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:47,690
tools that can be used to release can
thrive in space I'm sure a lot of you

175
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:54,350
familiar with a large as I very large IP
space in a time frame that it takes to

176
00:15:54,350 --> 00:16:02,529
do a usual two-week assessment unicorns
EMAP I'm a scanner the three that I used

177
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:07,350
to research and find out what would be
the best I perform asking myself the

178
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:12,690
same taxes very similar to and can be
used to rapidly assess things in I can

179
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:17,990
throw it up on a VPS server like digital
ocean be able to scan it one gig speeds

180
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:23,680
and not really having slowdowns or
hiccups I would suggest not getting from

181
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,040
your home IP address unless you want the
internet provider do you disable your

182
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,860
account and tell you have power at
somebody else's streetcar don't take

183
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,690
credit for that but I don't wanna wake
up had that happen so LED digital ocean

184
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:39,830
could shut down

185
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:47,270
identifying target so we've now we've
scanned all the things we've identified

186
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:52,030
all the ports and services that are up
and running on all these different IP's

187
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:56,589
so there's a lot of cool things out
there you'll find Apache IIS tomcat

188
00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:01,940
server software that's just a handful
there's an entire list of vulnerable web

189
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:06,140
services out there just sitting there
listening that are part of the fall

190
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,390
configurations lamps taxes things like
that that end up not being configured

191
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:18,540
correctly so many home is a headless
browser and phantom JSK can leverage

192
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:25,329
JavaScript to do to perform queries
against website so this can assistance

193
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:30,340
screen shotting web services to help
identify interesting target the tool

194
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:35,560
that I i've been using his HTTP
screenshot I guess it's been over a year

195
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,940
now and shook on it was released its
very nice it does work well with

196
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:45,180
infantile Jas I'm so under 10 mention
peeping tom

197
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:50,500
unfortunately is no longer under
development by Jim tomes but he's moved

198
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,570
his foot is part of focusing on
eyewitness so I have to go back and

199
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:56,810
actually look through and see how
eyewitnesses doing things that evidently

200
00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:06,950
it does more things than just HTTP
screenshot so comes to talking about my

201
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:12,290
my tool by the one that I really want to
create one that I can never really get

202
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:16,800
working correctly the clergy thing that
that I'm trying to work on so here's the

203
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:22,960
idea that features try to take these
regional internet registry searches and

204
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,510
condense them down so that I can find
those relevant eyepiece basis so you're

205
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:30,510
not looking through your not having a
search through manually it's a real pain

206
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,790
in the ass especially if you only have a
very limited time for an engagement

207
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:40,129
using LexisNexis and Wikipedia probably
more towards wikipedia because of

208
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:45,790
LexisNexis costs but searching for
additional company on IP space inherited

209
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:50,889
by mergers and acquisitions exporting
documentation is very

210
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:56,850
important something to a CVS CSV file
rather chill out auditing you want to

211
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:00,770
make sure go back and double check and
make sure that you're not missing space

212
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:05,370
that should be in there or that you're
not getting spaces in your in your data

213
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:12,489
that you actually don't know when you
take that and put it into Maskin to

214
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:19,690
identify live target the way the
screenshot is work so you have to

215
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:26,900
identify what service wit HTTP HTTPS
report it's running on eighty eighty

216
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:31,440
eight thousand whatever but you can only
import in Europe format at this time I

217
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,760
haven't not the best at five fun and
learning this is doing this project kind

218
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:41,460
of a learning experience for me as I go
so you have to input that into issue be

219
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:49,180
screenshot so getting a way to automate
into HEB screenshot in a more rapid way

220
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:56,810
to scan targets and then automating
information on additional service port

221
00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:04,889
so your SSN and SNMP your FTP servers
here all these different things that

222
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:08,620
will identify themselves out on the
internet what they are

223
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,820
get information about those additional
parts that aren't with some of the

224
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:18,189
things I'm having a problem with right
now this is where smaller organizations

225
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:21,870
come together and they really are
beneficial like our Charlotte synonymous

226
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:25,610
of great feedback so nobody gets
feedback from you guys I'm still

227
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:32,949
learning Python I really would like to
bring this project to light if I don't

228
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:36,720
know if it's not beneficial to anyone
else to help automate this process but

229
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,170
some of the guys to go out and actually
do consultation works it'll be amazing

230
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:45,010
to have something that caught me but
also this work as a lot of it doesn't

231
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:51,830
get done due to the time from their
tests API's I'm having a problem with

232
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:56,710
LexisNexis very complicated set of API's

233
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:01,890
Wikipedia difficult to introduce and
then are ours works great so if you're

234
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:05,860
only doing business with companies in
North America should probably check and

235
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,199
make sure that you're only doing
business with companies in North America

236
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,270
first of all make sure that the other
regional registries across the world

237
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:17,350
aren't broadcasting IP space in another
area of the world that's what we do

238
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:22,990
diligence goes in but the API for
errands drink but the other ones are

239
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:27,399
changing like I mentioned before you got
shifts in these regional internet

240
00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:29,520
registries around the world

241
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,520
either not working API sorry the
networking they're not there or they

242
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,639
redirect and they cause all kinds of
crazy problems when you try to do some

243
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:48,169
recon getting audit documentation to be
automated been a challenge getting all

244
00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:54,470
this data into readable format somewhere
with human readable like a spreadsheet

245
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:59,520
of some type or we're discussing putting
in a database being able to automate

246
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,350
that and put it in a single place to be
able to query the data has been a

247
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:09,779
challenge and then told I've been using
for information gathering another

248
00:22:09,779 --> 00:22:16,070
service ports becoming unreliable if
you're familiar with using Metasploit

249
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:23,408
service scripts and things like that
when are going out to do like S&P Walker

250
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:26,799
he know some of those things can break
pretty easily

251
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:33,580
beautiful as it is kind of a turn
sometimes and I'm thinking about taking

252
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:37,980
this this entire idea and moving it to
something like every week on into

253
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:43,140
modules add that to a recurring dreams
great tool why do I need to go and do

254
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:47,590
something on my own and I really should
be putting it in a community supported

255
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:51,350
to all those other considerations I'm
kind of going through there

256
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:01,389
so like I mentioned before I'm not
wanting to share IP space for so rather

257
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:05,980
I don't show an example of some of the
data that I was able to pull based on

258
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:20,590
based on my research ok this is the IP
space of the parent company before any

259
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:26,949
mergers and acquisitions see quite a big
space a lot of these these appear I left

260
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:33,120
the / 16 so these are also / 16 address
spaces that are owned company you got

261
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,570
some here that I've marked as required
because I didn't want to leave the name

262
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:43,389
it was acquired on there so these are
acquisitions other other networks own

263
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:49,430
now you get down here and Aaron your
first seeing some things that are

264
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:54,940
reassigned and I started looking at
doing a $12 for scanning for some of the

265
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,150
stuff on our perimeter while doing
additional research and I couldn't find

266
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:03,450
out anywhere else is fine and that AT&T
space and we have leased lines with them

267
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:09,220
that they win an errand and said where
to reassign and say that this company

268
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:14,440
owns that 1884 got to go back and Aaron
and fix the record for now we we have

269
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,790
eyepiece racism on we're not sure if we
still least that line or if it's

270
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:26,180
actually been reallocated to another
customer so well their visions lead to

271
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:34,090
other IP spaces I came up with seven
other companies that actually the parent

272
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:38,669
company wasn't aware that we face out
there and I found web servers out there

273
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:44,370
from 93 is running in a closet somewhere
Windows 2000 it wasn't realized that's

274
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,659
out there either

275
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:53,070
though someone under someone they've got
a copy holder that they don't realize is

276
00:24:53,070 --> 00:25:04,149
actually a web server so I used the
little stuff with Excel hope to move

277
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:09,970
this into a data format database format
but this is kind of looking at Mass can

278
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:15,230
some of the things that set that I would
look at you start scanning on and

279
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:22,100
actually important these things into
mask in having data and then this is the

280
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:34,620
list that would be created that would be
fed into HTTP screenshot and i think is

281
