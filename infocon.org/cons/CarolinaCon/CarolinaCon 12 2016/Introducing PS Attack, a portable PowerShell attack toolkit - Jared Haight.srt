1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,870
thanks shown up

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:17,160
overs as everybody feeling these men are
so let's start this thing that I made my

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:26,210
name is Jared hey I'm a Manchester with
got the digital copy and sends a

4
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:30,349
previous life as a sysadmin it's really
want to introduce me to use scripting

5
00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:37,780
and moving in Syria and I want to see
that there is a lot of really

6
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:43,870
interesting stuff going on in the
section related to PowerShell I have

7
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:49,390
always shied away from defining myself
as a developer but I keep developing

8
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,390
things then releasing them which i think
is by definition what makes a developer

9
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:59,190
so own up to that label now and along
with my wife I'm the co-owner of a

10
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,420
broken bunny is famous freezer and he
got sick while ago and I was headed

11
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:10,240
stuck tilted so he looks really really
cute and very very curious at all times

12
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:22,049
so I noticed Carolina connie is
definitely a a gray beard con definitely

13
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:27,049
some older folk air some Linux gray hats
so as you start out with a new church

14
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:32,330
and see what the hell's PowerShell
PowerShell scripting language that

15
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:37,390
Microsoft came up with a while ago was
built into Windows seven when it came

16
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:42,720
out and it's this really powerful
language that's built into dieting that

17
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,179
so what makes it cool is outside of the
built-in tools that you get with

18
00:01:48,179 --> 00:01:52,899
PowerShell you also get full access to
everything that's in dotnet and you get

19
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:57,799
a lot of great methods to interact with
calm and WMI and all these made of ways

20
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:06,690
to manage Windows it's a object oriented
language so that makes it really easy to

21
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:12,380
work around the system a great example
of that is they rewritten paying so that

22
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,570
when you do something that actually
returns an object in a little bit like

23
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:21,260
the response time ttyl all sorts of
stuff that actually makes paying more

24
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:30,260
powerful the command structure in
PowerShell has a verb now sort of ocular

25
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:38,620
it makes language really propose but it
also makes it into it for example if you

26
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,720
have get content which is going to read
a free content from the file contents

27
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,269
are you write content to about so it's
going to be easy day into it you know

28
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:52,680
how to use power show the other cool
thing is the health system is actually

29
00:02:52,680 --> 00:03:00,630
usable it's a lot like man pages from
you know the dude that created our show

30
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:06,670
actually came from a Linux background so
you'll see a lot of knowledge to letting

31
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:12,319
scripting to the point that there are
built-in aliases for LLS W get girls

32
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,280
right in our show which is pretty cool
she also has really great to have

33
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,280
completion its type of lesion for

34
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:29,399
as great a completion for it commands as
well as the parameters for those

35
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,330
commands Wildcats are pretty much
anything in PowerShell you can talk

36
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:39,500
completed so really great easy language
to use its been used these days mainly

37
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:46,440
for administration networks Microsoft is
moving all of their management basically

38
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,270
overshoot PowerShell

39
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:52,940
manifesting itself in things like the
new versions of Exchange console new

40
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,680
versions of the Active Directory
administrative center these are all just

41
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,930
kind of GUI frontend for PowerShell
commands to the point that you can

42
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,600
enable a window that will show you of
the parachute pants are running in the

43
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,640
background

44
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,768
microsoft also is using it for
automation so if you're familiar with

45
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:11,250
Shaffer pop it

46
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,510
microsoft has something called desired
state config which is kind of their take

47
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:21,620
on you know popular and people accept a
lot more complicated I tried to use it

48
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:27,970
as a sysadmin and gave up and just use
it instead cuz actually puppet on

49
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:33,770
Windows was a lot easier to use than
desired state config any effort sec

50
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:38,060
community people are just grabbing onto
our show there is really a lot of great

51
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:44,729
stuff going on in the data forensics or
instant response side of the house lot

52
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:51,659
of work being done on lay real low level
risk analysis doing since PowerShell is

53
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,300
modern language is very networker we're
so it's really easy to do you like

54
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:01,650
queries for elective and blogs or W my
across the entire network of his makes

55
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:05,419
it super-easy to you you know do instant
response to you

56
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:10,870
investigation cross your whole network
for you no malicious the bands are you

57
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,210
know what have you

58
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:15,210
there's also a lot of worry I'm not
going to be talking a lot about the blue

59
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,030
team or instant response side of things
but if you are interested in that check

60
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:19,380
out

61
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:25,110
invoked ash I R dot com there is a guy
that runs that geriatrics and does

62
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:31,740
amazing work with our show last time I
checked your blog entry on the front of

63
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,380
his page where is like low-level disc
and analytics for his leg looking at

64
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,960
blocks on a disk using powershell which
is not something you would expect from

65
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:47,799
justice scripting language but we're
ratings so we're we want to break stuff

66
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:55,010
so I can go ahead and what can we do
with our shells you break stuff all the

67
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:59,130
great thing about it is our shelves with
the admins are using to manage their

68
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:04,260
networks so that means if we get on and
admins box we can manage their network

69
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:13,400
for them it's also really really hard to
lock down because PowerShell uses this

70
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:19,070
scary console that you type in windows
admins aren't really aware of it so in a

71
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:24,310
lot of cases they don't like it down
there not there's just zero wariness of

72
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:27,080
it what actually led to me

73
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,609
creating pas attack is at a friend that
was on an engagement and he landed on

74
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:37,050
this terminal server and it was really
well lockdown you couldn't open Explorer

75
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:43,220
II can open command prompt you could
open power show so we're going back over

76
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,140
Lake text messages back and forth you
know ok try this try to see you know

77
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:55,219
that means just weren't aware so it's a
great tool to use on the once you start

78
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,700
getting into the tools said some of the
work that's been done by the offensive

79
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:03,900
community there is a lot of really cool
advanced level stuff going on

80
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:09,380
you'll see a lot of stuff like DLL
injection or WMI abuse which is

81
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,230
something that

82
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:16,040
manifestation on twitter has been doing
some work on and what's great about this

83
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:21,490
is the community is really led by these
guys that they've been doing this for a

84
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:28,450
long time so they bring with them a very
mature methodology to power show and it

85
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:33,760
kind of comes from angles so from the
10th I strangle you see a lot of focus

86
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:39,110
on not leaving a trace or reusing tools
that are already on the box

87
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:43,490
a lot of in-memory its hacks you know
stuff like that and then on the flip

88
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:48,470
side more from the development and they
are very big on following the

89
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:53,710
conventions that PowerShell is kind of
built up within itself so supporting

90
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:58,159
that health system every man's going to
have like you know it get help he can

91
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,340
get a man page out of it every commands
going to use similar switches that you

92
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:07,719
see in other you know it's so the
offensive community does a good job of

93
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:14,510
jurors making in their tools work like
you'd expect a powerful tool to work so

94
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:21,550
I'll this is awesome but you know I've
noticed that as great as PowerShell is

95
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:25,960
there is this kind of barrier to entry
that you know people are kind of aware

96
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:30,849
that there's some cool stuff going on in
PowerShell if you put your standard

97
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,349
penthouse or in front of a PowerShell
console they wouldn't know what to do

98
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:41,530
with it and I think a lot of that is you
know Windows isn't that cool things like

99
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:45,150
focus on a really pay attention to all
your cool worried coz and stuff done in

100
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,199
like Python on Linux and stuff like that

101
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,880
developments out of windows just isn't
as interesting or glamour it's

102
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:56,820
as you know what you would see on the
Linux side and the other side is you

103
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,800
know it's can be intimidating

104
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,130
you know there's a lot of stories that
have a hard enough time doing something

105
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:07,500
productive with Python you know they
never tell me learn this language that

106
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:12,330
you know is this Windows niche you know
it's not it's not on their list of

107
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:18,750
priorities and then you know I mentioned
that the general populace is kind of

108
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,530
aware of that there is some cool stuff
going on in PowerShell but they don't

109
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:26,579
know the specifics and that's good
there's kind of this like our show click

110
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,060
on Twitter where yeah I mean there's a
lot of course you're going on but unless

111
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,410
you're following that circle you're
probably not aware it like that certain

112
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:39,829
stuff doesn't kind of surface out of
that you know little tiny click so

113
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:47,200
that's kind of what led me to build pas
attack so yes attack is a custom

114
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:53,380
PowerShell console designed for
offensive use it includes a lot of the

115
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:57,370
best offensive utilities that are
available in the PowerShot community to

116
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:02,840
rate their embedded into it it also
tries to emulate PowerShell console

117
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:08,370
experience so that includes using really
powerful tab completion of the man's

118
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:13,300
you're running in PowerShell commands in
PAS attack so if you are familiar with

119
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,630
our show as it is right now then you can
just can't jump into POS tagging it

120
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,230
going

121
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,750
if you're not familiar with our show you
can come learn get your chops and then

122
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,490
apply those two other instances you know
when you kind of start getting involved

123
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:29,780
with empire or land out of her shell
prompt that isn't BS attack you'll know

124
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,610
what to do

125
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:35,990
the other thing that you want to make
the barrier to entry as low as possible

126
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:41,530
so it is a single executable there is no
set up there is no install you download

127
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:49,689
this executable and run it on and get
hacking so with India stack there are

128
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:54,610
over a hundred and ten commands that
cover the entire range of a pen testing

129
00:10:54,610 --> 00:11:00,680
gauge meant so recon privilege
escalation back doors lot of great work

130
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,459
on recon

131
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:05,429
on that later it includes a lot of
demands from frameworks that you might

132
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:10,679
be familiar with power tools power
supply teaching is a really big projects

133
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:16,860
are just these giant Lee monolithic
collections of offensive towards their

134
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:23,740
awesome also under surface some of the
lesser-known tools NPS attack so it

135
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:28,600
includes invade which if you're familiar
with responder it's basically responder

136
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:35,499
but in our show so it can do a zombie
relay can do basically capturing

137
00:11:35,499 --> 00:11:40,600
credentials and stuff by speaking like
the W pad proxy address a lot of really

138
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,589
great work being done there

139
00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:47,059
the other thing includes is Powercat
which is a cat but in PowerShell as

140
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:53,230
evidenced by its name what's cool about
our cat I found out so like Nick at how

141
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:58,360
you can do dashiki you know XQ bash and
throw that at a reverse IP and get your

142
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:05,480
shell will do the same thing except
throws back to our show what's cool

143
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,110
about running power cap with NPS attack
though is the PowerShell session it

144
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:15,759
sends out has all the tools in PAS
attack RA and so it's like this fully

145
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:21,759
weaponized shoulder sending back to you
right here it's pretty cool so with a

146
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:26,350
hundred and ten commands that still
overwhelmingly acres in this problem do

147
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:30,699
you still have no idea what to do so I
wrote a man called get attack and where

148
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:35,319
get attacked does is it access like a
search engine for attacked or you know

149
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:39,439
it's a commands so that's the limits on
the screen but basically you can give it

150
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:44,269
any strain and it's going to search
through all the commands NPR's tack

151
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:48,360
every journalist of whatever it is that
matches your query so in this case we're

152
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,949
looking for passwords we could see that
we got mimic as forgot your password etc

153
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:59,740
countless get through with building pas
attack I wanted to make sure that it

154
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,879
wasn't just for the lab I want to build
something that would actually be used

155
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:07,220
for OnLive engagements so when the
things I'm doing is

156
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:13,220
is the payloads these routes are
offensive PowerShell scripts there

157
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:18,709
encrypted before they are compiled into
ups attack and then when you start vs

158
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:23,779
attack it takes is encrypted payloads
and decrypt straight into memory so the

159
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:28,480
decrypted playing sax payloads never
actually touched disc Davies gotten a

160
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,139
little bit better about detecting some
of the more common or more popular

161
00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:36,430
offensive PowerShell scripts like
democrats so this kind of voice that

162
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:43,040
because there is nothing for a beat the
tax also sends it's it's a custom

163
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,620
console it doesn't actually touch
Powershot exe it's called through dot

164
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:52,220
net income supports that so in the event
you land on a box where PowerShell died

165
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:57,629
txt is blocks they can't really block
the dotnet d lolz so this should still

166
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:03,009
work on her pretty much any circumstance
will be able to execute our show the

167
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:07,329
other thing is I want to focus on making
sure that this worked everywhere so

168
00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:12,388
pissed at targets done at three top-five
which means that it works on anything

169
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:16,600
from a clean install of Windows seven
other way up through a fully patched

170
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,199
version of Windows 10 that one
executable run across everything

171
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:33,279
that's a great question as that when I'm
asking questions short answer and so the

172
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,269
other cool thing is it is just a
PowerShell console so you do have access

173
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:43,130
to get help which like I said his parish
else kind of me and Paige equivalent any

174
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:47,430
command in PAS attack a native
PowerShell command or something that was

175
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:52,250
included by the offensive community will
support get a shop and kinda give you an

176
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,839
example of how to use it if you add the
parameters that except stuff like that

177
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:02,170
so it's kind of a democrat here and
hopefully it doesn't go well

178
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:20,380
so in this case we are on a high note we
found it does stop it was unmarked we

179
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:29,600
had fierce attack on a USB key we're
gonna go ahead and run it good for

180
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,540
everybody waitin back see what's going
on

181
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:39,689
ok so the first thing to do is see if I
can find some passwords on the network

182
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:46,000
so I can do here is just throwing get
attack passwords and its gonna return a

183
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,450
list like I said everything that has
passwords are involved passwords lot of

184
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,930
that is he invades stuff which is going
to be able to use of hashes and stuff

185
00:15:54,930 --> 00:16:06,390
like that where we're interested in
though is get upp password password if

186
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:12,370
you're not familiar so admins in a
Windows domain have the ability to set

187
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:17,750
passwords through Group Policy they
would do this to set leg local admin

188
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,900
account so you can save passwords
through that or if you have a scheduled

189
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:25,459
task they want to run under specific
credentials you can use Group Policy to

190
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:31,220
define all of that Microsoft was for
thinking they were encrypted passwords

191
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:35,770
strain that get sent out to all the
computers they were then super helpful

192
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:42,150
and published the encryption strength to
Amnesty yet so

193
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:47,420
now when you try to do this in a modern
Windows Devaney usually get a prompt

194
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:53,490
that says hey this is a really bad idea
you shouldn't do this by legacy you when

195
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:57,050
its demands have a ton of this stuff so
it's it's a great little like kidney

196
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:06,418
punch to you know get a free password so
it's going to get GBP password so hit

197
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:11,630
the account name is robot have its
password and looks like this was set for

198
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:17,039
a scheduled task or something like that
in the network so the next thing I do is

199
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,829
get a little bit more information about
this robot account so I'm gonna do you

200
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:30,658
search for Active Directory stuff I
agree Active Directory so there is a lot

201
00:17:30,659 --> 00:17:36,640
of recon stuff NPS attack and all that
is really provided by the power of you

202
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:45,169
module which was written by harm joy I
believe a lot of really grade just ways

203
00:17:45,169 --> 00:17:48,630
to get a fake get figure out what's
going on in the environment are great

204
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:54,230
tools we're looking specifically for use
a related stuff so we have get a user

205
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:59,929
information for a given user in a demain
sounds like exactly what we're looking

206
00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:08,950
for is going just you get help she has
ever known get new user before actually

207
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:13,090
haven't done this demo billion times so
get help

208
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:20,770
looks like exactly what we're expecting
every user name specified domain so

209
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:27,850
let's just go ahead and you get a user
per user name

210
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,320
so we get all the information from Ed

211
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:39,020
login account last time they had about
house where it looks like this is a

212
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:45,800
service account for stuff what's
interesting to us though is he's a

213
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:52,040
member of a group called local admin
which sounds really promising so what I

214
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:58,450
want to do is to find out more about
that group so let's do another search Q

215
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:01,450
see what we have as far as groups are
concerned

216
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:12,090
alright so we want to see it says local
admin let's look at local groups on the

217
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:16,908
computer see if that actually matches
the way we'd like it to get local group

218
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:26,279
looks good will do it helped so we
specify computer name is one to run

219
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:31,120
against a computer at school but looks
like we just have to specify like group

220
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,039
name and it should work out just fine so
local group

221
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,380
alright so this is everybody that's in
the local Administrators group on this

222
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:55,800
computer you have an administrator
account an admin account domain admins

223
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:00,550
and our local admin group so that robot
account should have local admin on this

224
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:06,050
box so let's go ahead and restart
pierced acronym run it as local admin

225
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:09,050
account though

226
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:35,109
local admin account looking at how it
was you know how that group is set up

227
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:39,989
I'm kinda suspecting that robot is gonna
have admin access to other boxes in the

228
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:45,210
network so let's do a search through get
attacked for local admin and see if we

229
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:53,539
have any sort of Rehan stuff that we can
do here have you mean like called find

230
00:20:53,539 --> 00:20:57,389
local admin access this is going to see
if I machines on local demand that our

231
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:00,389
current box as local admin on

232
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:13,950
so it is running back with 16 gigs
around it's not gonna run more than two

233
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:20,309
boxes lab seven years to you and lets 71
where line 701 so it seemed as she was

234
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:23,509
in other parts of the network

235
00:21:23,509 --> 00:21:29,299
the other thing I want to do is so we
know that we have admin access

236
00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:34,979
throughout the network computer network
we want to find some domain admins those

237
00:21:34,979 --> 00:21:41,299
who try to ask later privileges so we
can do I know that we have something for

238
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:47,549
finding admins and here so I can just do
a search for find and return everything

239
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:58,629
back this is my favorite command average
it's genius invoke user under way

240
00:21:58,629 --> 00:22:03,718
invoke user hundred days is scans
through the network and finds any

241
00:22:03,719 --> 00:22:10,639
computers that users in a specified
group are logged into so let's go ahead

242
00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:13,639
and look at the help for this

243
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:24,630
this is a mess I don't want to go at
thats like thirty seven parameters so

244
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,970
when the great things about get help

245
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:36,420
is you have the examples so the examples
is like your TLDR of a man page so here

246
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:41,760
we have eight examples of how to use
this command the first one is exactly

247
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,820
what we're looking for if I machines on
global demand or domain admins are

248
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:50,030
logged into you and we can check if we
have local admin rights to it so it's

249
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:53,030
just go ahead and run that

250
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:05,530
so we have a domain admin as username is
admin 1 I'm not original and it looks

251
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:11,920
like we do have local admin rights on it
through this field right here so we're

252
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:17,040
gonna run democrats democrats is great
if you're not familiar with democrats so

253
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:24,010
many cats is like this with Army Knife
credentials and tokens in a Windows

254
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:29,290
environment you can do all sorts of
really interesting stuff like creating

255
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:36,139
your own tokens of being taken stuff
like that way most people use it for is

256
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:42,240
dumped in credentials Democrats will run
against a computer and dump the

257
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,490
credentials that be else as process has
in memory

258
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:55,010
windows after I think windows 8 don't
want it did change things so that only

259
00:23:55,010 --> 00:24:00,810
hashes are stored in memory Microsoft
really helpfully provided a rich kid you

260
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:04,750
can rebirth that behavior said you have
a local admin rights on the box you can

261
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,350
join us

262
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:10,790
remarried a way for somebody to log back
in and get their point X crowds sense we

263
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:14,300
are mimicking a pretty standard
corporate environment here on Windows 7

264
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:21,570
is why upgrade and what's great about
Windows 7 is many cats works beautifully

265
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:27,439
on Windows seven other cool thing about
democrats is mentioned reflect a DLL

266
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,750
injection before so that comes into play
with democrats here

267
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:37,320
way in both democrats does he run it
against a remote computer and it injects

268
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,520
the democrats DOL straight into memory
on that remote computer so it never

269
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,150
touches debts like I mentioned AV is
really good about detecting democrats

270
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:51,040
this is a way that we can get around
that usage is pretty straightforward we

271
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,930
just need space back computer name and

272
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:57,750
don't crowds so let's go ahead and do
that

273
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:22,509
ok so we gotta get back and you can see
we ever have the actual like computer

274
00:25:22,509 --> 00:25:37,789
account which is great we also have the
admin password think that's the first

275
00:25:37,789 --> 00:25:46,490
time anybody's clapped for one of my
demos that's pretty cool right so we

276
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:54,269
remain friends I want to you know get
outta here so I like here here here here

277
00:25:54,269 --> 00:26:03,389
so what I'm gonna do is dump the Active
Directory database so anti vs.net that

278
00:26:03,389 --> 00:26:07,719
way I can copy it to a USB key you know
the developer may be coming back from

279
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,909
lunch or whatever soon here so it's good
and start up his attack and this time as

280
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:14,909
the domain admin that we just got credit
for

281
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:31,600
so here all right so we need to do is
find out what our controllers that's

282
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:40,459
where anti-assad its gonna get attacked
me and controllers and we have it for

283
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:44,299
again at the main controller I was just
in return to list the domain controllers

284
00:26:44,299 --> 00:26:57,970
in the network sites we have won again
16 Big Mac and we get hits were all

285
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:02,110
sorts of information about EDC what is
no rules it has its IP address websites

286
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:08,129
and and its hostname mixing why do is
figure out what we're gonna do to copy

287
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:14,200
and TDS I did after this domain
controller so again and get attack and

288
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:20,669
copy there is a lot of tools for working
with volume shadow copies in the US

289
00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:21,610
attack

290
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:26,219
shadow copies are really cool there a
great way to get around by logs or

291
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:30,549
access permissions stuff like that but
we actually with all this going to

292
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:39,960
handle all this for us to copy what he
does is really really awesome it

293
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:46,429
actually analyzes the hard drive volume
and then takes that and purses it back

294
00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:52,100
into NTFS and re-creates the files that
way so does like this real real low

295
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:58,240
level copy desk and watched it back from
there again like not what you'd expect

296
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:04,059
from justice scripting language really
cool stuff so let's look at what the

297
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:07,340
plans are for a copy

298
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:17,870
and I'm lazy senators gonna skip
straight to the examples right so read

299
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:23,209
NCS from remote server invited to a
house on the local server so we need a

300
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:25,090
pass to what followed were looking for

301
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:28,709
Peter name or copying it from and our
local destination

302
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:54,210
2012 pretty scene we're just gonna go
into the folder that working out of here

303
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:19,090
this does take awhile because it is
doing such a low level access so it's

304
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:24,869
expected so we're gonna run well as
because I like that and we got our NCDs

305
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:27,869
study it

306
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:49,600
so i think is pretty awesome I think
it's super helpful tool I think you know

307
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,840
it is both useful for people new to
PowerShell people who already have

308
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:59,709
experience with it but it does have some
short so I think interest in evading an

309
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:06,360
antivirus just because it's it's an
interesting challenge and so while the

310
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:11,280
strings are encrypted in PAS attack it's
all the same strengths you know so

311
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:16,120
whoever downloads from the release page
stacked IKEA see you know you're going

312
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,129
to have the same strength as everybody
else

313
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:25,120
the other thing is the community is
super super active cities tools are

314
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:30,250
being improved all the time and he is
Jack naturally because it's a binary is

315
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:36,110
gonna have you know older tools then
what's currently available so created a

316
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:45,570
build tool for PSE TAC be built tool
makes it easy to build psh ACK which is

317
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:51,178
kind of funny because I'm gonna make you
compile stuff on Windows what it does is

318
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:56,409
it downloads the latest version of psh
ACK downloads the latest rules that it

319
00:30:56,409 --> 00:31:02,240
depends on the crips them with the key
and encompasses everything together so

320
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:08,559
at the end of this you get a custom-made
console that is uniquely you told the

321
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:09,260
other day

322
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:12,809
unique signatures and it's super easy to
use

323
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:21,158
so this is an example running so we
started it downloads be as tagged

324
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:26,990
downloads all the tools you can pause it
and kicked out a custom copy of your

325
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:29,990
stack

326
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:45,110
things about the bill tool is the
dependencies are actually super regional

327
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:53,510
you need done at 325 to build psh ACK
and then you need it by hand up maybe

328
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:59,520
you actually run the build tool reason
you need a three-day visit goes

329
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:05,590
backwards compatibility and is atrocious
and so I just standardized on that it

330
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,600
makes things easier

331
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:14,860
you also need a JSON bow card modules
dodges and it's included with the zip

332
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:20,229
file to download from get her modules
judge a sign it is really just a list of

333
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:24,730
URLs for the doors they're gonna be
downloading and the cool thing about

334
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:28,890
doing it with the JSON is if you find
something that you think to see

335
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:33,630
recording you want in your copy of your
stack it is really really easy to add it

336
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:42,110
the other thing is you know it helps if
there is a bug introduced in house files

337
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:45,860
you can easily roll back so it makes it
really easy to make this your own

338
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,860
version of PSE TAC

339
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:57,679
stacks up on again so that's get out dot
com slash shirt heat or you can get it

340
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:04,340
from wwe.com along with whatever random
shit I have up on there for the

341
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:11,629
precompiled versions are available on
the releases tab for both schools and so

342
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:14,820
that means basically all you have to do
to run these tools is downloaded zip

343
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:19,090
unzip it and run them neither have a
setup process or anything like that it's

344
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:27,919
super easy to get involved or get
started so with Carolina commonly seen

345
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:32,490
version one-dot oh I've had some beta
since release candidates kindly do not

346
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:36,160
do this but this is the official a hey
it's not a burning pile of garbage

347
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,340
release

348
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:44,470
but in the future besides the obvious
like a bug fixes and you know can stand

349
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:48,160
up to date on modules there is there's a
couple things I am interested in

350
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:55,570
involving with his tax that's better AV
evasion there's console emulation stuff

351
00:33:55,570 --> 00:34:01,270
that isn't quite spot on making it work
on but I'm really curious to see what be

352
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:06,310
community meets from this to like what
would make things easier for you guys

353
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:11,130
one of the things they don't want to
work on it is it is an interactive tool

354
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:16,800
so it doesn't play well with shells and
that's going to be a kind of focus you

355
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,940
know for development for you know the
foreseeable future until I can learn

356
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:27,400
that out but really comes down to you
you know what do you guys why you can

357
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:32,570
let me know please download this play
with it and some issues if something is

358
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:37,010
broken if something doesn't work quite
the way you think it should or if there

359
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:42,580
is a feature miss seen you know just let
me know I don't don't be afraid to

360
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:46,400
submit an issue you know and I can
expect you to Lake have a fix for it you

361
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:50,950
know I just want to get some people if
you don't want you to get home just

362
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:57,049
reach out to me on Twitter or through my
email I would be at the end but yeah if

363
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:00,360
you're if you're feeling froggy and why
it's important quest that would

364
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:05,570
definitely be appreciated this is my
first like Big C sharp project so it's

365
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:11,960
probably just a mess and I would deeply
appreciate more mature eyes on it let me

366
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,960
know all the ways I screwed up please be
kind

367
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:25,190
I definitely want to mention his attack
by itself actually isn't that advanced

368
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:30,170
of it or it's pretty straightforward
what makes it awesome is the PowerShot

369
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:37,930
unity so I mentioned earlier this hour
show click that you know kind of is

370
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:42,770
where all this cool stuff is happening
this is kind of the entry to that click

371
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:47,520
for you if you are slightly interested
in PowerShell an offensive PowerShell

372
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:53,680
these guys are doing all of the most
amazing work out there you know we've

373
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:59,759
got people from empire on their
manifestation runs Powershot mafia along

374
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,819
with a couple other guys which came his
way

375
00:36:01,819 --> 00:36:04,819
Paris boy para trolls and emerged into
you

376
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:10,000
Kevin Robertson did in May and he's
doing a lot of really cool stuff he's

377
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,279
wise he's got an up-and-coming guy just
kind of like a period with a check this

378
00:36:15,279 --> 00:36:21,359
out and is doing is really cool stuff
and an economy that you devious he if

379
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:26,500
you check out the shower shaving
framework which is why he's responsible

380
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:31,390
for is a lot of just really off the wall
Lake approaches to you back doors and

381
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:36,569
stuff like that so I just all really
cool people you follow me on Twitter I'm

382
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:43,609
incredibly grateful for their work so
there's my email address and my Twitter

383
00:36:43,609 --> 00:36:44,569
handle

384
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:49,940
if you're in the Charlotte area me and
some friends we meet up monthly for what

385
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:54,609
we call Charlotte hackers and I'm it's
basically it's where we just talked

386
00:36:54,609 --> 00:36:59,770
about you know read same stuff and then
drink beer and eat food afterwards so

387
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:04,390
it's called beta shot they made some
good friends were there aren't a lot of

388
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:12,578
stuff so happily take questions answered
with you as you would ask first question

389
00:37:12,579 --> 00:37:13,809
wise

390
00:37:13,809 --> 00:37:20,640
is it able to evade logging which was
introduced in our shop five so Microsoft

391
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:27,058
made a lot of changes with our show
version that are good for the end user

392
00:37:27,059 --> 00:37:32,380
and bad if you are trying to develop
evil PowerShell tools so some of things

393
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:39,189
it does is logging is a billion times
better in power show to the point of Lee

394
00:37:39,189 --> 00:37:45,868
there's too much logging now which is
probably a good thing the other thing it

395
00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:52,809
does is through Windows Defender winners
defender entered into a new module that

396
00:37:52,809 --> 00:37:58,829
sits in front of the Scripting Host
we're like all scripts are on the basic

397
00:37:58,829 --> 00:38:04,559
PowerShell whatever its model basically
looks its roots right before they run

398
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:10,829
and is herman's hey is this malicious or
not so it gets passed encoding you know

399
00:38:10,829 --> 00:38:15,579
you're past that stage the encryption
their peers attack does all that kind of

400
00:38:15,579 --> 00:38:21,900
mood cuz it's right before it gets
executed its I've already seen the

401
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:26,729
PowerShot community of it just for that
so what are the things you'll notice

402
00:38:26,729 --> 00:38:29,140
appear on the bill to as i mentioned lee

403
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,969
download some stuff and he might not
like it you know go and disable it

404
00:38:32,969 --> 00:38:39,380
Windows Defender will catch like three
of the scripts that he s attack use its

405
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:43,880
surprisingly enough democrats is no
longer one of this so they've obviously

406
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:48,239
made some changes recently that kind of
a pain that and I expect we'll see that

407
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:57,219
more as time goes on my take on it is
dads right now Windows Defender is the

408
00:38:57,219 --> 00:39:02,999
only anniversary I'm aware of that is
using that model it is open other AV's

409
00:39:02,999 --> 00:39:07,299
can use it but we are pleased to have a
little bit of a window here before AV

410
00:39:07,299 --> 00:39:11,689
started using it you know especially in
corporate enterprises running like a

411
00:39:11,689 --> 00:39:14,660
Symantec Enterprise 11 or something like
that

412
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:20,680
like you're probably still have a real
good range of success using psh ACK

413
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:25,279
and an actual environment and the same
goes back to that log in as well

414
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,589
Parish LA introducing a lot of cool
stuff but the windows admins are

415
00:39:29,589 --> 00:39:33,900
catching up you know they're they're as
unaware of PowerShell as like the

416
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:39,770
secretary is maybe more so honestly so
it still is it still right through the

417
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:43,569
harvest things are changing so any other
questions

418
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:01,979
yet they were there is a great idea and
if you would like to submit an issue

419
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:06,260
that I would really appreciate that
sorry the question why is there a way to

420
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:11,090
run vs attack without letting it touch
disc and right now just because nature

421
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:17,180
it is an interactive console it is kind
of how was built but that is kinda

422
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:20,940
focused you know going forward is how
can I make this work over River shells

423
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:26,619
how can I make this work without
touching desk so it's coming i hope i

424
00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:38,510
think im so forgot to mention that so
our show has an execution policy so when

425
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:42,770
you try to import a script that's from
the Internet by the father is going to

426
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:47,340
say hey this is from the internet it's
probably bad run it and I won't let you

427
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:56,070
run it so you can change that execution
policy but you were fired by the way

428
00:40:56,070 --> 00:41:00,040
most people change it you need to be an
admin on the box to update it when I

429
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:06,859
found out in developing vs attack is the
set execution policy command has options

430
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:12,560
those options are dash current user or a
used ESCO and then you can specify

431
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:17,970
current user which you don't need admin
rights for his attaches the HKC you reg

432
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:23,640
key or gosh process we're just for this
process it's going good disabled

433
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:28,020
execution policy MPs attack starts up
the very first thing it does is just

434
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:31,020
Sables execution policy for its process

435
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:49,869
that's very true so another way you can
get around the execution policy is just

436
00:41:49,869 --> 00:41:55,809
basically instead of calling me strip as
he filed you can either just copy and

437
00:41:55,809 --> 00:41:59,849
paste the contents of this crap street
into PowerShell or you can save it

438
00:41:59,849 --> 00:42:06,599
selected text file invoke that text
files so the jeffries over the guy that

439
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:09,819
creative PowerShell has gone on record
of saying like what this was never

440
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:14,589
designed to be a security policy but you
know they wouldn't let me name it lay a

441
00:42:14,589 --> 00:42:26,480
decision to fire him security policy so
we get what we get any other questions I

442
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:38,400
did write all this so it for five months
or so I mean there was a lot of work I

443
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:45,470
would say I probably put 80 to 100 hours
and it and that was coming out from not

444
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:52,919
really having any idea what do it seems
sure to this point I did PowerShell is

445
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:59,890
creating your own PowerShell console is
complicated and not well documented so I

446
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:03,269
ended up having seen a lot of other
projects to do that

447
00:43:03,269 --> 00:43:08,848
bench and it has the past their crime
work which he created for instant

448
00:43:08,849 --> 00:43:13,559
response teams and it's a custom
PowerShell console and so reference in

449
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:17,460
the previous talk how to copy and paste
code from Stack Overflow this was how to

450
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:23,569
copy and paste code from github so there
is i think i understand most of it does

451
00:43:23,569 --> 00:43:25,509
but there is probably a couple lines

452
00:43:25,509 --> 00:43:28,639
that it works

453
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,789
go any other questions

454
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:44,790
question is where was the hardest part
of writing us and we took the most time

455
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:54,480
versus time so the hardest part about
writing is actually be typing itself and

456
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,630
there may be an easier way to do this
but my original idea was to use

457
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:04,290
predefined so if you're not familiar
with scripting or in OC or whatever

458
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:09,870
reason I'm basically says like hey I'm
going to prompt the user for input and

459
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:12,000
they're gonna tape and once they hit
enter

460
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,140
I'm gonna take that and put it and use
it so this would be super easy because

461
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:20,859
you know kato get it dash attack you hit
enter i take that executed as Powershot

462
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:25,970
the problem was I couldn't figure out an
easy way to make that work with tap and

463
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:31,109
for me to completion was absolutely
essential for that's so what I ended up

464
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:36,140
doing is basically rewriting the entire
consult said that anytime you hit a key

465
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:42,150
I'm analyzing it and like making
decisions based off a bit so all of the

466
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:46,990
edge cases they're coming out of bed for
a while there are bills were like if you

467
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:51,029
hit left on the keyboard it just
depended in invisible left character to

468
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:57,960
be strange so I think I worked through
all that but yeah there is definitely

469
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:05,090
the hardest part of the easiest powered
was set on any of this was super easy

470
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:17,569
getting getting the color to blue I was
pretty easy any other questions

471
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:30,319
so I had to rate the auto-completion I
ended up writing the auto-completion

472
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:41,390
myself and so about after a node out of
completion is up there and also when the

473
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:48,069
hardest things about this after I put
like 15 20 hours in auto completion and

474
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:56,430
other custom Powershot project came out
so airs on ideas like great but it's all

475
00:45:56,430 --> 00:46:02,200
good we can learn from each other I I
got over that quickly in their release

476
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:05,609
they had mentioned like oh yeah we're
just going to use this chab expansion I

477
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:11,160
did you are incomplete so it turns out
parasol actually automatically 3.net

478
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:17,350
will let you use its own tab completion
I'm going to stand by my custom

479
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:22,680
implementation because between
PowerShell version 2 and version 3 they

480
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:27,160
changed how it's how completion worked
so if I wanted this to work across all

481
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:31,520
versions of PowerShell I have to lay
detect what version of Skype completion

482
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:38,660
it was probably be easier but insulate
the existing tab completion as like it's

483
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:45,250
gonna work against everything so we'll
just leave it as any other questions yet

484
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:59,828
I have not because I don't have a
license for global trade so if you'd

485
00:46:59,829 --> 00:47:03,430
like to donate that towards developing
that would be much grateful and I'll

486
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:16,848
tell me check that out any other
questions I was going to defend against

487
00:47:16,849 --> 00:47:24,089
fierce attack what would I do so there
are and I wish I knew them off the top

488
00:47:24,089 --> 00:47:30,369
man or have references for this if you
go through manifestations Twitter feed

489
00:47:30,369 --> 00:47:35,690
he does he's done a lot of light posts
on here a WMI queries that will catch

490
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:40,020
like weird movement throughout your
network so stuff like reflective

491
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:45,119
learning DL else or impersonating tokens
and stuff you wouldn't expect from a

492
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:52,200
computer you know within your place from
your end users and so that's really I

493
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:57,200
don't know that there is anything you
can do necessarily I don't know what you

494
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:02,129
do to protect Pessac from running but at
least detecting it there is a lot of WMI

495
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:05,770
queries that you could use to do better

496
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:17,270
you really can't that I'm aware of
because it's part of dotnet so our show

497
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:24,230
is in just her shutout exe it's actually
like dotnet assemblies so i shud i txt

498
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:30,240
is doing a lot of the same stuff I am
just better because they're highly paid

499
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:34,790
developers and I did this my free time
but it's essentially the same thing

500
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:38,140
they're creating a PowerShell console
that safety net in the background

501
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:44,930
execute Powershot so I'm not aware of a
way to actually disabled friend that

502
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:49,700
works at a bank in Charlotte that he
says they've done this and I might do to

503
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:53,250
get around here stack let me know what
happens and so far I haven't heard back

504
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:56,250
so we'll see

505
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:04,880
yeah we would truly be if you want me to
get this running Windows XP let me give

506
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:11,880
you my card so we can range from God ok
greens any other questions

507
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,370
yeah there was $106 they are awesome

508
00:49:44,869 --> 00:49:53,059
you're going to get go I guess well I
appreciate and
