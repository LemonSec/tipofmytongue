1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,960
I said thanks for coming out early
Sunday morning

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:16,920
give yourself a big hand for 90 days I
i've been here most of the weekend

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:23,289
there's a lot of sense those talks and
so I really spent most of my career on

4
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:27,930
the defensive side although if any
offensive people are hiring you know

5
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:33,149
when to come see me after this talk but
I spend most my time on the defensive

6
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:39,920
side and it's pretty boring side to be
on but it's also very hard so but then

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,520
this whole new you know threat Intel
field came out the past few years and it

8
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,879
is the least on the defenders side it
makes it at at least somewhat

9
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:58,559
interesting here's a disclaimer so I'm
representing myself here so you know

10
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,929
don't sue me but I have not twenty years
and nutrition security the past 16 have

11
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:11,320
been focused within influence in the
preview the previous four years was as

12
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:16,880
general I T stuff and I spent the past
five or six years working in socks so

13
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:23,970
doing a lot of you know just really fun
stuff either working in training or

14
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:29,630
trying to lead but as you can see the
pictures going around there I've done a

15
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:34,009
lot of things union and the top left I
started out there and web security stuff

16
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:38,540
so I spent testing and then I got into a
bunch of boring stuff like security

17
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:43,060
engineering and if you work for the
government got into doing business in

18
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,869
they found out I could write and said
hey will you help us like like lie in

19
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:53,100
our proposals in a makeup call you know
if you want to pay me sure but after a

20
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,210
few years I kinda got bored with that in
it wanted to get back to doing more

21
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:01,579
technical things so few years ago I was
like it's really hard to take a step

22
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,470
back

23
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:08,330
and make the same amount of money but
somehow I I continue to get lucky and

24
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:13,980
you know basically find some good
pitches to get into so I started doing

25
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:19,690
trade studies looking at things like
Lake sins and and guards and fun stuff

26
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:26,750
like that and it just doing in analysis
of all the gin in creating a simple

27
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,100
spreadsheet so that people could you
know wait what requirements are

28
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:36,150
important to them and then that would
help them pick the rate Lucian but then

29
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,240
like I said I've been working in talks
for the past few years just really fun a

30
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,530
lot of my work previously was more in
need

31
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,490
development and engineering side so
whenever I got to do in the cops type

32
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:55,370
work is just such a different world very
exciting and most recently I just

33
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,790
switched jobs and still am in a training
position now so so miss going around

34
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,400
doing some fun starts training people on
things that are not allowed to talk

35
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,030
about rights over the past nine years
now

36
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:13,269
around this a cloud know the infant
sacbee.com says just upload for that do

37
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:19,060
you know through that it might be some
say something to you so this one of like

38
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,870
that you know please check it out

39
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:28,440
can follow it on Twitter at its newly
intersect so it will sue to jump into

40
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,160
that stuff here just give you a little
bit of background so so like I said I I

41
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:40,510
was I was working against socks and you
know and and a few years ago threat in

42
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:45,890
Intel started being this big thing in
and I really want to take advantage and

43
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:50,548
because it was just so much more
exciting than just an alert pops do a

44
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:56,420
quick investigation in then they reimage
the parks and move on to this sort of

45
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,859
darkness

46
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:04,090
by so I wanted you know just add a
little bit more excitement to it except

47
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:08,960
the organization that I was working with
was no we don't do that they weren't

48
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:14,370
about to give me like my own box or
hardware to do things on so I was like

49
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,070
re well I'm gonna build my own and just
do it for these funds so you know I was

50
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:22,070
looking for something that are eight
something I mean I was gonna put like

51
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,500
sensitive stuff there but I wanted
something that I can be hosted

52
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:35,040
externally what else in then but I could
access it from anywhere so essentially I

53
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,850
was looking for you know this big bucket
of stuff that I could just don't then

54
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:45,690
was initially I was really into trying
to collect OS in stuff all the seeds and

55
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:49,690
stuff that are out there and just thrown
into big bucket and at least having this

56
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:54,610
this one source that I could go and just
search on it seems like it's an event

57
00:04:54,610 --> 00:05:00,030
pops then maybe I could you know search
my little store to see if I could could

58
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:05,440
gain any additional in say so I was
looking for this bucket that I could

59
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,310
just dump the stuff into you know and in
various things even put you know that

60
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:16,919
maybe they could be cheaper running blog
eight-day could be things like rss feeds

61
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:22,729
periodically there are a lot of black
lists and stuff that are pushed out to

62
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:26,960
being able to take those files Dean
texting when they change in and popping

63
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,789
them in into this big bucket or just
anything else you know the vendors come

64
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:38,710
out with a new eighteen Greenport trying
to describe that and dumping it in there

65
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:45,080
and being able to make it cert
searchable to sue the other requirements

66
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,200
those really looking for was that easily
find data so I wanted you know search

67
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:55,510
just don't mean simple search not being
able to go into search on and I don't

68
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,980
mean whatever

69
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:03,270
you know basically learn anything
anything interesting that can help me do

70
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,250
my job but just some other just general
I think

71
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:14,830
database type things properties you know
how they have a habit being you know you

72
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:19,159
can cast a shadow guys things in one of
the things that I really like and I

73
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,700
think it's a very powerful technique is
tagging so being able to just randomly

74
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:32,560
add interesting ways of classifying data
in then using those tags 222 slice and

75
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:41,630
dice the data that you do have been in
more interesting ways so I was really

76
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:51,490
into every at the time is really psyched
about it just to I really like because

77
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:55,140
it really met this requirement is being
this big bucket of things that I can

78
00:06:55,140 --> 00:07:00,219
just don't stuff into an inserted laid
later it had this really advanced

79
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:05,260
tagging feature so you could reasonably
tag stuff and in where I learned a lot

80
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,280
about that was this interesting getting
things done

81
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:14,560
method is everybody getting things done
that was sort of like the rage about 5

82
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,630
10 years ago so I'm I'm still there so
is everybody from the year 2000 with

83
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:25,650
getting things done right so it's
basically like a tu system but it's you

84
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:32,469
know idk extending go towards it and
it's fun to go to bed with class

85
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:39,280
classifying things so one of the things
like one of the things I really like

86
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,729
about it is it got me thinking about
every afternoon in a totally separate

87
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:48,360
way because it's you know every I guess
notebook you could think is almost being

88
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:58,030
a a table in a deed database in every
node is essentially one row and it had

89
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:02,190
all these features that I was looking
for I can't have you no tags in and I

90
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,150
had to put data in in there and it was
very surged searchable

91
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:14,620
so I really liked it so I basically
started adapting ever knew

92
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:19,970
into being well initially I just called
it this big data dump thing but then a

93
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:24,020
few years later I learned that there's a
cool term called threat intelligence

94
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:35,030
platform so so so now I see now I can
cut tip so it's still good and I learned

95
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:42,949
a lot of grief lessons there I I still
use it I think it's just just fine you

96
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:47,900
know I personally don't have anything
they then I'm trying to defend her say

97
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:55,620
besides like a website but I have some
odd that exceeds and stuff pushing into

98
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,970
it initially with the original goal of
of taking the OS in and just dumping it

99
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:08,130
dumping it in that that kind of seed of
how this whole thing started eventually

100
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:13,270
failed because ever need to start see
like after about 80,000 notes ever

101
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:19,670
newt's just district runs to a crowd so
I simply had like a lot of stairs to

102
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,719
leave a lot of stuff out of there

103
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,990
reinstall the whole thing and get it to
work so that I could use it for D-day

104
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:33,380
purposes but it was a fun experiment in
it it really got me thinking about you

105
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,130
know the whole threat intelligence
process in in how we could do something

106
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:42,850
on our own but in the long run you know
I don't think you know for anybody

107
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:47,280
looking to build a threat intelligence
platform on the TV and need yeah you

108
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,990
could use it ever know but your marriage
or management's

109
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:55,720
probably have a huge debt so looking at
you know like the next steps we're

110
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,180
looking at you know taking the lessons
learned that I had here and looking at

111
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,010
where we can go

112
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:11,040
so i think you know what I don't know I
don't like a war per se but in a battle

113
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,560
so really so what's a quote

114
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,900
what's a presentation about something
like this without a sense you quote so

115
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:25,750
in in this is the traditional lake Lake
if you know your enemy you're gonna win

116
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:32,470
the battle tape thing into in
essentially that is a big part of what

117
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:37,990
threat intelligence is being able to
know as much about your enemy as

118
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:45,230
possible now I searched around for a
good definition intelligence into this

119
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,800
is one that I found from Gardiner so
threat intelligence is evidence-based

120
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,359
knowledge including context mechanisms
indicators implication in actionable

121
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,020
advice about existing or emerging menace
or hazard to assets that can be used to

122
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:03,350
inform decisions regarding subjects
response to that menace or hazard

123
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:11,130
anybody understand that right so sorry
for $200 more you can get a four page

124
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:18,260
report that describes what that says so
basically you know this is my real world

125
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:22,069
definition here is it's actionable
information that you can use to de-

126
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:27,470
Tector stop the bad guys and it's a
information there because there's a big

127
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:31,690
there's a big difference between a day

128
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:37,480
data in the information that's coming
from that era so there's a lot of feeds

129
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:42,120
that you can buy now and I consider that
you know really threat data not threat

130
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,120
intelligence

131
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:51,020
get water water water later so is it is
everybody familiar with this model here

132
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:54,020
this pyramid of pain by David Bianco

133
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,860
this is the quintessential and I think
you put this out in 2013 or 2014 but it

134
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,510
really you know for a typical guy like
myself this really made

135
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,340
this defied what threat intelligence was
until you know in in the way he

136
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:14,790
organized this was that stuff that's
easy to get all the way up to really

137
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:19,219
hard stuff and so you start out with
trivial stuff just you know has values

138
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:26,740
IP addresses we're pretty familiar with
that domain names she your network so I

139
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:32,130
should host artifacts and even tools
like anyone in this room can probably

140
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:36,320
figure out what I'm talking about their
but whenever you get to teach me teach

141
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:42,470
TDP that's where I think we're the
threat intelligence comes in so like I

142
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:46,580
said I class I classify this as you know
the bottom portion of discrete is more

143
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:52,740
you know threat data in the top part is
more threat in tow in you know a lot of

144
00:12:52,740 --> 00:13:00,980
what you're buying today really is in
their interests more threat data so I I

145
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,770
was the vendors would start using the
right language but then that doesn't so

146
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:10,380
so really there there's a whole process
that you have to go through in this is

147
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:17,400
kind of our overview diagram on the
right there of the process for doing

148
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:25,060
traditional intelligence now assistant
so you really take all the information

149
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:30,219
that you have and you do this whole
process to it in and out of that you get

150
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:35,990
this trickles of intelligence which are
really maybe you know your TTP easier

151
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:41,450
your how your enemy does things you
really understanding what they do

152
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:51,230
now a lot of what you buy out there like
I said its threat data there's some

153
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:57,410
there's some good it's definitely good
for late like I see it is very useful in

154
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:05,600
if you're just using it for broad-based
tax for example if there is you know you

155
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:12,320
know you see two or you know crypto
actor like a website that that's pushing

156
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,160
that I mean in those cases you know just
just for this broad-based attacks that

157
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,850
sort of data works well but the problem
is is that a lot of these feeds they're

158
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:28,260
just sort of combinations of open-source
feeds and you know where their analysts

159
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:35,010
look at it very quickly and in a lot of
its pretty low quality so you end up

160
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:40,620
with tons of false positives in in in
it's sort of a war there you know you

161
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:45,750
have your analyst ernie busy as how and
you know and then they're cheating out

162
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:51,460
on this phone spas it is so so you have
to be very careful when every use data

163
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:56,780
like that and it's definitely useful but
the hard part is figuring out the stuff

164
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:02,910
that that is going to be useful to you
or is relevant to your network in in in

165
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:07,469
terms of relevancy the way that I see it
is that we have this universal external

166
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:15,150
threat data / Intel right then we have
your organization in so maybe there is

167
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:20,430
you know their stuff going on in your
work that probably isn't out there to

168
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:24,569
meet you there is little overlap so
you're buying this big play threat Intel

169
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:29,330
feed thing in it you're getting some
value out of that put you know really

170
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,500
your goal is

171
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:36,430
son something like this where you know
you want to be having threat in tell

172
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:41,050
that you're buying or creating and you
want to be relevant to your work and so

173
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:45,859
really the only solution is to be taking
it in house and you cannot outsource

174
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:51,700
threat intelligence you have to have the
people that are familiar with your

175
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:57,930
network understanding who your potential
add this series are you know the only

176
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:03,479
way to really do this like if if your
organization wants to do threat or if

177
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,260
you want to do it on your own you really
have to have to use the data that you

178
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:12,490
have internally because you know that's
going to generate the most relevant

179
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:20,990
intelligence for you so in the other
things why you'd want to create it

180
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:28,290
internally as key pls happy there are
you working in a sock or someplace like

181
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:33,360
that it's a very monotonous boring job
and then you can burn out really easy

182
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:41,410
easily and so adding you know giving
analysts a chance to step back and not

183
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:45,360
be judged on the number of tickets that
they open or closed

184
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,010
really stead stepping back looking at
the big picture seeing if they're seeing

185
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:56,339
trends across tickets or reading about
something on the internet and then

186
00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:02,339
seeing is that attacked affecting our
our or so it really helps you know keeps

187
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:11,449
keeps you guys happy in this minimizes
the burnout thats its associated with

188
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:18,550
this weather with these types of jobs
right so so so that's just a quick

189
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:23,990
overview of what threat Intel is in is
not what I mean I think the big question

190
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:28,040
is why you are came here was or how can
I start doing this cool thing is whether

191
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,980
it be supported my my my

192
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:37,500
organization or not so I have like seven
steps here to get you all started so the

193
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,929
first one is is you know really get the
basics first this isn't a subtle mean

194
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:47,360
that I found a black hills intersect
forgot to put the reference there but

195
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:55,178
you know really if you have a shitty
security posture and you try to throw

196
00:17:55,809 --> 00:18:00,149
intel on top of that you know it's
really not gonna help you too much so

197
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:04,220
you really gotta get the basics don't
first and then just simple stuff like

198
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,830
don't run as admin

199
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:14,270
change default passwords if you're on a
Windows systems and keep your patches

200
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:18,570
up-to-date run basic I don't want to see
any virus but maybe like endpoint

201
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:23,750
security solutions that happens to
incorporate any bias because that gives

202
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:27,630
you that incorporates like local

203
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:35,330
firewalls an idea systems as well so
it's all very use use for any reason why

204
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:40,570
you want to do this is because there's a
lot of data that you need to do threat

205
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:47,980
in intel and you need these basic
security mechanism set up so that

206
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:52,470
whatever you're looking at things you
have the data to reference to to dig

207
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:55,470
into these cases of a bit deeper

208
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:04,580
obviously there's the network aspects of
that to use of things like italy hosts

209
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:11,540
level but also at the things like
firewalls and in you know email type

210
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:19,320
blogs and stuff like that all these logs
are very important so hopefully you got

211
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:25,000
that doing so step two is identify you
know some portion of your team that's

212
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,160
going to focus on their intelligence

213
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:35,210
pumpkin pie I love especially when you
put a little bit with cream on there

214
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:41,770
rights to some portion of your team in
inter alia like my portions on the right

215
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:48,139
hand side so some portion of your team
has to focus on this now there's many

216
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:54,190
different ways maybe there's people that
that within your or they are just you

217
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:57,400
know hey there are nine to five er they
just want to come in and do their job

218
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:02,650
and go home in their goal is to just
straight tickets and move on rates so

219
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:07,290
maybe those are the rates and then maybe
you have people within your

220
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:13,770
organization's probably people to come
to conferences like Carolina Klein that

221
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:18,330
are really into it and really want to
dig deeper so if you have something like

222
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:18,909
that

223
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:23,600
set up maybe it's worth it you know
sectioning off part of that team maybe

224
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,010
you want to do something like RA out of
an eight hour shift maybe two of those

225
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:33,980
hours can be focused on it is stepping
back and looking at the big picture so

226
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:41,860
however whatever fits for your
organization definitely do that with

227
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:47,889
this figure out you know some part of
their job each day is associated with

228
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:56,250
threat in doing threat intelligence type
stuff right so so the next thing you

229
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,270
want to do is you know most people in
the world may not know that much about

230
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:03,910
threat Intel so where do these people
start out so you know the first thing to

231
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:10,410
do is is just do a search on the
internet for Lake apt read reports or

232
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:15,140
whatever you know that vendors come out
with them all the time you know it start

233
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:21,690
reading through those in an identity
identifying you know analyzing that in

234
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:26,520
in in looking at how how they did their
analysis you know how they broke the

235
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:31,670
tack down in you know in another big
bonfire party that is saying well if

236
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:38,210
this thread actor associated with this
campaign was attacked us you know would

237
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:42,650
we have been able to detect Indore
Indore stop this

238
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:49,820
and you can use information like this to
to talk to your leadership to basically

239
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:54,439
say you know hey well if they would have
attacked us we would have been blind you

240
00:21:54,440 --> 00:22:00,390
can use out for me get funding well yeah
but just just really get out there and

241
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:04,150
start reading get involved in the
community I think something that I want

242
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:07,690
to add in the shooting here is like
maybe a good place to fix follow on

243
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:12,060
Twitter and blogs I have all that stuff
I just don't know that this presentation

244
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:16,500
yet so the other part of this is
training and really there there is I

245
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:21,240
haven't really found too many training
programs that focus on doing threat

246
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:29,420
Intel of course in a sense came out with
one I think about six months back so you

247
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:32,660
know that's probably a good place to
start but if you don't have you know

248
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:37,910
five green then I don't know what you're
going to do so well yeah then there's

249
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:44,770
there's take part in industry event so
there are a few threat intelligence base

250
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:50,590
comment is they may want to get involved
in or they could be mailing list

251
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:59,100
basically just jump in feet first and
try to learn as much as possible about

252
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:06,719
you can't sue so be it so basically all
this knowledge that you have the next

253
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:13,040
thing is depicted in analysis framework
in this is the key to your investigation

254
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,950
this is gonna leave how you doing here

255
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:19,520
investigations and it's also gonna allow
you to pluck data out of your

256
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:25,290
traditional investigation and at least
kind of put these but daddy information

257
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:31,080
in buckets you can look at the data in
different ways so we're going to work

258
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:36,040
where we're gonna play name that chain
so can anyone guess what the top last

259
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:42,570
one is yes and that's the Lockheed
Martin's overkill teen any word about

260
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:45,570
the one on the rate

261
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:56,990
yeah so that's a diamond model and then
what about the one on the bottom left

262
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:05,540
there is a newer when they actually
decide about two months ago I was heard

263
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,770
candy like when I teach class I use it

264
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:12,629
candy that I can throw out whenever
people answer questions yes this is

265
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:20,760
guess JPMorgan they came out the road
kill teen so like I said I i do so that

266
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:25,580
about two months ago and then what about
the bottom rate is when you may have

267
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:37,500
seen it so so this is the gardener and
they called the attack the gardeners

268
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:41,570
cyberattacks chain hurry so I think a
lot of people

269
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:48,168
industry as a whole is has really gone
to the the Lockheed Martin Feldstein

270
00:24:48,169 --> 00:24:54,549
there are definitely some some
criticisms of it you know in in also

271
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:56,650
with any of these models

272
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:07,210
none of them are perfect so there's some
other ones here in this good cos you can

273
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:12,610
take these back and figure out like a
witch one of these works for me so does

274
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:23,379
anybody know where the one on the top
left is that ICS kill chain so they have

275
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:29,240
a kind of a two-phase approach in the
first phase is just getting in in the

276
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:35,910
second is a will there is a speech there
is a particular ICS system in developing

277
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:40,919
an attack associated with it well what
about the red one in the middle I don't

278
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:43,480
have a room so I did you get vertical

279
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:51,670
is anyone in response here is a look
familiar

280
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:03,070
you know well maybe but this is me
indians

281
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:09,160
attack lifecycle you tell by the color
color rate in Inwood about the one on

282
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:28,410
the rate per se is the insider kill
chain anybody have any idea what the

283
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:39,000
bottom line is we kinda worried
exploitation see to action next

284
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,340
filtration

285
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:46,199
so what's another big industry thing
that's been going on for the past few

286
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:55,800
years that everyone's complaining about
the TV series here this is the cloud

287
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:02,629
guilty so so basically there's a Kill
Team for everything and you know it none

288
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:08,150
of these are right you know what I
encourage you

289
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:15,050
is to go out study these different
chains or bottles and figure out what

290
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:23,740
works for you based on what you see in
in how the adversaries are attacking you

291
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:32,140
start with 18 immediate the perfect one
and you can adjust it as time goes on in

292
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:39,760
it but it really gives you a nice way of
allowing analysts to dig deeper in

293
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:51,670
what's going on so the model they did I
wake up I was create my own guillotine

294
00:27:52,509 --> 00:27:57,909
I would probably do you like the
Lockheed Martin win just a start with

295
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:02,849
Martin when you know you basically just
fly through its like recon weaponization

296
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:09,439
delivery expectation install CT you
intend an action on directives you know

297
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,659
so the first part of that happens like
really fast

298
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:19,779
inane action on objectives could be days
months whatever so I think there need to

299
00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:24,999
be like a few steps in between Oct 08
action on directives in most cases

300
00:28:24,999 --> 00:28:31,279
action on directives means you're either
gonna in most cases it's gonna chill

301
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:36,190
data but that's not always the case
because you could go into manipulate

302
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:43,779
data to depending on what your goals are
so I kind of took that and it looked at

303
00:28:43,779 --> 00:28:46,899
especially the gardener one you know
Gardner tried to take the Lockheed

304
00:28:46,899 --> 00:28:54,109
Martin kill kill chain in in a few steps
in there between the CTX filtration

305
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:59,329
steps in the end and I kinda like some
of the naming her some of the wording

306
00:28:59,329 --> 00:29:03,469
that they used in the fraud kill chain
in until I die I just came up with this

307
00:29:03,469 --> 00:29:09,809
one last night so you know and I added
in its basically the normal CKC with

308
00:29:09,809 --> 00:29:18,119
access so she is like hey I'm gonna move
laterally within the network media after

309
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:24,279
it is my privilege is to do that and
then in gaining access to it and then

310
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:27,369
the last phase could either be once I
have access I'm either gonna

311
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:34,529
manipulated or I'm gonna try to fill it
so but that's just one but I encourage

312
00:29:34,529 --> 00:29:38,789
you to just go and does look through all
these and treat women make it up

313
00:29:38,789 --> 00:29:44,219
yourself take take the best of the ones
that you awake and district working with

314
00:29:44,219 --> 00:29:50,049
it so the next you like earlier when I
was talking about

315
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:55,839
ever knew and how you know we have the
CNC name of the threat intelligence

316
00:29:55,839 --> 00:30:02,009
platform now so so so this is where I'm
spent a good amount of time here cuz I

317
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:02,919
think this is

318
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:07,759
you know where you really need to focus
a lot of that other stuff can go pretty

319
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:10,739
quickly but you know this

320
00:30:10,739 --> 00:30:14,529
trying to decide what sort of platform
your YouTube and is all this data in is

321
00:30:14,529 --> 00:30:21,669
important so I went to Gartner again in
an time to lock in a nice death

322
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:29,450
definition of threat intelligence
platform is so it collects threat

323
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:35,429
intelligence data it retains its for
analysis and it allows functions so you

324
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:40,909
can normalize in in rigid in in and you
can link the data in different ways and

325
00:30:40,909 --> 00:30:44,679
of course you know search and query
interfaces that you can find stuff

326
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:51,299
quickly and then lastly disturbing you
get distributed disseminate data so that

327
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:57,389
if you would want to share with
providers or or reformat the data in

328
00:30:57,389 --> 00:31:02,918
certain ways that you can push it out to
to to the counter measures implemented

329
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:08,399
senior infrastructure so that connect
that's just another company that does

330
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:14,969
the intelligence they have you know like
a simple simpler description where

331
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:21,419
you're gonna aggregated so it can be
less and it could be commercial stuff or

332
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:27,239
it could be shared and then analyzed it
they have a lot of different ways of

333
00:31:27,239 --> 00:31:35,980
linking the data you can analyze it and
get around to discover things in

334
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:41,169
enacting know what you're going to do
with that so getting back to my my son

335
00:31:41,169 --> 00:31:45,799
little ever ever new experiment and you
can really see on the left hand side but

336
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:48,918
that's sort of what it look it looks
like on the rate I tried to blow it up

337
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:54,019
some but it essentially you know I
created this year Greg step in and they

338
00:31:54,019 --> 00:31:58,950
broke it down into you just through
trial and error investigations because I

339
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,960
think a lot of stuff a lot here in tow

340
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:06,850
intelligence is gonna come from
investigations that you're currently

341
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:14,000
doing any investigations in includes
more late than some alert that popped up

342
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,300
maybe it's some new attack that you read
about on the internet

343
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,340
additionally maybe it's you know you're
part of an information sharing

344
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:27,449
partnership in a new get some Intel that
way so investigations income this is all

345
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:32,930
those then lastly early in 2nd you know
putting everything into campaigns and

346
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:38,710
then finally turning out the different
campaigns to the series and then using

347
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:43,470
the getting things done in secret weapon
thing that I told you about earlier

348
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:47,150
being able to come up with this
hierarchical tagging structure so that

349
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:58,270
you can categorize the data in different
ways so you know based on priority using

350
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:04,650
the these secret weapon used as sort of
a who what why where type structure and

351
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:09,610
then there are some tags associated with
that so when is maybe the priority that

352
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:14,649
you're going to associate with it where
is I kinda look at that is

353
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:19,700
is more like in the secret weapon it's
more of a kind of like oh I'm at the

354
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:24,640
grocery store in the grocery store I
need to get bananas but here I

355
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:29,040
interpreted it as is sort of where in
the workflow process maybe there's an

356
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,870
inbox maybe there's something that
currently being it's currently active

357
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:39,080
were being worked in there are things
that are clues in NY so these are the

358
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:45,710
different they're kinda like projects
but so so I use this if it's hard to

359
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:47,290
break things down by

360
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:53,360
investigation Tony campaign tell you
this area and indicator type and then

361
00:33:53,360 --> 00:34:00,129
there's also who simply who worked on it
but this is just a really works in very

362
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:05,400
simple situations so I came out with
this you know like late last year I was

363
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:10,040
presenting on how do you ever knew to do
all this and I came out with this very

364
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:14,400
complex structure where I was trying to
take over Newton like it's going to be

365
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:22,700
200 s in database and table for sharing
it is going to collect logs and I'm

366
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:26,620
gonna make it a sin to a certain extent
it's still doing a lot of these things

367
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:32,409
but I simplified it tremendously so here
we have the case tracking indicator

368
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:39,040
database and database and as you can
tell you know to be done but it gets

369
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:48,370
very complicated very sad so so so it
sort of went back to my roots and took

370
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:54,359
the lessons learn you here so no one
really like the basics of threat

371
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:59,980
intelligence that I see are they gonna
start out with attacks and then or in

372
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:04,060
this case of tax can also be
investigations and then you're good

373
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:09,340
you're gonna be able to make those
together to identify potential campaigns

374
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:15,670
and then campaigns when you get enough
of those associated and and and

375
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:21,150
you can happen if those together maybe
you can nap them to it at this area and

376
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:28,900
and determine what their teepees are so
I simplified it tremendously interest

377
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:33,770
was created tip from scratch these are
the things that I would really really

378
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:37,670
want so I have my attacks or
investigations that I would just be

379
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:41,750
recording same as we're doing today

380
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:49,240
you know and then periodically being
able to go in and identify campaigns in

381
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:53,540
then also trying to discover that
adversaries from that and what their GDP

382
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:58,619
czar and then from that you get your
relevant in in town the indicators which

383
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:00,569
we talked about it here

384
00:36:00,569 --> 00:36:06,540
chairman of pain earlier those are sorta
like the mitochondria in that hold

385
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:14,160
everything together so ideally what I
was doing was I was trying to look for a

386
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:19,259
way that I could get around so I could
start with say a particular attack and I

387
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,349
can say will let in

388
00:36:20,349 --> 00:36:25,430
indicators are associated with that
attacker I could start with the camp and

389
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:29,029
see what attacks are associated with it

390
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:33,640
campaign and who's the adversary
associated with that is what the

391
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:38,920
indicators are sued essentially allowed
you to start from any source and

392
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,440
determine other stuff

393
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,349
associated with it in that allows you to
see the see the gaps and fill in where

394
00:36:46,349 --> 00:36:51,730
you need so that turned out to something
like this where created basically

395
00:36:51,730 --> 00:37:01,520
database schema here where you have the
street indicators attacks campaign and

396
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:11,030
adversary tables and indicators maps to
attacks on the second one the attacks to

397
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:17,480
the campaign aims game paintings to the
series then finally just the information

398
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:25,150
about the adversary and so do the things
that are in parentheses there those are

399
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:27,470
that's data that could be der

400
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:32,359
derived and so I was just trying to get
if you are where if I was an analyst

401
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:40,900
what I want to see well maybe it would
be these pages and there's the data

402
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:47,020
would be based on an act like an attack
idea but I could also get off that to

403
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:55,070
determine indicators or adversaries in
the case of the attacks table so I tried

404
00:37:55,070 --> 00:38:02,980
to simplify that more easily looks like
this I have I guess the colors brown

405
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:08,260
there but late I added in some other
things that I thought were important so

406
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:15,230
especially with your indicators you have
the separate guilty in fees so whatever

407
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:21,369
phase or or whatever your framework is
so whenever you extracted indicator you

408
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:28,700
really need to make educated guesses on
what the attack teen its associated with

409
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:35,098
it in there is also note so nigga too
complicated to decide this big text area

410
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:39,380
where you could just trade notes then
and then also tagging really try to keep

411
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:45,720
that structure and I did the same thing
with these attacks stable campaigns

412
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:50,750
table an adversary table and so it ends
up you know looking something like this

413
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:57,690
so you can easily take this structure
and may be treated in access or whatever

414
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:05,339
you have access to but ideally you would
really want you know hopefully there's a

415
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:12,920
product out there that we did you know
collect all the sordid data so so

416
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:17,060
another thing that I did was really
going out and looking at all the

417
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:22,660
different products in things that are in
services that are out there so so on the

418
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:26,950
bottom so on the vertical axis he's
there there's just some base you know

419
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:33,319
information tape systems that can be
adapted into a tip vs you know

420
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:40,180
away add at the top where inhabit it
it's designed to be a idiot and then of

421
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:44,660
course on the horizontal axis you get
you know commercial or paid money for

422
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:50,098
versus free until there is there is a
lot of different solutions that are out

423
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:55,609
there and the solutions that you pick is
you know first on what you have access

424
00:39:55,609 --> 00:39:59,209
to you know maybe you have asked the
Splunk just sitting there and and no

425
00:39:59,209 --> 00:40:04,469
one's really using it that much and
where you have add admin add access to

426
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:10,579
it so you can use slice off a little
piece of that and go use that maybe same

427
00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:14,959
thing with the seem like you're using
awesome were choosing arts or whatever

428
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:20,058
sim rate and maybe they would let you
use that or if you happened

429
00:40:20,059 --> 00:40:25,660
operator you can just build it used that
you know their SharePoint you know most

430
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:29,589
organizations have a SharePoint

431
00:40:29,589 --> 00:40:35,009
intense and you can create your own
websites in in order I hate SharePoint

432
00:40:35,009 --> 00:40:39,949
you know if you have nothing it's it's
it's you know it's better than nothing

433
00:40:39,949 --> 00:40:45,109
right so it's a place to start so you
can at least maybe start their show the

434
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:49,769
value that its that you're learning from
it and maybe you can get some funding to

435
00:40:49,769 --> 00:40:56,609
to you some other resources on the
bottom rate there is my little ever knew

436
00:40:56,609 --> 00:40:59,219
things really cheap

437
00:40:59,219 --> 00:41:04,890
50 bucks a year or whatever you know to
you something like that maybe you could

438
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:14,229
use like a week e there's so the Elks
stat is everybody with that just just a

439
00:41:14,229 --> 00:41:22,959
nice big data type structure that that
you can put Dina in insert into its

440
00:41:22,959 --> 00:41:30,190
similar to Splunk but it's open source
their scouts TV which I can awake that

441
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:36,339
cuz it's a new sequel so I realized that
at least starting out I'm not gonna know

442
00:41:36,339 --> 00:41:41,920
what I need rate I like something that
like these new sequel deed basis there

443
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:47,949
are flexible so if later I decided that
I need ads saying I can just add a

444
00:41:47,949 --> 00:41:56,069
column for it and it doesn't break the
whole system so there is there's me into

445
00:41:56,069 --> 00:42:01,739
in the top rate which was a reference
implementation of a tip but I don't see

446
00:42:01,739 --> 00:42:08,680
it being developed that much there's
credits which is a system there are no

447
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:12,448
other open source solution that you
might want to check out I really haven't

448
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:22,469
had too much luck with that but you know
you may want to try it they are a hard

449
00:42:22,469 --> 00:42:26,719
like I try to get it installed in it
just wouldn't work for me but I just

450
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:33,779
found out that they have a darker
container so I need to try that out

451
00:42:33,779 --> 00:42:42,680
there is RTI are so that's just RTI ours
and open-source case management system

452
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:51,078
but so you could possibly tapped out
into your needs and then lastly is a

453
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:55,779
store called threatening into
threatening is being developed cancer

454
00:42:55,779 --> 00:43:01,150
it's Brian and it's why I will do
something like everybody so this is a

455
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:05,759
new tool that was started in September
and like all the little threat

456
00:43:05,759 --> 00:43:12,380
intelligence conference is listed I go
to threaten it seems to be kind of the

457
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:19,999
system right now so although it still in
development but it was easy to get into

458
00:43:19,999 --> 00:43:27,430
the habit of reading done that haven't
posted it yet but it's agree system for

459
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:31,078
starting that out the only thing that I
didn't like about it is it doesn't have

460
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:36,069
a case management system but the guy
that's creating it is very he has

461
00:43:36,869 --> 00:43:42,339
he's developing allowed a integrations
with third party tools so that you can

462
00:43:42,339 --> 00:43:44,828
pull in a lot of like say you put in

463
00:43:44,829 --> 00:43:53,259
indicator in its OS into you can go out
and and I always liked who is data and

464
00:43:53,259 --> 00:43:55,900
also there is a candidate it

465
00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:02,249
case management system in threat Intel
is its past incident response or

466
00:44:02,249 --> 00:44:06,999
referred to the guy that's doing the
threat now he's trying to there isn't

467
00:44:06,999 --> 00:44:12,720
like their those those those two guys
are working to get together so that they

468
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,549
can integrate together nicely

469
00:44:14,549 --> 00:44:21,390
yes so there's a lot of options in it it
it really just starts out with you know

470
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:26,470
hey there's something out there that you
can use already going use it or if you

471
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:30,538
have an extra box later on in stealing
nothing maybe you can throw one of these

472
00:44:30,539 --> 00:44:37,819
open source tools on it right to the
next step is to create the data in this

473
00:44:37,819 --> 00:44:44,589
is basically the same as we've been
doing all these years right to know you

474
00:44:44,589 --> 00:44:50,710
know as they investigate the new attacks
in Reese's information from partners

475
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:56,319
analyzing these just like they normally
normally would but there's one small

476
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:00,180
difference it's inserted just
investigating it may be trying to dig a

477
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:04,960
little deeper deeper and also pulling
the indicators out and and turning to

478
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:10,289
map them to whatever intelligence
framework that you're doing so in this

479
00:45:10,289 --> 00:45:13,349
case you know so

480
00:45:13,349 --> 00:45:18,849
investigations may be so the ax
represents where we actually stopped in

481
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:25,400
tax rate so in this case we stopped
there in normally that would be like a

482
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:32,759
baby work trade with a median a little
deeper and looking at it will help W in

483
00:45:32,759 --> 00:45:38,180
the final came from a trip balls dot com
and it was going to be one

484
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:44,609
jet I dot com check out this clip of me
right then maybe we go through our web

485
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:51,220
server logs and we see this this Viper
user agent was you know around the scene

486
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:58,520
like a few days before I got this email
sorry we basically got some stuff there

487
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:04,530
rather than just seen ya ain't got it
and move on but the important part is we

488
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:08,540
are pulling the indicators out of what
we know and we're documenting it into

489
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:13,310
some framework of sorts year to year
analysts will just go and create

490
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:20,529
indicators as a tax stuff you know what
these additional steps is applying the

491
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:27,340
indicators to the chain so eventually
you get somebody to step back doing some

492
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:30,880
of the threat in to work and to look
across everything and it basically turns

493
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,910
out to be something like this where you
have three attacks in you start looking

494
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:41,879
at similarities between them so the
first one is like hey look these two

495
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:48,990
packs one-in-five nap in these
particular ways you know we as the booth

496
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:55,700
using that that scene email the Lady
Rebels dot com and in in the exploit has

497
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:58,990
to do with some video that has a hole in
it

498
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:07,100
you your kind of mapping that to some
other and other attacking you see tire

499
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:14,660
66 for install that was both in a tax
files in nineteen men for the c2 they're

500
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:22,620
not exactly the same IP but they're
within the same same class C in then is

501
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:27,190
is part of that third one you may be
there is an expo associated with that

502
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:30,470
such as living dead I dot XLS going out
to another

503
00:47:31,069 --> 00:47:39,219
I T which is in that seem classy so
you're looking at this in pulling these

504
00:47:39,219 --> 00:47:46,079
attacks together we can call this ad
campaign and then we can get a good idea

505
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:56,119
that they use these viper things to go
out and and do you recall I really don't

506
00:47:56,119 --> 00:48:00,739
know too much about maybe weaponization
maybe like they'd like to use the you

507
00:48:00,739 --> 00:48:07,459
hosting sites or maybe they're delivered
by email through like that the malicious

508
00:48:07,459 --> 00:48:15,368
attachment and you know delivery they're
coming from this reptiles dot com they'd

509
00:48:15,369 --> 00:48:22,549
like to use this particular rat called
tire 66 and then the c2 is associated

510
00:48:22,549 --> 00:48:28,809
with that I he and in their usually the
goal in this campaign was to find other

511
00:48:28,809 --> 00:48:36,039
living jet jet jet I they mean anyone
had so really this is so we can kind of

512
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:41,579
summarize that campaign in that so what
you are doing is you get enough of these

513
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:46,160
campaigns and just like he went from a
tax to campaigns you can start to see

514
00:48:46,869 --> 00:48:56,739
attack campaigns to your adversaries are
your attackers and really understand you

515
00:48:56,739 --> 00:49:00,549
know they're like how they do things you
know like you don't necessarily have to

516
00:49:00,549 --> 00:49:06,779
be identified as oh it's you know Joe in
China in this is his blog rate you don't

517
00:49:06,779 --> 00:49:11,459
we don't really care about that but it's
really just understanding you know how

518
00:49:11,459 --> 00:49:14,348
they do things so that whenever

519
00:49:14,349 --> 00:49:19,940
based on what you've learned you can see
these into your account into your ideas

520
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:21,950
systems are here I ES is in

521
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:28,839
and so when in attack box instead of it
like this just random attack it could be

522
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:36,210
you know you could classify it as like
this is attacker EBC Associated like

523
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:43,380
they're doing the orders 66 campaign
against it in then you learn more and

524
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:48,170
more and more about them so the more
they attack you learn more about them

525
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:55,640
talk about measuring progress here but
but there's some good models that are

526
00:49:55,640 --> 00:50:04,040
out there so lucky to go look up at the
Lockheed Martin kill chain paper there

527
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:08,500
is a lot of ways that they have for
classifying the day

528
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:16,920
data and deep determining you know
basically the goal is to stop the Tigers

529
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:22,200
sooner in the kill chain versus later
and so you can measure that and into

530
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,000
your progress that way there's also DML

531
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:31,460
cut the grass care obviously but that's
a detection maturity level that's

532
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:38,250
another one that is out there so there
is a lot of ways I haven't really seen

533
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:42,780
as you can tell here but but there's
some interesting ways that you can do it

534
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:48,099
so good in conclusion you know I think
like if you're gonna build your own

535
00:50:48,099 --> 00:50:53,869
threat until system you know first you
know fine UNC buddies that wanna do is

536
00:50:53,869 --> 00:50:58,510
try to get me and it's been by and/or
just do it yourself use the resources

537
00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:04,210
that you always do you already have
access to learn as much as possible

538
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:11,890
about what set it hopefully this its
presentation is is a start to that

539
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:16,509
inspire and then finally as you as you
doing here

540
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:21,349
investigations you know don't display
why whack-a-mole really just you know

541
00:51:21,349 --> 00:51:26,910
dig a little deeper and and as you doing
your investigations fill out the

542
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:28,379
indicators in

543
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:35,730
in whatever their how those indicators
fit in whatever change you happen to be

544
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:45,480
using and then take a step back look
across all those are the different tax

545
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:50,759
look for patterns you know than to
identify campaigns and then from those

546
00:51:50,759 --> 00:51:55,769
came from multiple can campaigns you
know try to push back and and and

547
00:51:55,769 --> 00:52:02,419
identify adversary teepees so that's all
that I have I just want to give a big

548
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:10,400
shout-out to Carolina client for having
me see so you can reach me on Twitter so

549
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:17,769
grax website there and if you wanna
contact me I have a contact form on my

550
00:52:17,769 --> 00:52:23,029
website but he directly in communities
hit me up on Twitter or you can just do

551
00:52:23,029 --> 00:52:36,079
grax at Nova intersect dot com so are
there any questions yes yeah

552
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:43,420
yeah

553
00:52:55,810 --> 00:53:02,680
yeah there's a good so that there's some
threat in tow books have been dug deep

554
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,080
into them so I don't have a
recommendation by but there's a guy that

555
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:10,920
there's going to be one and I should
have put it in the name of it but if you

556
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:17,950
pay me you know like a deathly signed it
so coming in it's Kyle Knox something

557
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:23,299
but he and a few other people that I
