1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,759
all three days of waste your money is
Randy purposes of a stop and the I'm

2
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,220
doing a talk called never go full
spectrum cyber

3
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:42,469
live and work in Sunnyvale trailer part
of some cheeseburgers

4
00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:49,010
they got some cheeseburgers ramp up here
right now

5
00:00:51,290 --> 00:01:07,069
liquor do the thinking he's not here but
anyway your honor with full spectrum

6
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:11,750
cyber is I couldn't tell you but I will
tell you that Northrop Grumman sells it

7
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:31,179
can get to know the divergence has given
no relevant xkcd you can read that

8
00:01:31,179 --> 00:01:35,750
basically says you have a huge budget
can figure out cyber was you know you're

9
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:42,320
tired like a decade ago so so little
disclaimer just because I'm really

10
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:49,798
talked about doing illegal things things
or do you want to go to jail that's on

11
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:58,479
you so and if you do report any old
legal activity to InfoSec Mr Leahy and

12
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:06,060
he'll respond appropriately probably by
drinking I so story time I'm gonna

13
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,540
basically just talk about people who
have gone full spectrum cyber first one

14
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:19,310
is going to re-sign Roy was a guy who
was pretty successful guy graduated in

15
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:24,350
2010 from Purdue with electrical
engineering degree he went on to

16
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:31,880
graduate program at Boston University AV
did very well for himself straight days

17
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:39,569
the whole time but enough is last
semester at school he never even

18
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:45,660
attended class except maybe one of them
turns out he was stealing his profes-

19
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:55,930
professor is teachers credentials and
Mike and basically changing is great

20
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:03,280
anyplace they got away with them he
graduated he moved on to go on a gradual

21
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,680
it also had a friend of his name

22
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,200
Mitsukoshi sure our sake he was also
further east side he was an

23
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:18,209
international exchange student and he
also had very high grades well look he

24
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:22,940
got busted and it turned out he was
using keyloggers whose installing

25
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:28,109
keyloggers and professors and professors
office is he was picking locks to their

26
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:33,150
doors in a story like a replacement
keyboard and that's how he was gonna

27
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:41,160
credentials what turned out so she had
learned this whole thing from Roy Roy

28
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:48,380
had taught him how to pick locks how to
find similar or identical keyboards to

29
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,660
the ones that the professors were using
buy them install a keylogger devices in

30
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,980
them

31
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,030
reagan's of their officers when they
were there and replace the keyboard or

32
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:03,110
the one that did the key logging calls
going great so we're getting straight

33
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:12,890
A's and they're getting away with it and
we got car was he for whatever reason

34
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:17,140
that we could idea I guess he didn't
like the password the professor is using

35
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,289
so he decided to reset the professors
password

36
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:25,560
not once but twice and after the second
time the repressor got like a little

37
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,650
suspicious and called the helpdesk he
was like why does my password keep

38
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,440
getting reset I'm not the one doing it
so they look at the logs and they see

39
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,770
somebody was doing it from an IP address
in the IP address happened to be the

40
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:43,640
university's student or public wifi but
you have to have University account to

41
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,960
sign into

42
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:58,539
so obviously they throw directly back to
MIT so she could there so she gets

43
00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:03,250
pulled into an office he immediately
tells them everything how he was doing

44
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,860
it also about Roy Roy top though how to
do it

45
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:16,630
charge lost got kicked out of school
lost his degree at Purdue got kicked out

46
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:21,909
of the graduate program at Boston
University there was another guy sharma

47
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:26,470
he was actually just standing lookout
while the other guy probing the other

48
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:32,880
professors office and he got one of his
greatest change he also got busted but

49
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,630
the best part is we got busted kicked
out of school after got away with it and

50
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,250
the mistletoe she has international
exchange student flies back to Japan

51
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:45,389
before we can even face trial so the guy
you screwed up for everybody gets is

52
00:05:45,389 --> 00:06:05,130
basically a home in Japan right now so
next guy's got his last name yeah I was

53
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:09,860
a look at this picture the first thing I
thought was words for Dora and katana

54
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:20,800
get the Little Pony told everything this
guy who's this guy was anonymous member

55
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:29,259
or body was and basically he thought it
would be cool to as part of Operation

56
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:35,620
avenged Julian Assange to hack into a
never guard website chapter website in

57
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,310
florida if you're not then whatever
guard their heavily affiliated with the

58
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:51,159
FBI just all so now he's a hack into it
then he tweets about it through the FBI

59
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,569
press office

60
00:06:52,569 --> 00:07:00,539
well yeah so they didn't even have to
look hard to figure out who done it he

61
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:11,899
told them he gets busted so now what
examples are a little bit more amateur

62
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:17,349
hour so I wanna talk even professional
criminals can get busted because

63
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:23,589
especially large operations that require
a lot of people involved you only need a

64
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:29,580
couple idiots to screw up everything for
everyone else so I will talk you may

65
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,990
have heard about this one it's called
the saint petersburg I stores referred

66
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:39,719
to those that basically took place in
late 2012 or early 2013 over forty

67
00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:46,389
million dollars were stolen from two
banks overseas in Mr Amon scares me but

68
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:51,119
bank Muscat and rock bank basically what
happened was hackers have gotten to

69
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:56,209
their payment processor which is based
in India and from there they're able to

70
00:07:56,209 --> 00:08:02,080
still thousands and thousands of card
numbers for prepaid travel cards from

71
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,180
there what happened was they did was
called in limited operation you don't

72
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:11,379
own a limited operation is they
basically take the accounts once they're

73
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:17,240
in the system and remove the withdrawal
limits so you know if you go to ATM and

74
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:23,490
you put your card in your social like a
week in Vegas like your withdrawal sort

75
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,819
him out of my account after a certain
amount your bank usually has a limit on

76
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:33,560
how much you can withdraw per day so you
know it may be $250 so they do they go

77
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:36,159
and take those off seeking withdrawal as
much as possible

78
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:45,860
MTV accounts to do is then they send the
card numbers of two small teams overseas

79
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:50,970
called cash or mule teams will do is a
go ahead and take those card numbers and

80
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:55,939
loading them onto just magistrate
plastic cards you see everyday like a

81
00:08:55,939 --> 00:09:02,680
credit card and then we'll go around to
various ATMs and basically put the cards

82
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,130
and PIN numbers

83
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:09,930
and import as much money as I possibly
can and will go from one atm to the next

84
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:14,130
showing up money and just emptying the
council they do it at a very coordinated

85
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:18,910
fashion usually around the team same
time frame so that the bank has very

86
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:24,930
little time to respond and walk the
accounts so everyone doing all across

87
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:29,329
the world wants all the time the bank
becomes aware of what happened the

88
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:37,730
council already feel like I said where
did this was basically very professional

89
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,510
this wasn't their first time doing it
this was just the largest operation had

90
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:47,630
done that does for the organization and
it is believed to be in st. Petersburg

91
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:54,840
Russia that's why it's called the saint
petersburg operation so yeah anyway like

92
00:09:54,840 --> 00:10:00,730
I said if you like this alot of ppl
involves sometimes its hard to find good

93
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:05,470
help people who know good trade craft
and know what to do and what not to do

94
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:14,200
so there is one guy based out of New
York City New York City Ellis Rodriguez

95
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:22,260
he basically went around and he is
wearing his dominoes pizza cap he worked

96
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:28,980
for Domino's Pizza so he went to all the
ATMs in front of all the ATM cameras I

97
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,980
mean everyone knows they have cameras
didn't wear sunglasses didn't wear

98
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:37,780
anything just walked up to about the
money as Domino's Pizza cap on Saturday

99
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:43,640
how does for face and they had a clue
where he worked from there they were

100
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:48,189
able to figure out where he was he was
busy just go through to get a dominoes

101
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:54,350
and say hey do you have any employees
matching this description they bust him

102
00:10:54,350 --> 00:11:01,070
they find on his cell phone pictures
with him and his other friends that were

103
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:06,270
in the house with piles of cash and also
he was walking around with like

104
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:11,500
expensive Rolexes like $40,000 Rolexes
and driving a new car which is not too

105
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:16,200
bad for someone to deliver pizzas for
dominance might stand out a little bit

106
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:24,910
basically it once they got to him they
were able to find his computer found the

107
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:30,000
email addresses back to the organization
the main organization and Russia and

108
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,140
everybody else on his team went down
with them not just also their leader was

109
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:42,689
also located Dominican Republic had fled
back he got killed before he could face

110
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:49,560
trial funny enough he was playing a game
of dominoes and apparently someone had

111
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,400
found out he'd come into some money
through the highs and he basically in a

112
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:59,810
botched robbery it was shot dead in a
house like few weeks after this incident

113
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,680
occurred

114
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,910
his whole team right now the only reason
we probably can attribute the attack to

115
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:13,030
the organization and st. Petersburg
Russia's cuz they were able to catch

116
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:18,490
elvis and if the leader hadn't got
killed had gotten of killed before then

117
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:26,370
they can get him back further into the
organization so

118
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:38,770
squad I don't know for sure these guys
they're morons they want to be law sex

119
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:46,860
so bad they're not just this is one of
their members this guy goes by the name

120
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:55,190
of obnoxious aka Jesus OB don't know
what that is because he was a minor in

121
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:59,520
Canada his records are sealed so we
don't actually know his real name but

122
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:05,210
his whole thing or stick was he would
swap people constantly you would go and

123
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:08,650
find people that he just doesn't like
the defendant on internet stocks though

124
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:15,319
I know who they are in the system we
have spotted over and over again you can

125
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,610
actually find news articles about us
particularly family harassed constantly

126
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:24,360
because some girl on the internet that
like him and so he decided it was

127
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:32,100
justice was just make her life a living
hell so he constantly had a doc swatted

128
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,870
swatted should leave her University
where she was enrolled she went back to

129
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:44,540
her parents house to live in than their
shoes again swatted at parents house

130
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:48,599
largest capital constantly there is
nothing they can do to stop it now how

131
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,720
many people who are familiar with what
swatting is okay so I don't really need

132
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,040
to explain it but the quick quick
version is basically it when you call

133
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,189
the police

134
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:02,940
pretend that you're like a gunman or
somebody who's threatening a family and

135
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:07,060
just tell the nearly kill somebody if
this much money or whatever that deliver

136
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:11,920
and the cops show up in force for SWAT
gear regular house break down your door

137
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:17,790
England's it you know what's going on in
the problem is the cops have to respond

138
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,300
to this

139
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,349
like they can't just say oh no this
guy's probably doing this problem which

140
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:29,070
is surprising because they they can make
that call so he was getting away with it

141
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:35,040
for a long time until you decide to live
stream on a gaming website

142
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:43,759
and this actually has audio but I'm not
going to share it but yeah it has on a

143
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:52,310
game or streaming website just make each
other for recording of him making the

144
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:57,959
call the police say is going to want
somebody and just the whole thing you

145
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:01,500
want to do a whole rigmarole worries you
know claiming he's a guy is gonna shoot

146
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,220
people to get cash etcetera etcetera

147
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:07,880
there is a hundred people watching the
stream when this happen a few of them

148
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,009
thought the call the cops and say look
this guy's doing this is a hoax and from

149
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:20,720
there they were able to trace it back to
who he was and he got busted so ya next

150
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:30,040
guy edward lee CNN drew aka Wolfenstein
this guy ACTA DOD website 2006 there is

151
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:36,149
pretty actually is pretty sophisticated
he like hawks from other compromise

152
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:41,680
boxes sitting in Japan so that's as far
as they were able to get that you know

153
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,550
they were actors actress from this box
and from there they couldn't go any

154
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,139
further

155
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:51,290
the only food that had was a yahoo email
address that he used somewhere in the

156
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:57,769
attack to identify or so away with it
they're looking for affordable years

157
00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:06,899
then he decides to he needs to find a
job he posed to see be online he decides

158
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:14,860
all the email addresses around I just
put that on my cev are now saying when

159
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:21,040
you use before I guess he forgotten
where he used it and this is what

160
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:32,219
happened immediately arrested the guy
that no other sophisticated attacker

161
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:41,300
being a KFC PYY he'd used an email
address to register domains that were

162
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:46,839
used for command-and-control servers and
he also uses a motorist reginald other

163
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:53,209
accounts at other places including a
Picasso Picasso accountants pictures

164
00:16:53,209 --> 00:17:00,180
exactly what pictures uploaded of him
with other military officials this is

165
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:06,899
how they're able to figure out who apt
was you know one of the military units

166
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:12,990
were because they later on they register
that domain with different emails a

167
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:17,290
scripted but you can just go back to the
domain history of these domains are

168
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:22,829
being used in this attack at the munich
control servers its registered to this

169
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:28,260
we don't know who is registered to now
but six years ago was registered to the

170
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:32,610
email address and then we'll just go
look online they found lots of places or

171
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:37,439
this e-mail address is being used for
reviews they handle CPI YoY

172
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,440
so even a nation state can screw up

173
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:56,830
basically sites were sold people's
identities so he would basically hacking

174
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:00,210
sites consumer was consumer data

175
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,940
consumer data and then sell the
identities of people to anyone who was

176
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:11,559
purchasing most of the people who bought
the dead were also on the you even

177
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:15,779
though he was located the vietnam we
made it clear you look at the vietnam

178
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:21,539
sites then the insula back to other
people in the US who would then use it

179
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:30,370
for tax fraud to fail to file fake tax
refunds which he was going away for

180
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:37,100
years he decided somebody said hey
arkansas you some data without having

181
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,270
here in the USA thought it was a bright
idea to fly to the same country where

182
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:49,010
he'd been hacking for years immediately
arrested as he gets off the face and it

183
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:51,640
turned out the guy who was transformed
it was actually an undercover secret

184
00:18:51,640 --> 00:19:05,110
service station so hilarious bad guys
always screw up my hacks have the room

185
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:14,309
moments this first guy Wesley Weinberg
this is recent actually security was a

186
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:20,100
security researcher and there was a bug
bounty program Facebook had going and

187
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,918
basically Instagram was part of the
scope of the bugbear for the grant

188
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:29,510
program he basically found this message
about the Facebook great I'll going well

189
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:36,220
later he writes on his blog how Facebook
you know don't understand what bug

190
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:42,429
bounty programs are about their you know
for asking him for finding a flaw in

191
00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:47,159
basically you know goes it a scathing
review of our Facebooks hostile toward

192
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:55,130
security researchers and the bug bounty
programs of shame turns out Facebook was

193
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,519
on the up-and-up Facebook

194
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:00,839
basically agreed to pay him for the bug
even though he wasn't even the first one

195
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:04,639
to find it like several people who are
in the same boat and it was just it was

196
00:20:04,639 --> 00:20:07,418
just a basic Ruby code exploit

197
00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:14,139
admin control panel so he finds experts
admit it but then he decides I'm gonna

198
00:20:14,139 --> 00:20:19,769
go ahead and use the exploit back into
the servers get the API keys for the

199
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:25,479
servers for Amazon s3 keys and then
start going to the s3 but it's an

200
00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:30,219
industry buckets and we're going right
and he goes on reports that the face

201
00:20:30,219 --> 00:20:35,639
which is way out of the scope you know
the kids would be on the server I mean

202
00:20:35,639 --> 00:20:42,039
that's where the supposed to go so he
goes way beyond the scope of the exploit

203
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:51,440
basically after that what happened
actually happens West told them away the

204
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,839
whole reason he did that was because he
didn't think he got enough money for the

205
00:20:54,839 --> 00:21:01,158
exploit Facebook first thought they were
fine and dandy start saying well as on

206
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:06,379
of money and also I found this other
data so then Facebook assuming that he

207
00:21:06,379 --> 00:21:10,738
was acting on behalf of his employer
then contacts his employer as employers

208
00:21:10,739 --> 00:21:15,729
like we don't know why is it doing this
except it's an awful lot of trouble so

209
00:21:15,729 --> 00:21:19,139
yeah it's important to stay within scope
when you're doing but many programs

210
00:21:19,139 --> 00:21:23,320
finding an exploit in the news again are
two different things

211
00:21:26,529 --> 00:21:29,549
Roberts the next story

212
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:33,908
problem most of you here heard about
this but if you have it is also goes

213
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:38,759
west side dragon on twitter twitter and
I'm not being too much are chris Roberts

214
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:43,119
is a great guy he's done a lot of good
security research but even when you're

215
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:46,708
really smart person you can do things
that are kind of dumb at least in

216
00:21:46,709 --> 00:21:50,679
retrospect it was flying

217
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:55,469
he'd been doing a lot of research into
airline control systems and

218
00:21:55,469 --> 00:21:57,710
vulnerabilities airline control systems

219
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:06,740
and while he was on a flight he decided
this by myself on a 737 800 let's see

220
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:11,750
source listing all the systems let's see
if we can start playing with you know

221
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:22,559
because messages passages on anyone and
is also on a face you know or whatever I

222
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,500
didn't think that was funny

223
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:33,850
FBI accused of hacking into the point
systems had accused him of other point

224
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:39,240
systems and all that's because he was
well aware of chris Roberts told it had

225
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:45,659
reports the FAA and the past about flaws
that could be an airline likes control

226
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:49,250
systems and how they can be accessed
through the entertainment systems

227
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:57,470
you see so this one are back and forth
later chris Roberts said no I never

228
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:02,080
actually did that that was just a joke
to make a point but even joking can

229
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:09,279
manual of trouble he got into a lot of
legal trouble over this basically when

230
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:13,870
he got off the plane federal right there
waiting for him and detained and

231
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:21,860
questioned of ours said it maintained
that was a literal basis but next year

232
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:26,350
so in legal trouble and maybe related
maybe not related

233
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:31,480
is back his company is security company
called else I'll security was filed for

234
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:38,299
bankruptcy still active but it was sold
off to another is running now so you

235
00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:44,629
know I symbols we can wreck your life
you're not careful and the last four

236
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,520
weeks ago

237
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:54,330
goes David of calcium you work for a
security research group and consulting

238
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:59,740
company in maryland was they were
contracted by the University of Maryland

239
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:06,350
to take a look at their systems he
basically found an exploit and claimed

240
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,179
that he found

241
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:12,810
know we're already on your system which
was probably all true he he basically

242
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:16,740
reported all this and then said that
University of Maryland is ordered and

243
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:23,290
doing about it right at that point
usually got frustrated you know I have

244
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:28,470
to do something about this they're not
going to do anything silly hacks into

245
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:35,110
University of Maryland will be pretty
good upset he used a bunch of VPNs

246
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:40,240
download all the personal information
for like the only security team because

247
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,950
he just wanted to make a point that he
poses a positive spin on line to try and

248
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:50,970
see if it goes on to like take it
seriously was well he also told all his

249
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:55,060
quarters what he was doing what he was
doing it and most of our gonna go way

250
00:24:55,060 --> 00:25:01,669
that's not right you should be doing
that so basically you're able to easily

251
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:05,190
put it on him they knew exactly who put
up a spin because he's the same

252
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:09,640
reliability gets raided by the FBI the
next day his co-workers told the FBI

253
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:17,690
this is a guy who did it he was already
worked for the US Postal doesn't na

254
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:25,440
further admitting guilt gets fired
obviously you know reporters are going

255
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,260
to keep our room for that and still
maintains he did nothing morally wrong

256
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:35,490
so I have some other points to make
later about this stuff but the main

257
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:40,820
winners it's not your job to make a
judgment call as to whether or not your

258
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:46,520
employer's doing enough about security
finding that's their job it's a business

259
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,740
decision and he doesn't know he may have
been in meetings where they're taking it

260
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:55,290
seriously so you send a report they say
hey I found a serious issue and they

261
00:25:55,290 --> 00:26:00,870
take it it's now on you what they do
after just trying to get emotional about

262
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:04,370
it you they're probably going to have
those meetings behind closed doors and

263
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:07,370
you're not going to be involved

264
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:17,039
of SEC later on so yea we'll talk about
what what these guys did and what could

265
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:23,940
they have probably done better in the
future like looking at from hindsight if

266
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,889
you're wondering if you like much like
the chairman of the board to strive for

267
00:26:27,889 --> 00:26:36,580
that is the intelligence of six basic
operational security it's just basic

268
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:43,519
things you need to do basic practices
you have in your daily work routines are

269
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:48,049
met that when you're going through and
doing anything as far as like this even

270
00:26:48,049 --> 00:26:54,990
have to depend as it could be other
things that just keep you secure keep

271
00:26:54,990 --> 00:27:01,309
insulate you protect you from legal
trouble keep you from going getting your

272
00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:07,668
door down getting letters from a bunch
of lawyers basically the first principle

273
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:17,350
is shut the fuck up so this is not a new
concept it's been around for a while

274
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:22,490
probably the first lesson a lot of
practical applications for shutting the

275
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,490
fuck up

276
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:35,000
telling your friends about your legal
activities and then showing how to do it

277
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,220
if you should do something that's bad

278
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:43,190
least implicate yourself and you can
automatically replicate yourself if you

279
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:47,960
start telling them you're expecting your
friends to go to jail for you like

280
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,280
there's not many people I don't have
good friend you are but they're not

281
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,100
gonna go to jail for you especially
their families have their own life story

282
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:59,070
about four inches now obviously maybe
not live streaming thing you really like

283
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:03,169

about your legal activities this would

284
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:10,710
help you keeps you from getting busted
in my diary said no trust anyone to risk

285
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:15,420
jail for you and this goes as far as
just telling stories are a lot of us get

286
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:19,650
especially comprises a lot of us get
inebriated and we start telling stories

287
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:26,470
we want to browse everyone wants to tell
everyone how you know packer pen tester

288
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:32,800
they are you sure you don't know who's
listening who is reporting and so even

289
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:38,379
something you may think it's fairly
innocent someone else right and even if

290
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:43,100
it does later determined that what you
there wasn't so bad you still just went

291
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:49,330
through a lot of grief because you told
the wrong person next morgan is

292
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:56,850
basically compartmentalization alright
or as if you listen to rap music I got

293
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:01,189
two phones a great song basically rapper
Bob sec

294
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:12,399
I got two phones and help me out here

295
00:29:20,169 --> 00:29:26,049
keep your various operations
compartmentalized don't like keep

296
00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:31,908
everything separate IRA is that why you
keep the threads going back to your

297
00:29:31,909 --> 00:29:39,700
operations separated or dead ends on
your travel our first one is create

298
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,759
cover it is a person is when you operate
online alright so like you saw earlier

299
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:50,220
with the email addresses people were
using EViews identity episode online use

300
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:54,080
it for that operationally and then when
you done with it

301
00:29:54,080 --> 00:30:00,299
get rid of it never use it again because
then if you use it again

302
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:03,820
leave a clue to your identity and one
operation but that's not a that's not

303
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,158
enough right to get to come back to you

304
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,639
back on you when you do something else
later on that you leave another clue to

305
00:30:10,639 --> 00:30:14,439
your identity you put the two together
and now they know exactly who you are

306
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:23,369
right that's also part of contamination
if you if you put information about the

307
00:30:23,369 --> 00:30:26,509
persona que that you could contaminate
the persona by either linking that

308
00:30:26,509 --> 00:30:30,249
persona to other person is that you're
using or back to your personal identity

309
00:30:30,249 --> 00:30:35,850
that's one that really really hard to do
some of these things are real simple

310
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:40,049
things like posting pictures online
under persona that you've taken that

311
00:30:40,049 --> 00:30:45,440
still has the made in the tag like the
geolocation data just talking in a chat

312
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,200
rooms somebody in mentioning personal
details right that our actual real

313
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:55,919
details that may seem innocuous by
themselves but if you go back to the

314
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,049
chat logs and get enough whether he
could someone not information of trace

315
00:31:00,049 --> 00:31:04,269
back to your identity and the biggest
one is keep your personal life separate

316
00:31:04,269 --> 00:31:10,379
don't use the same device your personal
device to do anything that that it

317
00:31:10,379 --> 00:31:14,658
because it's gonna increment you go back
to the guy Elvis who was sitting there

318
00:31:14,659 --> 00:31:18,649
taking he had no tradecraft whatsoever
like basic things like don't take

319
00:31:18,649 --> 00:31:21,619
pictures of the evidence and leave them
on your phone

320
00:31:21,619 --> 00:31:28,050
of you with all the stolen cash don't
buy Rolexes $40,000 role exists in

321
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:35,379
forces because especially if your your
main persona identity in real life is a

322
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,030
Domino's Pizza employees

323
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:52,110
that's that's can attract attention by
itself up for this I the last couple of

324
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:56,840
them like the other guy's using the
email addresses when you get if you use

325
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,760
it and email address or something never
use again we've done with it if the

326
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:05,820
command control means if you are using
decontaminated that domain when he used

327
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,669
in all personal email address what they
should have done is got rid of that

328
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:13,670
domain in every used again for further
operations that have never been traced

329
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:21,510
back to them I had a lot of people could
have put in this talk and I didn't just

330
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:28,700
obvious things there was a guy who heard
of the fattening the news leaks candles

331
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:34,830
one of the guys who got busted for it
was doing all the guy he's broke it off

332
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:48,399
half the iCloud account from his house
his moms house and the guy in he

333
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:54,130
registered the iCloud account that he'd
used to fish people for the back from

334
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:59,160
the passwords to register like a support
at I klout.com reason I can remember

335
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:03,460
what it was he registered that account
with his personal iPad that he also

336
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:10,660
retrieved his own iconic out where was
it hard to find so yeah you don't from

337
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:17,610
home mean you got this don't do that
though is the same devices even if

338
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:22,780
you're behind europeans or whatever you
don't do that stuff you gotta keep all

339
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:29,020
your things and needs-based separate
from things and you know on line 27

340
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:37,060
adjusted so yeah other arab sex
practices things that could have helped

341
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:40,629
a lot of other people make sure you have
a plane right know what you're going in

342
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:45,820
for the same thing with a pen test you
know what's going in for have a plan for

343
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,889
how you gonna do it

344
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:52,730
have clear definable objectives ok if
you're thinking about doing something

345
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,970
that doesn't help you achieve that
objective like tweet about it or talk to

346
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:02,850
somebody about it or take a risk that
does not get you to order objective

347
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:13,569
don't do it real simple also talked
about the decision they just don't do

348
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:20,520
that stuff that's the one that said
mister mister robot gets wrong and don't

349
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,790
use devices that use your daily
activities

350
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:27,980
probably get rid of them when you're
done with them be paranoid beforehand it

351
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,449
apparently after

352
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:35,649
ok better be paranoid when you're doing
something then be paranoid afterwards

353
00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:38,139
when you're wondering if your gonna get
caught because you did something stupid

354
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:42,589
also good offset takes a lot of time
it's something you have to build into

355
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:48,120
your routines it's gonna take you longer
because of upset but also a lot of

356
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:53,199
trouble later on and the other thing is
of course Dansko ok don't if you're

357
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,199
doing a pending or whatever you're doing

358
00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:02,470
don't go outside the scope don't get
emotional ok a lot of the guys here like

359
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:06,310
the guy who have to increase in maryland
you got emotional about it and he went

360
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:12,299
outside US go they go on Instagram he
got emotional about it you have to think

361
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:22,820
about it objectively ok other resources
for OPSEC is the grow up I took a lot of

362
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:27,790
material from this doesn't stop him from
watching as stocks as a really good one

363
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:35,210
called OPSEC because jill is for WF TPD
and I actually got permission to cite

364
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:41,590
stuff in the stock so it's fine but is
this guy's a really good resource if you

365
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,360
ever watch this

366
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:47,800
already you should even if you're not
doing anything illegal but when you're

367
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:52,280
in the great it's good to know these
things especially when you get into like

368
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:56,850
bug disclosure and in your disclosing
vulnerable people people will not always

369
00:35:56,850 --> 00:36:09,600
be friendly and is good to a poor s good
to protect yourself and the star how to

370
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:14,770
do everything wrong this is a guy who
inspired the talk was not very readable

post from / are / gif you at speeds

373

there was a kid from Belgium hungering

374
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:37,490
website for older people he uses some
sort of like PHP shell script to get in

375
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:45,710
although userdata he finds out the other
people install back doors on the same

376
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:51,360
system right so you think's oh I'll just
let the Adhan the people that run this

377
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,360
website know without did so they can fix
it

378

381
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:21,640
action against you and then also accused
him of basically defacing the website

382
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:26,750
which you didn't do what you think is it
this way if there was other back towards

383
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:30,220
already on the system and the people
defacing websites right now the only

384
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:34,160
lead that have a US phone died so
they're gonna not just pin blame for

385
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:39,160
what you did but everything else he did
