1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
mistaken and that is like another
conference going on right now that deals

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:16,029
with plumbing hello there good ok
actually today's talk is under its own

3
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:26,450
as we've mentioned in the intro
interests are weird I'm Evan been awhile

4
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:31,810
since I've been here every gun excellent

5
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,489
yeah you know we haven't talked in
awhile so I thought maybe you'd like to

6
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:41,160
just get together and discuss a few
things and talk about everything

7
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:56,769
specifically that can kill you they do
title slide up the line at all this week

8
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,140
so it's going to be fun

9
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:05,449
my name is Kevin Boothe I'm Evan booth
on Twitter I'm also on earth is a human

10
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:13,880
man I work for school is mentioned
something that I've been doing in my

11
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:20,060
talks in the beginning before I get sort
of the the main subject matter is a

12
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:24,450
little squid

13
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:58,120
blowing up my phone right now so

14
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:05,659
so this is gonna go along by the way I'm
sorry I'm not sorry it's gonna be should

15
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:10,789
I be doing this thing called the shotgun
of random and this is sort of ideas that

16
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:15,410
kind of come to me here and there and
some some ideas they bounce around for a

17
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:20,019
long time and leave and so really this
is just a service to myself I'm just I'm

18
00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:23,360
I'm forcing them on you in rapid
succession

19
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,519
succession so here we go

20
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,379
it's nice and I think it'd be an amazing
city somewhere like someone walking a

21
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:37,290
lot of dogs as you know you know
trucking along the way to someone I got

22
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,578
right behind them and then they would
turn a corner and then like like a

23
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:43,819
couple seconds later screaming then
re-emerged around the corner with just

24
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:48,298
look of twisted whore on their faith and
then in the other hand will be holding a

25
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:54,700
monthly issues with inflatable balloon
animals that's going to be a Japanese

26
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:02,599
game show and there's the shower head of
random alright so yeah I got glasses

27
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:08,328
exactly one week ago today so if I'm
like doing things like Will Ferrell and

28
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:14,980
movies 13 so yeah I'm still getting used
to this

29
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:21,560
like Bambi walking so yeah I excuse on
the plus side my wife said that my

30
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:30,290
glasses make me look less threatening
that isn't an exact quote less less

31
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:34,660
threatening us now that I've glasses I
can talk about the things you think

32
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,120
about the catch

33
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:48,470
you know the thing about hitting a man
with a battery in a sock and you just

34
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,739
are and then people cling on every word
they like I'm ready for my quiz with

35
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:54,420
cold water here we go

36
00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:03,328
it's unwise of me to share these details
but I've become inebriated somebody make

37
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:06,329
an observation about this photo what's
going on

38
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:29,909
about this jump it is it slanted why is
that concrete slanted you guys don't

39
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,620
know this is awesome I'm so glad I got
to tell you this

40
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:38,389
ok so this is so I am I am in a car
moving rates taking this photo safely

41
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:42,410
out of the window and and what you're
seeing here as a result of what's called

42
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:46,560
a rolling shutter right a lot of CMOS
sensors they use this and usually in

43
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,900
like lower in digital cameras lot of
phones and stuff like that and instead

44
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,289
of say they will be exposing tire sensor
to the seen the light bright but instead

45
00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:57,690
of reading data from the whole thing the
whole image like India so far my

46
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:02,419
favorite line by line right and they do
that because it decreases bottlenecks

47
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:05,590
indebted better for battery life it
helps you take pictures faster

48
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:11,440
succession but that does mean that by
the time you finish taking a photo in

49
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,550
collecting all the lines of from the
sensor change the different specially if

50
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,880
you're moving or something that you're
shooting is moving quickly right so it

51
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,039
works like this

52
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,190
like online already like this that's a
rolling shutter basically you're

53
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:29,340
capturing a period of prime very quickly
but you can see that in these photos

54
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:36,940
videos as well obviously really cool
stuff so the shock and a random aspect

55
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:41,270
of this is that I wish someone I wish I
wouldn't but I also wish that I had a

56
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,830
lot more time would come when ready
software that would take a dip in

57
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:53,349
consumer photo like this and look at the
exit sensor type ratio is your location

58
00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:59,080
or less stuff i zoom level and that with
the characteristics about that rolling

59
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,770
shutter that they know about or fixed
and then maybe throw some neural network

60
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:08,349
on top of that maybe over time have a
have a computer be able to say you know

61
00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:12,539
this looks like a rolling shutter
distortion here and an end to all the

62
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,620
math basically it so you could take a
photo like this and looking at this

63
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,620
particular section you know that this is
supposed to be

64
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:25,040
perpendicular and this these countries
last but we know that the the distance

65
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:30,290
or represented between these two lines
measure of time right because we need is

66
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:34,410
a rolling shutter you know captured all
that you know like that so that's that's

67
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:38,950
a known amount of time based on the
shutter speed and the characteristics of

68
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:44,500
the rolling shutter so we also know that
we have a degree of skew right and so

69
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:50,400
with information like you're able to
eventually looking in it that in the

70
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,890
subjects in the photo really start to
pull out information about how fast the

71
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:58,530
camera was moving at that point I'm
right what is the bearing where's it

72
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:06,580
going what are the winning lotto numbers
that's a that's a bold face lie but also

73
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:10,210
the stuff in the photo right because you
know parallax the thing obviously like

74
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:13,200
him two things that are further we're
going to be moving slower and your

75
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,409
viewfinder going to be less affected by
the rolling shutter so if you are a

76
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:20,940
measure that relatives something else
you can start mapping out where things

77
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,669
are relative in 3d space right now
faster than moving moving at all

78
00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:29,630
whatever in like i rly centers have been
used for a long long time so that a lot

79
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:33,580
lot of pictures and video and online so
that we could probably run through

80
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,880
Sinatra and get some really interesting
additional information

81
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,880
someone should do that

82
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:51,150
so these particles are thing and
companies are using these two home

83
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,109
automation

84
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:58,580
lots of competition is is growing and
growing and eventually this hardware

85
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:03,440
will become inexpensive enough such that
new construction will start to pull it

86
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,740
in because it makes sense right

87
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:10,820
most people will happen eventually one
of you jokers are going to find a really

88
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:16,440
nasty vulnerability like you know or see
you in like the low-level libraries that

89
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,260
one of these things uses and you'll find
yourself one evening be like oh I can

90
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:27,450
control all the stuff and a lot of
people's houses right so lighting you

91
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:33,240
know AV your HVAC door locks all this
stuff could potentially be reopened so

92
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:40,640
if one of you right and you in this
happens make the right choice and pick a

93
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,640
random night and then do this

94
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:24,490
completely and utterly screwed by the
lack of inflection available in

95
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:33,339
text-based communications a lot of
people so there are two ways to show

96
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:38,899
emphasis and texts you could italicize
you can make things bold discolored and

97
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:42,540
things out underline it do all the
things like this stuff's been around

98
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,420
offered you know a long long time right
and so lightly over time as we did more

99
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,479
and more communicating over this medium
we started to like improvised rate so

100
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,980
like we're doing this and this is
interesting to me this is we may have

101
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:02,610
heard stuff right we found a q-tip in a
tube sock right and you're like a look

102
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:11,060
now I'm just look now everyone knows I'm
really sketched out right now I'm

103
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,079
looking at you

104
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,760
disapprovingly because of you know this
character in Unicode and people started

105
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,760
adopting this

106
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:28,370
NEA gets really crazy you know jumper
cables and then you'd like to come home

107
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:39,160
and we've done this for a long time it's
okay and then like this happened

108
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:50,750
yeah that's hard to look at so there are
some some lesser-known conventions as

109
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:56,050
well you know read it has the the nested
superscripts yeah and you know be has

110
00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:02,760
green text right so this is this is all
good we don't have a pretty decent job

111
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,860
with all the stuff but consider this
like 10 in the first commercially

112
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,500
available

113
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,500
typewriter was introduced in the morning
and I

114
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:20,910
1873 and if you do some math that's a
hundred and forty-three years right now

115
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:25,790
that's typewriters right so so if you
just look at it like more digital and

116
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:30,560
you know real-time communication that's
you know i text based that's still likes

117
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,500
what fifty years right and in 50 years
or a hundred and forty-three years

118
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,630
however you're measuring if I want to
make darn sure that the person I'm

119
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,630
talking to knows I'm being sarcastic
what do I do

120
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:54,770
great job everybody we've done a great
job so I think that if someone said even

121
00:11:54,770 --> 00:12:00,710
a poor attempt to solving this problem
like I think we blended a better place

122
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:04,540
right our phones are devices like most
instructors now they know how we're

123
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,829
feeling right to some degree in not only
improve over time

124
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,980
like if I run over in like 10 flights of
steps I'm texting someone like I want

125
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:18,030
them to know that right I'm sorry I'm
gonna misspelling everything but like I

126
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:23,890
think I think it's an interesting space
on somebody needs to make a little

127
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:28,199
packet like little stickers of various
sizes and stuff and maybe maybe like

128
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,610
someone like some chrome around it and
then maybe some motion activated so I

129
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,610
can run around snickering placing them
on things that are not

130
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:59,000
I would start the movie and television
logic dictates that if someone like

131
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,240
shoot the deejay deejay runs off the
music stops as if they are wearing some

132
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,930
kind of like jet ski freakin treadmill
wrist strap thing that is not how that

133
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:13,609
works guys music he's going you're stuck
with whatever it is okay so this one is

134
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:17,670
this next one is great if you if you
want to make a lot of money but you hate

135
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:24,029
everything and everyone needs to make a
pair of like really unique pants and if

136
00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:28,670
anyone knows these pants is just an
example rape so when you make a pair of

137
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:31,560
pants it's like you need for every
single pair sold of course they be like

138
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,449
five ten thousand dollars right but on
top of that you can purchase these pants

139
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:41,890
and less you take this extensive
physical assessment and you are ranked

140
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:49,319
in the 98 99 percentile of attractive
right there hot pants tell your friends

141
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:55,000
so right so you got this not only that
you would have to come back and be

142
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,400
re-evaluated every 12 months or
something like that

143
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,910
be like men suffer rapid jackasses

144
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:07,599
and you would have to sign a contract to
this effect and buried somewhere deep

145
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:13,410
within the contract would say look you
know those sketchy and like sell or give

146
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:25,410
away your pants will burn your house
down to your friends and stuff like

147
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:30,709
sporting events conferences all that I
someone is a little box on the belly of

148
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:36,489
a little trap door and opens like
randomly and just dropped out glasses to

149
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:47,800
help people deal with things better be
seen a secret service agent doing this

150
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,910
you might think that he's like listening
as your your PC no to someone else away

151
00:14:51,910 --> 00:15:11,118
but actually this is whatsapp yeah
machines express inequality

152
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:19,310
Uruguay's that humans express inequality

153
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:39,769
grandeur point except to say this movie
might have been the good guy I'm just

154
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:49,350
saying that out there because the
Doppler effect right why is someone

155
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:53,480
invented a speaker wright the tracks the
car and trucks the velocity in the

156
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:59,170
trajectory know that self and in like
sends a message but a Justin just the

157
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:03,479
the pitch and volume based on where they
are so it comes through in their car is

158
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:12,629
like one like continuous steady audio
signal right leg and then the driver

159
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:15,629
poops

160
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:39,449
like that one thing it's always really
fascinated me was the fact that

161
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,600
throughout history

162
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:46,770
some some things products or whatever
the case may be some of them like really

163
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:53,199
find really like a lot of using a very
wide variety of markets and applications

164
00:16:53,200 --> 00:17:00,160
right and this could be a completely
natural product or something that we

165
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,890
make whatever any good health for a
number of reasons and I think really

166
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:11,680
boils down to this like like some things
we like a race species we've really ask

167
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,850
the question of what's the full
potential of this thing and that's

168
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:20,169
something they like just like I excited
even saying it right that's a really

169
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,950
interesting question to me and like
we've asked that about some things over

170
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:23,550
time

171
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:28,069
know a lot of a lot of the above the
times when we do ask that question there

172
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:32,929
are no financial motivations and its
limitations invitation to do so so I

173
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:40,570
transistors on a way for silicon right
you know how can we organize plastic to

174
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:46,080
make it the most structurally sound
right now the most interesting examples

175
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:52,129
for me or the ones that that have either
or motivations it is rooted in passion

176
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:57,240
or or necessity right and two that come
to mind of course the first being Mr

177
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,240
George Washington Carver and

178
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:09,879
so I i was thinkin about drug testing it
was certainly doing a little research

179
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,140
stuff like you know what I have like the
third grade book report

180
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,380
George Washington Carver in my head like
that's pretty much it so it's like a

181
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:21,370
bullet points that are OK for third
graders and like you don't want that

182
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:24,219
kind of captures the general idea is
that it's really interesting to go back

183
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:28,710
through and look at it was like a more
adult perspective and stuff see

184
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,029
different things

185
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:36,640
appreciate but anyways how we all know
George Washington Carver didn't work on

186
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:42,470
peanuts right he really looked at it
appeared in like this tiny little thing

187
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:47,570
and you know he had great success with
that also maybe a little known fact

188
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:54,970
george washington carver he when he got
to a new University to assume a teaching

189
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:59,220
role realized it had no lab equipment
whatsoever that joke he went to a

190
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:04,270
junkyard in just found stuff made what
he's like to make a lab right but that's

191
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:07,720
that's like this that's who he was as a
person you've really had a passion for

192
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,970
education teaching like a lot of them
like this really shoot two primary

193
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:17,980
drivers but I'm behind how he
accomplished so much in his lifetime you

194
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:25,480
would think he lived in a five hundred
years but he really loved nature like

195
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,340
you know sort of painting it and all the
stuff and it was just fascinated with

196
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:35,270
the other thing is he really had a
passion for one source for farmers he

197
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:41,250
wanted to help them help to help them
understand how do I know how to maximize

198
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:46,100
what I can do with what I have you know
full potential things so he made a

199
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:52,610
couple of things with peanuts in it

200
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:15,340
that's my favorites so you spent after
he made peanut pants it's just the list

201
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:19,780
on s question maybe I was like maybe I
was typing a shopping list

202
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:28,340
rash cream we actually may have made
that that's yeah I saw that I give me

203
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:37,500
some of that that peanut flavor
nitroglycerine please you know maybe I

204
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:43,650
will think so yes so fantastic
individual like the dude is brilliant

205
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:48,430
and a great example of what can happen
when someone asked the question what is

206
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:57,670
the next example comes from from cuba
and eisenhower they impose a trade

207
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:04,410
embargo on Cuba in 1960 and then in
ninety-one I think 88 percent of their

208
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:09,430
oil imports dried up in like the economy
just got kicked in the face right and so

209
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:14,010
all the sudden we can't buy things you
know it's it's it's more or less illegal

210
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:22,110
to own like you know deviate from what
everyone else has right and like I'm in

211
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:26,280
the AM five categories president goes so
citation needed there that's my

212
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:32,590
understanding but what I do know is that
because of that particular set of

213
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:40,040
constraints the whole country basically
had to be very very creative about what

214
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:46,170
they have using it to accomplish you
know get basic life stuff right and of

215
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:49,390
course you know castro spawned this
whole thing is the special period in

216
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:54,040
time of peace which is the only the most
hand wave each sentence I've ever read

217
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:59,030
in my life but I need some amazing stuff
like this is how it

218
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:03,280
work so they would take a bike like a
freakin Frankenstein monster bike struck

219
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:08,540
by a motor on it and coloring and like
cruise around in that thing that's

220
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:26,570
amazing it is a two liter bottle ride
fast my friends this thing this thing

221
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:37,669
recharges hearing aid batteries and also
kills you surprised Hayes yeah I don't

222
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:42,030
have to hear anymore you know they could
recharge your batteries are likable what

223
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:48,889
we will do this great idea steve is
working now

224
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:54,830
thing on the left is a flywheel powered
motor starter basically drop away its

225
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:59,800
then wheel spinning I used that to start
start engine starter spell right can add

226
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:04,960
that gravity doesn't feel very off and
on the right there's a home-brewed

227
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,960
irrigation system with you know bottles
and BBC in

228
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:56,240
ok ok ok Trace laser government-issued
food trays rise hello hello hello hello

229
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:07,039
hello hello hello good and I sound the
same to me like a muscled nothing really

230
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:13,350
I think it's easier to trace people use
them as in tennis right absolutely

231
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:16,689
amazing in this the skyline is littered
with these things because like that's

232
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:20,419
that's that's what one does it like it
is really kind of created a whole whole

233
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:25,740
industry for people who can you know
jerry rigged the stuff they have and the

234
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:30,330
government sort of like again he got in
on this and they put in a publication

235
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:34,149
called The Book for the family and it
was basically kind of a compilation of

236
00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:37,739
like Popular Mechanics and how do you
guys up like that and how to use the

237
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:41,870
stuff you had to make things happen
right because they were trying to make

238
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:44,039
it a good thing

239
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:47,820
likely parents do for toddlers you know
like I know you want to do this let's

240
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,980
make a game out of it right

241
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:56,720
yeah I don't really know that's very
accurate in like this follow they

242
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:07,370
followed it up with this dot com dot org
done business with this and I think that

243
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:11,979
this is a 300 page manual just jam
packed full of like anarchist cookbook

244
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:19,980
recipes right so there's a trend has
transformed thank you this is a pattern

245
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,659
for force intended all with an
unsettling amount of attention paid to

246
00:25:23,659 --> 00:25:26,659
the nipple area

247
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:33,009
I seriously like look at this for about
five minutes in like why would anyone

248
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:39,129
need to do this and then I realized that
I probably need to learn learn to speak

249
00:25:39,129 --> 00:25:46,559
Spanish but is it really was an
underwear guide that makes a lot more

250
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,559
sense

251
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:15,009
this appears to be plans to build a very
rudimentary kill yourself device

252
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:28,749
nonstick I don't know I would imagine
this is before citing early zeroing or

253
00:26:28,749 --> 00:26:32,289
something but like them like they're
your electrical needs right here in like

254
00:26:32,289 --> 00:26:37,049
this does the thing and I i dont even
know ma'am my favorite though is

255
00:26:37,049 --> 00:26:45,649
probably probably the the plasmid
isadora whereby you take settled Italian

256
00:26:45,649 --> 00:26:50,998
dressing don't shake it and then you
take a needle in and put it over here in

257
00:26:50,999 --> 00:26:55,869
these two jars with ghosts in them or
something and then you of course you're

258
00:26:55,869 --> 00:27:00,459
on that line over to the motor from a
refrigerator and then plug it into the

259
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,200
wall

260
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:10,440
the plasmid isadora of course some
people are making do with what they have

261
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:17,440
one of the one of the standout items
that you always find is the rico washer

262
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,999
/ dryer and this is the sort of them
became more and more the Arica washer

263
00:27:22,999 --> 00:27:26,570
because the driver would always crap out
something else that fascinates me about

264
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:34,119
electronics specifically is like it's
not just the boxes great example

265
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:39,860
fantastic I you know it's it's not just
just an appliance or something it's a

266
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:44,740
bunch of crap inside that all has you
know various various life cycles right

267
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:48,379
to like you could have a lot of really
good stuff still left less than left in

268
00:27:48,379 --> 00:27:53,498
your your broken thing and they realize
this and so everything they would just

269
00:27:53,499 --> 00:27:54,720
cut it right down the middle

270
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,649
will keep the washer right the dryer
will we're going to use that motor

271
00:27:58,649 --> 00:28:02,889
everything else he became a thing in
this this actually made it into the by

272
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:08,840
our own efforts guide right how to use
your your your dryer motor for this one

273
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:14,709
shredded coconut right this is this is
an automated Keadle care crazy thing

274
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:23,139
this is the slanty thing I don't know
what I think I think it's doing like a

275
00:28:23,139 --> 00:28:24,370
boss

276
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:31,508
this is a shoe polisher the same motor
this is a boat propeller attached to the

277
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:36,460
motor still what looks like a brick but
it's a better but it's a fan right like

278
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,960
you know we've got the stuff some
functional stuff out of it with the

279
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:45,299
stuff we have I love it right so that's
the fastest means its people that had to

280
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:48,899
either because of necessity or because
they were just passionate about it out

281
00:28:48,899 --> 00:28:58,029
really like talking to an item with this
thing so sort of with that without that

282
00:28:58,029 --> 00:29:15,850
passion mixed with its is the fan better
with the fam so the so I said I wasn't

283
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:19,418
bad so I started thinking about this and
also thinking about the fact that like

284
00:29:19,419 --> 00:29:23,950
we're becoming more more independent on
on things that are powered electricity

285
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:28,269
and not becoming more more familiar with
how electricity works on a fundamental

286
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:32,440
level that's that's problematic so I
started exploring the notion of like

287
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:38,519
okay so if if we don't have power and
that's not like a less like a call to

288
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:42,139
arms for preppers or 10 simple had books
like that I'm just thinking through this

289
00:29:42,139 --> 00:29:46,610
right and it's going to happen tomorrow
or anything like that but it's a fun

290
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:49,769
probably think through just from this
perspective right so I started thinking

291
00:29:49,769 --> 00:29:55,909
feeling ok what it was like the the base
basic number of concepts that the

292
00:29:55,909 --> 00:29:59,509
average person would have to know to get
things done privately with electricity

293
00:29:59,509 --> 00:30:05,000
so sort of exploring that sort of
working on a project called practical

294
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,629
post-apocalyptic electronics and so one
of one of the the the practical

295
00:30:11,629 --> 00:30:18,230
exercises and this was the shack and
this is a a six by 11 foot shack in

296
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:22,269
Kentucky and I went to stay there for a
week and it doesn't have electricity

297
00:30:22,269 --> 00:30:24,150
electricidad

298
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:29,220
and I took with a bunch of stuff that
you might find in a typical American

299
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,230
house right

300
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:35,650
had a coffee maker you know a couple of
the yard tools and other stuff like that

301
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:41,010
just regular old stuff spent a week
taking it apart and and like starting to

302
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:46,030
retrofit this shack with things that are
that are kind of the cities right so

303
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:49,840
this is actually my initial approach to
the shack my grandfather built this for

304
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,010
me when I was like 10 so it's been a
long time since I've been in it

305
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:08,610
open

306
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:41,639
days cleaning up the whole inside like
Dexter's kill room and I took like 37

307
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:44,658
puddles of that spray foam and like
literally made the whole thing about

308
00:31:44,659 --> 00:31:54,779
like it could have flooded outside so
they're working on lighting a full

309
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:58,659
bottle of water which exit to diffuse
the light source next to it took a

310
00:31:58,659 --> 00:32:06,399
little tchotchkes LED flashlight cop the
lighting lol to it with no soldering

311
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,860
tools harder than it sounds I used a
blowtorch for a lot of stuff

312
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:17,070
ended up taking basically taking a nail
between two pieces of bark bark acting

313
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:25,010
as an insulator suppliers which heat
that up to his blue eyes and says it was

314
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:29,120
it was blew it out then I'd take that
you know my work in the side of a very

315
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:34,279
slow slow process but interesting and
can be done certainly but ended up with

316
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:39,510
some interesting lights in my little by
little shack posing as far as power goes

317
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:49,639
I had a 12 volt ATV marine battery is
also using turns out the process of

318
00:32:49,639 --> 00:32:54,408
experimentation and punish you run
roughly 19 volts does this one war that

319
00:32:54,409 --> 00:33:00,600
I had it backwards it puts a fairly
steady 50 so that's that's a thing so I

320
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:07,709
can use these batteries you'd find in
drills and also a USB so I figured that

321
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:14,460
you know if this thing went sideways we
have a ton of those little USB battery

322
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:18,649
packs things so what did you use those
as well so that's actually just a

323
00:33:18,649 --> 00:33:25,010
cigarette lighter fine with that perform
a car and so I can you know I pulled

324
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:30,990
battery packs and then that would run
into this and this was sort of my my

325
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:33,990
main like control board for everything

326
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:47,590
prosper joining us doing more excited
this is my control barred came out more

327
00:33:47,590 --> 00:34:05,820
and more animated excited I think so
yeah I know why I used to use a variety

328
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:10,020
of stuff obviously there are much easier
ways to go about this these three things

329
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:14,380
here actually switches and they they do
various functions inside of the shack

330
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:20,700
and so like I used to relay from a thing
that out

331
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:26,609
relays are freakin amazing by the way
with electromagnetic relays so like if

332
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:35,750
your house and they see cuts on how do
you know right click the relay it gets

333
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,750
cold thank you

334
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:56,960
our car comes razor there he and
Rorschach remembered this so they had

335
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,450
these really are a lot of stuff anything
it clicks basically some of your like

336
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:09,220
big TVs have this actually very easily
find these things in your car you

337
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:14,189
probably have like 5 or 6 I'll just in
your car right that's the thing that a

338
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:17,999
relay basically allows you to have a low
power switch that turns your headlights

339
00:35:17,999 --> 00:35:24,319
and then directed by them or high
current line to your actual headlines

340
00:35:24,319 --> 00:35:30,089
right so I'm not going to help how
really is work but like you get into a

341
00:35:30,089 --> 00:35:32,880
basically it's like an if statement
right if I'm supplying power to the

342
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,039
relay its gonna connects you know this
this lead to that lead if not it's going

343
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:41,029
to connect this lead to that Lee right
so we think about that like you start

344
00:35:41,029 --> 00:35:45,200
building logic gates you can start
building anything right you can start

345
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:54,279
building CPUs this is how it started
right but much smaller this is an

346
00:35:54,279 --> 00:36:00,249
example of a switch its kind of gangster
you you close the lot near the last on

347
00:36:00,249 --> 00:36:04,859
the lock and it connects this is yet to
turn the key to turn off the kind of fun

348
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:23,169
yea pulled up all the lead switch out of
the south and take that up to the door

349
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:27,530
and that allows me to be able to
automatically turn on when I enter

350
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:58,289
little status LED how important is my
door I know because I know because bugs

351
00:36:58,289 --> 00:37:11,460
and Kentucky man so I wanted a long as
well and of course I you know never be

352
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:16,480
too careful and I wanted to build what's
called a latching relay basically once

353
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,480
you you you put power this thing when
you take power off it doesn't flip back

354
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,609
right

355
00:37:22,609 --> 00:37:28,470
sticks there are some very simple ways
to build this I i went nutso some rather

356
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:34,680
intentionally for the fun of it so I
took a head unit out of my car and I

357
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:41,470
replaced it not too long before that and
I use the little CD ejector new motor

358
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:45,959
assembly thing little gear assembly took
that out all the stuff in your in your

359
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:53,059
car typically runs on 12 volts which is
nice because it plays well with it was a

360
00:37:53,059 --> 00:38:01,309
video I so that was that was a latching
relay actually working so basically went

361
00:38:01,309 --> 00:38:07,220
well votes it's a little motor assembly
right this motor starts turning these

362
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:11,848
gears and is not starts pulling up the
straight line and once that slack it's

363
00:38:11,849 --> 00:38:13,260
taken to the tryline

364
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:20,740
little plastic tab out between these
what is this right and on either side of

365
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:26,500
that close family business in our two
leads which connects you know the the

366
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:32,150
the circuit here these 49 goals which
run down to the weasel it's mounted on

367
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:35,150
the wall

368
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:47,009
so who knows what happens when you run
off you know that much voltage really

369
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:56,099
quickly through a really thin wire it
access as a resistor right and starts

370
00:38:56,099 --> 00:39:00,210
eating up rapidly inserts shedding some
of that energy cannot possibly piped

371
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:05,700
through its tiny little body so that's
wrapped around the fuse for now if

372
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:09,038
someone opens the door and our our
little master lock eyes shut right that

373
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:13,530
that's circuit is closed that's going to
supply power to our Relay latching relay

374
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:16,819
assembly thing and then in this one

375
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:53,650
worse off in your home

376
00:39:53,650 --> 00:40:05,570
that's it just I can say that the police
but I really don't said iraq's it's a

377
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:09,990
good to me smells it smells fantastic
smells like it smells like you threat

378
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:12,990
like when I was a kid that smell it
comes right back

379
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:20,090
fantastic so right so I spent a week in
the shack having done that reflected I

380
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:26,070
am definitely a learning experience and
very beneficial that maybe the scope is

381
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:31,320
a little right so using anything doing
anything with it ever you know it's kind

382
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:49,170
of a little tough to digest all that
right so I kind of wanted to look at if

383
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:54,040
if what happened in cuba happened here
now what would be our washing machine

384
00:40:54,040 --> 00:41:04,960
right thing and so yeah it would be the
thing I don't disagree but I started

385
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,230
thinking about the Keurig coffee maker
right

386
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:18,600
specifically I had I take it apart not
too long ago that I don't know what that

387
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,210
was

388
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:28,210
amazing but a really good stuff in these
things right and so I sort of -ism

389
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:34,790
statistics in the middle of last year I
think they put hearings having been in

390
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:38,820
nearly one in every three homes
something is still happening

391
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:52,830
gonna go back man that was forward I so
anyways I'm gonna stand here so yea

392
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:55,940
certainly the curing that they're
everywhere right and these things they

393
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:59,890
do have their mechanical problems like
anything does and so what what you'll

394
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:05,200
have is is this device that side of it
but a lot of them will you know get

395
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:11,580
turned over to replace it with new cell
sites are looking at that what was the

396
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:16,839
full potential of accurate and so I
started buying them on Craigslist and

397
00:42:16,839 --> 00:42:25,540
other places and tearing down just sort
of figured that was why so this is this

398
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:32,339
is tearing down a brand-new carrying
taking my time in being careful takes

399
00:42:32,339 --> 00:42:40,520
about two hours I spent a lot of make
sure you take time to play drums on the

400
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,520
curing the box

401
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:16,520
you know couple hours later you got
everything nicely disassembled I'm not

402
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,880
breaking anything intentionally and what
you'll find in most curious and like the

403
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:25,350
actual party insider changed over the
years and over various models but things

404
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:29,420
that you can pretty much guarantee
you're going to be in there are things

405
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:36,040
like LCD assembly which for me and in my
purse is not terribly useful but you get

406
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:40,320
a lot of really nice components that are
typically through hole soldered onto the

407
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:46,840
board and usually nice they labeled nice
and repurposed those cables you'll find

408
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:52,080
some transformers these are a lot of
them will have discrete power management

409
00:43:52,080 --> 00:44:00,549
boards for taking in the 120 volts AC
and that's what it needs a boiler in it

410
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:05,040
various shapes and sizes will have
enough like rigid and flexible tubing

411
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:10,600
here to choke a donkey variety of
springs and and rods and screws and

412
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:17,140
metal parts of some sort of this one
particular one I think I pull out of one

413
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:23,549
of the few models this is a really
really nice piece of hardware right so

414
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:27,620
it's a stepper motor it has a built-in
electronic speed controller so you give

415
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:33,160
it a supply voltage and then you can
give it a month later you know 50 signal

416
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:37,490
to say how fast is going in another one
you pull the ground to say is the break

417
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:41,390
up late or not and then another one to
say well if this is above a certain

418
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:47,370
number of votes for it otherwise its
reverse its gotta get has a built-in

419
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:51,109
Hall effect sensor and so you know
exactly how much that motor is actually

420
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:55,320
turning as is doing his work which is
fantastic and like very well documented

421
00:44:55,320 --> 00:45:00,590
heart absolutely outstanding I was a
little disappointed to see in the newer

422
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:07,010
models they switched from the stepper
motor to like a much much less expensive

423
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:14,500
regular brushless Dec motor but they
still had this really nice nice assembly

424
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:19,119
thing which basically converse that
rotational motion into it

425
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:31,140
pushing to use this to pump water out of
the reservoir into the boiler finds this

426
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:38,240
is a 12 volt solenoid and a lot of other
stuff really gonna depending on which

427
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:43,799
one you're looking at but what you can
expect to see more or less

428
00:45:43,799 --> 00:45:49,220
some of the new ones a deal anymore it's
really cool to watch how how the design

429
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:54,379
his evolved over time it is using less
and less parts less and less complexity

430
00:45:54,380 --> 00:46:02,119
and appreciation for engineering or
manufacturing takes the fun part right

431
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:06,769
and like the process of doing that you
have to think through how how someone

432
00:46:06,769 --> 00:46:12,740
expected for someone to put this thing
together really interesting but I want

433
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:20,149
to learn about the basic operation
looking at this control board and the

434
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:27,230
boiler for us and here's a solenoid down
there in like water gets piped in from

435
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:34,589
here because it's all witchcraft I'll
even know it doesn't even matter it

436
00:46:34,589 --> 00:46:37,859
wasn't trying to build another coffee
maker

437
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:44,890
other stuff right so if you think about
all of that stuff all these components

438
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:49,710
and you try to solve the problem of
what's what's the full potential of this

439
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:52,970
thing what can you do with it you know
the answer very quickly becomes well

440
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:55,970
pretty much everything right

441
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:08,770
yeah that's a really good question was
you know as the design progressed did

442
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:15,900
the components get cheaper you know they
they probably did but in an intelligent

443
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:22,850
way so they try to get a good example of
this right so I okay so you know who has

444
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:32,660
a hearing in here so once the water in
the reservoir dropped it in water BC are

445
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:41,069
right that works so basically in the
reservoir is a little Lodi right and it

446
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:45,490
floats with the water level and once it
gets below a certain point a reader on

447
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:50,520
either side either magnetic or some of
the newer ones actually have like the

448
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:59,400
flu thing is a half circle reflector
rain and reflects an infrared light back

449
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:05,530
and says okay well you know you were
here the newer ones they they removed

450
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:09,820
all of the moving parts and they
basically just have alongside the the

451
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:18,870
reservoir a thing that funnels up and
yes please and they they read the water

452
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:25,790
level at various points right so they
just have for everybody

453
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:35,320
so yeah so in that case they probably
saved a lot of money in manufacturing

454
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:39,680
and natural parts themselves but they
are a really intelligent smart solution

455
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:45,140
is just like your engineering and yes
that's fantastic question so when you

456
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:50,560
think about potential like go either way
so you have like what are some positive

457
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,650
things I can do with this thing

458
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:57,450
negative things you can do I start
looking at the negative things first so

459
00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:04,580
I want to do is set up a bit of a test
rig and scan to play around with some

460
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:11,279
pneumatics I want to be able to transfer
would you like a reservoir on a

461
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:23,380
different color but do it you know with
my current setup the boots gauge there

462
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:32,930
is from a car and you probably imagining
what I want to do with that and just a

463
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:40,190
quick aside a show of hands how many
people assume that boiler like this and

464
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:43,440
a product like this when a boiler is
Boing Boing

465
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,440
the water that is under pressure

466
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:51,570
reasonable sometimes I thought that
going in actually know like what when

467
00:49:51,570 --> 00:50:00,300
the water goes into the atmosphere so
like there's no risk of overloading the

468
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:04,920
boiler not to mention that the weather
itself as a thermal cutoff like directly

469
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,630
on it as other thermostat right out
right there on it

470
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:11,690
in addition to a thermistor which is
feeding back into the air the board

471
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:17,250
actually really relatively safe from a
physical standpoint quite safe from

472
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:24,390
people taking them apart in building fun
things I wanted to do a test ride

473
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:27,180
transferred basically transferred water

474
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:30,180
from one to another

475
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:40,630
you might call this reloading first
video ever made a sound for second

476
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:48,230
amazing alright so and this one i
basically flipped flopped on the

477
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:56,550
solenoids on and supply current to the
boiler and you can see here as that

478
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:59,309
water can fix this team and this thing

479
00:50:59,309 --> 00:51:13,619
pressure is steadily increasing to a
certain point and sent to

480
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:31,490
too well here at this point you have the
ability to release a lot of pressure and

481
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:37,549
inside of you know one direction no
controlled out like what do you have

482
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:44,280
basically right well I was gonna I was
gonna say I was gonna say fight firearm

483
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:52,920
but you know I guess I started thinking
about that and then switch gears here in

484
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:56,830
the middle because I found it a
two-year-old at home I found the only

485
00:51:56,830 --> 00:52:00,120
time I could work on this is literally
the middle of the night right now I'm in

486
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:05,250
the garage and I like I'm not sure if I
want to blow this thing up in the moment

487
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:08,890
it's a bad scene right and also you know
I thought that it was the low-hanging

488
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:14,220
fruit so far nicer looking at the
positive things you can do this stuff

489
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:19,069
and I wanted to I want to pick a project
that sort of showcase the various

490
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:22,590
components and what you can do with all
that stuff and I wanted it to be

491
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:28,500
ambitious right so so this is something
I'm working on now and I want to show

492
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:32,070
you the progress in kind of the steps
leading up to it this evening but

493
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:41,130
building a mechanical prosthetic so this
particular one you probably paid ninety

494
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:45,660
two hundred grand for right things are
are terribly expensive and the reason i

495
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:49,100
picked this is because there are other
people actively working on solving this

496
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:54,049
problem but doing it like you know ways
right so like 3d printed prosthetics is

497
00:52:54,050 --> 00:53:02,320
a substantial things like a viable
option if you need to have a process and

498
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:07,380
so what I did was basically what all of
you should do if you start working on

499
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:11,350
projects and you're unsure of the
direction to go in you start making some

500
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:15,630
garbage prototypes right so this is the
first one and I just wanted to kind of

501
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:20,430
test you know some of the mechanical
bits of its authority had a really the

502
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:24,480
mechanic mechanical part of this is sort
of the only tough problem to solve

503
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,810
completely but not the only one but it
is definitely

504
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:32,700
you know far away the hardest right
because you want to have a fairly good

505
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:36,700
control of this thing you want to get a
grip something right within a reasonable

506
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:42,069
amount of strength and in do that with a
very simple like linear motion with like

507
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:50,480
whether it's it's human powered by a lot
of them are or whether I don't know I

508
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:59,869
linear actuator like the ones inside of
a caring so certain tests and this is

509
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:04,690
very valuable for me because I about the
limitations of the materials I'm working

510
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:10,960
with how does this plastic holed up in
like these various bits be used

511
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:17,070
effectively in all this and so that's
that's sort of like that this is a man

512
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:21,130
when he first put this issue to get him
out of that prison in the cave whatever

513
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:24,130
she look in retrospect

514
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:35,250
so early on so then I moved to do just
testing the digits secular mechanism for

515
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:44,280
those freaky like worms sort of thing
I'm using a piece of rubber from the to

516
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:48,210
being cut open and then tacking that
along the various joints right is

517
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:52,900
applying a force on on the the site
opposite what caused it to construct and

518
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:58,109
then the elastic would return it to its
original position so I found that there

519
00:54:58,109 --> 00:55:04,250
was there wasn't enough horizontal
stability with that particular model so

520
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:13,339
I tried another one same basic concept
using using two lines instead and so

521
00:55:13,339 --> 00:55:22,130
making progress right you know it's a
from here this was I guess about

522
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:30,530
CEO feel like I'm in a good place us
we're gonna do so I started recording

523
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:43,260
from the very start and this is actually
this is gonna be twenty 20 hours of

524
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:46,260
hands-on work

525
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:44,010
right now

526
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:50,890
so so I'm forming metal rods that were
used to detect those cans and joints of

527
00:59:50,890 --> 01:00:00,900
the fingers and I was a great suggestion
what I doing here and yeah so you know I

528
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:06,590
did a crap load of just filing away so
that when you when you do like an exact

529
01:00:06,590 --> 01:00:09,150
stuff like this where you don't quite
know how things should fit the other

530
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:12,590
will in the end of the day we tend to
leave more material than you need

531
01:00:12,590 --> 01:00:18,390
knowing the way later so a lot of that
going on right now trying to do things

532
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:29,930
right a lot of standing here i think im
just trimming down a little ride ever

533
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:38,050
I say remember this was this morning so

534
01:00:41,410 --> 01:00:44,410
and it may be

535
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:58,810
how it's made by one of the best shoes

536
01:00:58,810 --> 01:01:07,310
so we're just doing some assembly here
actually putting things together using

537
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:11,810
only like five minutes reading up on the
end

538
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:33,599
can you clarify and you clarify the
rephrase

539
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:46,220
I'm using using using wires from a
ribbon cables as my my my texts region

540
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:49,220
liars

541
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,880
alright so

542
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:57,690
think the music gave up

543
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:05,460
20 hours

544
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:14,709
not twenty hours a day so anytime I
would approach my setup is crazy like I

545
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:20,420
had a tripod mounted the ceiling
basically anytime I would start working

546
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:24,760
or modify anything on the desk I would
start recording myself the way to do

547
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:44,359
whatever I would just be hands on and on
time and we're getting close is it was

548
01:02:44,359 --> 01:02:54,700
she said yes

549
01:02:59,630 --> 01:03:12,230
and I can repeat that for the record so
yeah

550
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:17,430
believe it or not make this out of a
coffee maker takes a lot of time and a

551
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:31,279
little trial and error turns out in some
really awful Cat Cat music so the

552
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:44,270
projects I've really stretching now I
think I'm apparently you're not wrong I

553
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:51,030
i probably picked up five or six
hearings at all on Craigslist very much

554
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:54,610
so that was the only one that knew and
that one was there was a special atari

555
01:03:54,610 --> 01:04:02,470
at 400 you're looking you're looking at
a hundred bucks at the most their next

556
01:04:02,470 --> 01:04:03,779
next up for that

557
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:10,840
going to add a thumb for that guy he's
one probably take the same approach and

558
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:12,860
then you know just get a wired up to

559
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:21,170
well to sort of a musical about a
pivoting bars and Julie and that will

560
01:04:21,170 --> 01:04:27,150
provide a linear forced actually you
know those things right and so connected

561
01:04:27,150 --> 01:04:33,520
the other side of that various points
along along the adjustable essentially

562
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:38,530
connect that to linear

563
01:04:38,530 --> 01:04:47,230
so allow me to open to close at hand
electronically after that I'm planning

564
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:52,940
on using the other number of ways to do
this right so what I want to do is be

565
01:04:52,940 --> 01:05:00,240
able to open and close binary any step
along the way and that sort of stuff to

566
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:05,450
do in your system is you don't know with
this particular model with that last

567
01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:07,379
stepper motor in the report on the old

568
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:13,569
just using new ones you would know
exactly where you are in the rotation

569
01:05:13,569 --> 01:05:18,038
even know exactly how far you track your
fingers right so now I sort of have to

570
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:20,599
solve the problem different way I'm
planning on doing that

571
01:05:20,599 --> 01:05:29,940
few different ways but one of them is
using the color sensor that you're using

572
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:39,990
for DRM so we don't actually be useful
piece of hardware also the water level

573
01:05:39,990 --> 01:05:44,589
water level sensor and there are
actually a couple of magnetic sensors in

574
01:05:44,589 --> 01:05:50,339
the newer models to just make sure the
lid closed and all that stuff so I'm an

575
01:05:50,339 --> 01:05:59,220
analog signal some done so it's gonna
rain with this right now so we'll need

576
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:06,640
to take away so quick and we get here on
time how do we make the crappy by Mormon

577
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:11,480
guy verbal right if not for us and
things that we want to to repurpose it

578
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:17,099
for four other people who don't have the
stuff instead of sending the stuff the

579
01:06:17,099 --> 01:06:22,500
landfills or like getting directly
recycled like I don't know what it is

580
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:29,890
factoring level individual consumer
education is a fascinating thing for me

581
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:36,339
right I wish that products by Mike Iver
ability scale associated with it

582
01:06:36,339 --> 01:06:42,400
how easy is it for me to take this and
repurpose it or how well documented the

583
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:47,190
PCB all the stuff that's interesting
stuff that's a pretty big questions

584
01:06:57,630 --> 01:07:03,920
now that's that's a question for a mind
my last takeaway actually a little

585
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:08,309
back-up story I hope this comes across
the right way we'll see but will remind

586
01:07:08,309 --> 01:07:14,329
the 2006 I it's in the movie death
becomes her and it was the night before

587
01:07:14,329 --> 01:07:22,240
Halloween and I wanted to make a costume
for my completed it trone advertising at

588
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:27,729
the time of the next day so I wanted to
make a costume lol I've had this idea I

589
01:07:27,730 --> 01:07:33,440
wanted to trade outside using like a
bunch of fun but I had built this which

590
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:42,289
is the gaping hole cost him essentially
it's a lot of duct tape before iPads are

591
01:07:42,289 --> 01:07:51,230
no events found six right I had a travel
DVD player screen thing from a friend

592
01:07:51,230 --> 01:07:55,410
and Butthead video in and I had a
digital camera and the battery shot on

593
01:07:55,410 --> 01:08:03,240
it and actually think the center was
going back to Kabul this thing together

594
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:08,660
you know took a couple of hours and I
made that the gaping hole costume and it

595
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:12,470
was a thing you know where the party was
fun but fast forward two years later

596
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:20,738
2008 the internet on the front page from
his raids you times and i got some views

597
01:08:20,738 --> 01:08:33,049
about that and I flicker flicker in 2006
and I saw this cold the concept and like

598
01:08:33,049 --> 01:08:35,198
the whole new level right

599
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:42,000
made this amazing costume put some
behind it it wasn't like a white t-shirt

600
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,479
white sweatshirt and by the way that is
the only acceptable use case for a solid

601
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:51,870
white sweatshirt and blue wig thing

602
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:25,880
I think that would be really cool I
don't think it'll happen what I what I

603
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:31,190
think might happen I mean you know what
I think might happen it wouldn't happen

604
01:09:31,189 --> 01:09:36,779
on the component level so much as it
would like like the functional groups

605
01:09:36,779 --> 01:09:51,429
right so like an example might be the
yes so the question was trying to head

606
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:54,840
the diagram and helps you actually
understand how it works right and it's

607
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:58,620
like you I foresee that happening or
some kind of like collection of

608
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:04,849
knowledge that it's probably contributed
that would exist like for today so I

609
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:10,250
would say the same maybe for cases like
the the DVD ejection assembly thing

610
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:21,070
might integrate that into another
another piece of something like that so

611
01:10:21,070 --> 01:10:34,170
it was a good for 2011 the iPad is
around a NASA engineer named Mark made

612
01:10:34,170 --> 01:10:42,160
this costume hole and torso any
similarity here at all he's following

613
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:45,130
the white sweatshirt rule which is good

614
01:10:45,130 --> 01:10:51,470
a fantastic job and one year later he is
a company called digital downloads

615
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:58,140
making shirts are you put devices to
make really interesting costumes couple

616
01:10:58,140 --> 01:11:01,790
more years he's actually merged
companies with the guys you make those

617
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:10,710
more solid color and he's got amazing
masks and a whole one insurance and

618
01:11:10,710 --> 01:11:18,210
customers with the same the same
principles and so this is certainly not

619
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:22,800
taking any credit whatsoever for the
success of this definitely not

620
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,800
but I

621
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:35,120
I'm trying to put this delicately I
think I'm able to ask the question is a

622
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:42,120
pic if I didn't spend a couple of hours
one night in 2006 like this happen which

623
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:45,780
the answer that question doesn't matter

624
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:50,849
categorically but I am proud and happy
to be able to ask it right and so I'm

625
01:11:50,850 --> 01:11:55,890
very happy that's how I chose to spend
my time and even though like I don't

626
01:11:55,890 --> 01:11:59,130
think anyone care to the time or
whatever you know like I think that it

627
01:11:59,130 --> 01:12:05,690
probably did impact someone on a very
very substantial level right so my final

628
01:12:05,690 --> 01:12:09,519
takeover be this you don't have to
change the world to establish a

629
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:13,980
precedent right I can you do something
you don't have to have a billion views

630
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:20,290
on YouTube for its have mad right now or
in the future it doesn't have to be

631
01:12:20,290 --> 01:12:24,550
something that revolutionizes or
something that brings you a lot of

632
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:30,740
wealth or whatever right here you got
too much time on your hands project that

633
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:33,090
no one understands why you're doing it
right

634
01:12:33,090 --> 01:12:37,230
like that thing it doesn't have to
change the world rate it just has to be

635
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:42,169
done you just have to do it only
requirement if they do that do that

636
01:12:42,170 --> 01:12:45,670
thing I was a difference of anything
that never been done before and

637
01:12:45,670 --> 01:12:50,570
something that's been done is you doing
it right and if it's something that it's

638
01:12:50,570 --> 01:12:54,210
interesting and I would venture to say
that were probably a pretty interesting

639
01:12:54,210 --> 01:13:00,980
bunch I don't know like to me this is
just like we should be doing we should

640
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:08,709
be building I don't ever stop doing that
right and the reason for that is because

641
01:13:08,710 --> 01:13:11,710
everything can kill you

642
01:13:12,739 --> 01:13:16,428
and we're all gonna die pretty soon and
although I think most people probably

643
01:13:16,429 --> 01:13:22,690
assume that the number of people that
are influenced right or or inspired by

644
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:28,570
you by yourself at any given time is
hovering around zero not always the case

645
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:34,320
and you never know so don't freakin stop
building always build stuff right or I

646
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:38,369
want to die I want to die but I'm gonna
build a lot of crap before that

647
01:13:38,369 --> 01:13:41,699
unapologetically so that's the takeaway
thank you very much
