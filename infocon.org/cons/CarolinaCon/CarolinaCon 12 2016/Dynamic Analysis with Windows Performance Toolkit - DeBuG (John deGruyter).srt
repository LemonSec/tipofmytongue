1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,450
alright thanks Vic so I'll start off as
a sort of the story

2
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:14,489
sorry for the delays here well as as he
mentioned I'm from West Virginia and

3
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,529
something about myself my home state and
currently live in Northern Virginia

4
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:25,410
dc-area but with West Virginia one thing
you gotta admit about us is we're really

5
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:34,769
really well known I so back in 2007 I
was Amman Jordan Jordan and it was with

6
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:41,890
the previous company and I was doing a
security assessment and in Jordan and I

7
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,399
was coming down the elevator going going
to catch my right eye was at the hotel

8
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:50,640
and was coming down the elevator and
there is a lounge singer there and he

9
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,230
had a big beard in everything and he's
playing piano and he's playing tunes in

10
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:59,349
the lounge and I'm walking out walking
down the steps I get to the glass doors

11
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:04,879
and when I'm walking out I hear the song
right and if you're from West Virginia

12
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,060
you know what song I'm talking about
right and even if you're not you

13
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,760
probably know what song I'm talking
about so here I am in and in jordan and

14
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,670
I'm walking out now here I got my
backpack my gear I'm ready to go and I

15
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:25,520
hear almost had I was like did he just
you know Jordan really and walking out

16
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:34,149
here almost head with the blue jeans and
I was like that's my stage as mistakes I

17
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,000
go back in

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,259
he's playing the piano and I'm like
that's me that's why I'm from West

19
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:47,509
Virginia West Virginia and anyway he
thought I was a freak but as big said

20
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:53,540
that's where I'm from I saw an ad for
Carolina con back in 2005 I thought had

21
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:59,520
on security focus website and I thought
you know what the heck I'm kind of

22
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,729
getting into security stuff I was going
to school on the GI bill was working

23
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:07,270
part-time at a computer store has
learned its north

24
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:12,530
and I was like yeah this is cool too I
like to see you know if these guys gonna

25
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:17,069
tell me about it so I Drive all the way
down and it was great

26
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:21,619
like they're all kinds of talks that
we're just really inspiring I had all

27
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,370
these ideas and all these thoughts of
different stuff that I want to do the

28
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:31,959
stuff I wanted to go try and remember
I'll never forget something out Stroger

29
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:33,370
said to me on that

30
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:40,519
that first time I was there and actually
actually are afraid they're outside a

31
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:46,560
lot of things to me but for some but
I'll never forget this thing so is the

32
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,510
last day and awesome I can learn all
this stuff I got all these ideas you

33
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,940
know there's nothing like this in West
Virginia and he said

34
00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:02,769
start one will do you know take it back
with you so Carolina con i SAT up in

35
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:08,560
everyones in the first one it's it's
just an awesome conference all of coming

36
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,590
down here I just like to give a round of
applause to the staff and everyone who

37
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:27,260
puts it on it we can give them another
thanks and with the video issues and

38
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,578
stuff like I'd feel free to move up to
the front or the front-rower if we want

39
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:34,609
to make a little semi-circle here you
know so you can actually see it be great

40
00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:41,819
but I'll go ahead and get started about
me my name is John to greater my handles

41
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:48,920
debug a company called dessert tray and
some other folks R and capture the flag

42
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:55,910
here the last four years I was a drink
or veteran a Marine Corps veteran so I

43
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:01,668
got to start my technical career in
california deserts the laptop in one

44
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:06,829
hand in my m16 and the other Cisco
routers and switches and since then it's

45
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:11,030
been about two decades or a banana tech
field kind of working on various things

46
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:15,600
is also an adjunct professor at George
Washington University where

47
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:21,608
computer network defense and it was
basically we would do a key offensive

48
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:25,430
techniques and then we know that since
his students an understanding of it we

49
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:30,110
show how to defend against it and there
was a lot of fun so I wrote a course for

50
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:35,550
that and did that for three years so
talk this song is for system

51
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:40,800
administrators malware analyst reverse
engineers developers and people who like

52
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,660
to know what's going on under the hood
which includes myself in what I'm going

53
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:51,580
to be talking about is a tool right and
tools are nice but they can take away

54
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:57,479
from us know and how it works on the
inside but it's a tradeoff right you

55
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:01,490
can't you can't do everything from the
command line although you wish you could

56
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:08,520
so this is a graphical graphical toward
I'm going to present to you if it's

57
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:14,289
something worst worth dieting in having
your toolkit that's for you to decide

58
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:25,909
part 1 we're going to talk about Windows
Performance Toolkit mining tools that

59
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,030
produce in-depth performance profiles a
Windows operating system and

60
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:35,849
applications basically this is going to
detect what's going on three different

61
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:40,469
parts to it when you're going to specify
the different events that you're

62
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:44,690
interested in going to start a recorder
that listens in the background for those

63
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:51,949
events and its gonna log and event
information as it occurs so some things

64
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:58,440
to know is based on bTW which is event
tracing for Windows and we're going to

65
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:06,159
talk a little bit more about this later
and has anyone used expert it's

66
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:12,870
basically a graphical user interface for
expert you can do more with expert but

67
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,870
it's kind of a complicated interface but

68
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:23,508
so setting it up you set it up with
Windows SDK or the ATK is the software

69
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:29,020
development kit for the assessment
deployment kit I believe it's not on by

70
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:35,520
default so make sure you check the box
with that and there's two parts to it

71
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:44,530
there's recorder will look at and
there's also an analyzer and this is

72
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:48,580
just a screenshot of the recorder but
basically you select from various

73
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:53,080
pre-configured profiles that are going
to listen for different things on on

74
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:59,979
your system so here I have first level
triage which is the default in this old

75
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:05,680
record a bunch of stuff in it it's it's
it's a good good baseline but I also

76
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,949
selected on this I selected file i/o
activity and registry i/o activity so

77
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:14,830
it's going to record any rights to the
file system and its gonna record any

78
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:21,620
rights to the registry and this is it as
it's running I just had a screenshot as

79
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:26,729
well because in the upper right corner
it shows you a memory usage indicator so

80
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:32,430
here it's used in five percent of memory
which you know isn't a whole lot and

81
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:44,969
also there's a hiki control Windows CE
stop it so the videos again this is

82
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:48,319
going to be pretty hard to see but we're
gonna we're gonna try here

83
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:04,320
ok so basically I'm open up a recording
that's already been done and interfaces

84
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:09,310
a little bit busy but once you get used
to it it's it's pretty useful as well

85
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:14,820
unless there's different graphs that you
can use and on the right side there's

86
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:19,320
different tabs that you can use in
basically what you do is you pull the

87
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,320
different graphs into the tabs and you
can create new ones which gives you a

88
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:29,930
nice clean interface to work with and
here I'm just gonna grab the processes

89
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:35,159
graphs so it's a graph in an adjacent
table when I see say graph it's it's

90
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:40,559
basically like a timeline that goes
across the top and you can select

91
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,819
different processes that were running
and it'll highlight it will highlight

92
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,810
the area that that process was running
so here are selected notepad plus plus

93
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:56,209
and also select notepad here so during
this time of the shaded area that's when

94
00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:03,570
notepad was running so it's pretty cool
to get an idea of what processes look

95
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:07,210
like you can also do this with threads
and you can drill down into a lot of

96
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:13,110
detail you can also select whether or
not you want to see just the table or

97
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:23,000
just the graph for the table and the
graph so for example we're gonna look at

98
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,280
some file i/o so there's a particular
file on the system and I want to know

99
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:34,220
what wrote to that file so I'm adding a
different view this is a graph you it's

100
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:40,300
i'm looking at different file i/o by
process and in this example I know that

101
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,120
the file was written to buy notepad and
right here I'm going to take out some

102
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,770
columns I don't need to seize I'm just
kinda shrinking it up a little bit and

103
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:57,900
I'm going to go to the notepad process
and another cool thing you can do is you

104
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:02,810
can right-click and you can filter
through that process so order to

105
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:08,250
selection and now it just shows no bad
idea exceed and this is all the file i/o

106
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,250
happened

107
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:15,970
with notepad and you can see in the top
of the tower in a timeline of that

108
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,540
corresponds with

109
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:26,420
when that notepad process was running
click right and it shows that I did a

110
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:36,150
right and it gives you an indicator that
actual right was on the time on over

111
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:42,110
here to the filename so it shows hello W
died txt so I know what I wrote to and

112
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,850
it shows the size so it shows 12 bytes

113
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:50,440
so that's the length of hello world so I
wrote tells me I wrote that file with

114
00:10:50,440 --> 00:11:01,750
Notepad process so next I want to see
all the different rights to the system

115
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,400
everything that happened so I'm gonna go
to a different view and I'm going to

116
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,270
look at

117
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:18,430
file i/o based on the type of event
expand that down and click on write you

118
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:21,920
see highlighted at the top are all the
different rights that happened on the

119
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:29,150
system during the length of this trace
that I recorded and filter to selection

120
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:34,280
so I'm looking at just the rights none
of the other event types and it gives

121
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,689
you a lot of information in the table
again I'm gonna take out a few different

122
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:48,670
columns and then you can search is nice
so you can do it right click and find in

123
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:53,709
column so I'm going to look for that
particular file I'm going to search for

124
00:11:53,710 --> 00:12:02,440
hello W txt and when I find that I'm
going to i'm going to search sort it so

125
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,440
that all those rights to that particular
file are together

126
00:12:09,889 --> 00:12:15,230
and here I see notepad exe and where I
wrote to it with 12 bytes and it shows

127
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:22,309
me on the timeline where that is and
also below that notepad plus plus dot

128
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:28,019
exe and I see the size is 35 so what
happens and you see that the timeline

129
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:33,720
indicators further to the right so what
happened was open that file up and wrote

130
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,480
to it with a different process and I can
at all

131
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:49,209
shown here in the graph so there's
another circumstance what if there's a a

132
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:55,429
file and you don't know how it got there
I created what you can do is search for

133
00:12:55,429 --> 00:13:00,329
all that creates that happened during
that race so I'm just going to do this

134
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:05,449
election and I look at everything that
was created during that race again I'm

135
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:11,349
going to search going to search for a
file called howdy image

136
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,930
now this shows me that file that I was
looking for work as I want to know what

137
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:31,479
process created it and if I scroll to
the left I see I explorer.exe so I know

138
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,740
that this file was created by Internet
Explorer and say I wanted to know

139
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:43,430
everything that the Internet Explorer
wrote to I can do that I can just switch

140
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:52,390
back over to the tap where it created a
different as the file i/o by process and

141
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:57,660
I can filter to that particular process
so what I'm doing here is I'm going to

142
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:02,040
explore and I'm going to filter on that

143
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:16,310
now this gives me all the other
different file i/o where I explore and I

144
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:20,939
can go to write and I can see everything
that road to see my father miles down

145
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:26,260
there and in a temple leaders and a few
other things the log file and MFT as

146
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:35,510
well that's just an example how how you
use the application at any questions on

147
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:45,220
that I know it's hard to see ok so let's
talk a little bit about event tracing

148
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:51,760
for Windows kernel level tracing
facility that lets you log colonel

149
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,760
application to find events to a log file
so this is the underlying feature in

150
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:02,439
Windows that allows the Performance
Toolkit to run other programs use this

151
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:09,470
other programs like pokémon pokémon
the underlying it's using event raising

152
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:15,780
for Windows this is kind of a diagram of
what that looks like so there's

153
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:21,900
controllers and the controllers
basically control what the providers do

154
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:26,180
and the providers in the bottom left the
providers are are listening for the

155
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:33,300
different events and then writing that
to a buffer so so the controller would

156
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,969
be the Windows Performance recorder that
we used at the beginning that interface

157
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,570
where we selected which profiles we
wanted to use and we told it to start

158
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:45,860
and stop and all that the providers were
part of when we selected the profiles

159
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:52,780
the providers were the underlying
listeners that it selected and when we

160
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:56,350
use the performance analyzer the
graphical interface that was the

161
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:02,520
consumer and basically what that was
doing was given us a view of the

162
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:08,260
different logs and offers as a recurring
so so those are the different parts you

163
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,040
can log

164
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,740
to a buffer and then you can save that
buffer to a file others different

165
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:19,720
settings that you can do that with the
performance took it so cool thing is

166
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:26,100
that you can write custom providers and
how to do that is beyond the scope of

167
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:35,480
this talk but there's an awesome blog by
Gustavson random ASCII tons of articles

168
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,769
on Windows Performance talk anytime I
searched for it came up this guy's blog

169
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:48,930
was the first hit in the second half was
Microsoft so there's also has three

170
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:55,099
really good videos and the first video
is kind of a walk through and how he

171
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,550
troubleshooting issue and he really
draws down and does a good job of it

172
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:05,139
explain it in detail so I highly
recommend the videos are on when select

173
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:11,179
now so it's a paid service but if you
sign up for Visual Studio Davis and

174
00:17:11,179 --> 00:17:19,679
Charles get a free trial of intellect
now so so that's a good way to to get to

175
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,110
get access to these videos and the
second video of his three video series

176
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:34,639
he walks you through creating custom
event provider or user interface so this

177
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:40,110
is you I for ETW and it's kind of like
the windows perform performance recorder

178
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:45,129
but there's there's a little bit more
features that you can do with it and

179
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:50,730
also it has by default is his custom
providers that he wrote there there are

180
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:55,400
already associated with this video

181
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:11,590
of using his user interface others a
drop-down I forgot to mention one of the

182
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:19,169
custom providers he wrote was for input
so anytime a mouse gets clicked it will

183
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:24,480
record that event and also keyboard
anytime just press the record that event

184
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:30,550
which is pretty cool so the drop down
for input racing a change that from

185
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:38,320
private for with private anytime you hit
a key it'll just recorded a record in a

186
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,639
ver negu hit on the keyboard when you
hit full record all the different keys

187
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,240
and that's you know if you're doing
tracing for someone else try to

188
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,010
troubleshoot an issuer or something like
that so I just trace start racing on the

189
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:58,710
recorder and I'm going to switch between
a couple of different applications so

190
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:02,260
I'm gonna type type of you things in
WordPad and then I'm gonna switch to

191
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:07,860
calc and then I'm gonna switch to Word
and type of you more characters

192
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:21,770
it's pretty pretty basic I'm gonna say
that traced to a buffer and done here

193
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:24,710
you can write some information about
your trades if you know your

194
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:32,070
troubleshooting a certain issue and when
you double-click down here

195
00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:39,090
open up in Windows Performance Analyzer
automatically just nice here I'm gonna

196
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,529
do I'm gonna do two different views

197
00:19:41,529 --> 00:19:48,289
I'm gonna look at the different windows
that were in focus which were just three

198
00:19:48,289 --> 00:20:02,289
windows I had WordPad calc and weird so
this time I just kind of shows that and

199
00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:10,629
he has one of his custom providers is
down that i'm gonna pull over its random

200
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:17,870
ass key event so I'm gonna drag that
graph over as well and I'm not really

201
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:22,289
interested in seeing the graph that are
more interested in the table so I'm

202
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:26,970
gonna show table only for that and at
the top

203
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:33,710
the windows in focus I'm interested in
just the the window just the graphic

204
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:37,429
that I'm not interested in the table
someone to take that out and Here I am

205
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:42,090
selecting his custom provider which is
multi-input and we'll take a look first

206
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:46,789
at the mouse clicks so if I click on
mousedown it shows me every time the

207
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:51,230
mouse was clicked and this makes sense
right because this is when I was working

208
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:59,940
when I was switching between different
windows and again when you select the

209
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,580
individual items in the table it
reflects it on the time I

210
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:18,740
next we'll go to the keyboard so he down
once I select this issues older keydown

211
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:25,430
events so you can see it basically when
I was in WordPad I was typing so you see

212
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:30,970
an event for their and and also you see
it inward toward the end that process at

213
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:37,160
the end and when you drop down and look
at the table you see you can see the

214
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:44,780
actual keys so it's showing it showing
the actual texts that I take 10

215
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:03,379
also wanted to mention a strange issue
that I had and I was troubleshooting in

216
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:07,210
the Windows Performance recorder it has
network i/o listed as one of the

217
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:14,270
profiles and I was clicking that and I
wasn't saying anything in WPA in the

218
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:19,950
performance analyzer and I didn't know
if it was because I was working in 2

219
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:25,289
p.m. or or what the problem was if I was
a recording it but I posted a question

220
00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:33,390
on random ASCII on the blog and i got
really really quick response he said I

221
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:41,159
suggested I go to trace system
configuration trade statistics and from

222
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:45,440
within their it shows me information
about the traits that are just recorded

223
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,890
and from there it showed me the
different providers that I used and I

224
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:54,520
could see that in fact it did it was
recording the network events and the

225
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:58,750
issue was basically it just wasn't
showing it in Windows performance

226
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:06,289
analyzer so so one of the things you can
do I wanted to verify that the actual

227
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:14,030
data was there I recorded it with a
provider so I used expert and I i a shy

228
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:19,000
for the input file so I looked at my
tray Sandusky OH it save it to a CSV

229
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:26,120
file and looking in that CSV file I went
through and I verified that the

230
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:31,178
different network traffic was there so I
saw TCP connections at all the inbound

231
00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:37,970
and outbound not be in the source and
destination port as well so it was

232
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:42,610
actually they're alright I have one more
video

233
00:23:55,549 --> 00:24:03,230
ok so this last video I'm interested in
heap allocations so I'm gonna pull the

234
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:09,519
graph over and stretches down again so
this shows all of the different heap

235
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:18,220
allocations that we're done during this
time and it also says that the size of

236
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:25,330
the allegations one of the really cool
things about this tour is you can do

237
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:31,340
stack traces so if I wanted to know when
that allocation occurred I can't hit the

238
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:37,220
drop down and get a stack trace from
that now you see question marks here

239
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:42,970
because i dont have symbols loaded if I
go up to the top

240
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:48,230
good at race load symbols its gonna load
of the symbol information you might not

241
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:52,919
have symbols for every application you
look at but a lot of the Microsoft

242
00:24:52,919 --> 00:25:06,850
products will will give you some Modi
going here with the drop-down I I can

243
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:13,519
see the different functions Windows
called all the way down to RTL allocate

244
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:18,210
he and that's pretty cool if you're
looking for maybe like a particular size

245
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:21,869
he delegation were or something along
those lines

246
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:36,070
and the next thing it shows I'm gonna
show is the fragmentation heat it shows

247
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:42,429
you the different pocket that it uses a
different block sizes and again I'm

248
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:50,700
gonna drop this down here I can see the
different allegations for the low

249
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,910
allocation he and another feature that's
pretty cool as you can highlight

250
00:25:54,910 --> 00:26:00,820
anywhere on the timeline and right click
and do them and basically it all

251
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:07,350
zoom in but it also take out anything in
the table that's not listed within that

252
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:16,419
time line here again it's hard to read
but you can see that the since we're

253
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:21,460
using the lip augmentation he these
allegations are adjacent to each other

254
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:31,090
and that can be useful for things like
writing a use after free exploit this is

255
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:37,060
file a like for you as from coral and
Curtis class he does advance exploit

256
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:44,270
development class it's a great class
highly recommend this past fall really

257
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,980
good stuff so if you get a chance for
Lancashire stuff is really great

258
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:57,410
so that's it for the heat stuff and
that's it

259
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,310
literally questions out there

260
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:26,280
show you the parent I D I have to go
back and check it but I believe it does

261
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,280
show that

262
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:50,610
it depends on when you want to do this
trace I so I would say not because event

263
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:54,570
viewers capturing all those that logs
and saving it to disk from a whole bunch

264
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:59,879
of different stuff that's going on with
this kind of the idea for this is if

265
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,420
you're having a problem on your system
you could start up this tool right the

266
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:09,800
Performance Toolkit and see if something
if you can identify what's going on

267
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:16,000
whereas event years running all the time
the guy Bruce Dawson he he runs in the

268
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,090
background its run in its use in five
percent of memories so he just keeps a

269
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:25,679
running in it so hard he works a lot
with performance and that's important to

270
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:30,780
him so he just run in the background so
I would say no it wouldnt replace event

271
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:37,410
you're the most things are good for is
maybe you're doing in installing you

272
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:41,570
want to see all the registry rights to
give written to disk there's some tools

273
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:46,659
that you like red shot you wanna see all
the files that get written to this was

274
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:50,380
like what's what's changed in other
tools like that but this can do it for

275
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:54,440
you put in kind of like a graphical
interface another thing I don't do

276
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:59,110
malware analysis but I think it would be
useful for that process is getting

277
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:03,550
spawned or network connections or things
like that that are going on behind the

278
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:07,909
scenes would be nice to know so idea
would be that he would start this off

279
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:13,150
when you're our sample in and get an
idea of kind of storing you can filter

280
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:18,250
that process and their questions

281
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:25,150
yes it's a mystery

282
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,660
yes you can order against you

283
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:42,820
installation files that you can give
someone else a record this and send it

284
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,149
to me and I'll take a look at what's
going on
