1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,620
so this isn't a mere talk about using
John I think most people in this room

2
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,400
use it if you don't know how to use it
you know Google and there's tons of

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:25,930
articles out there lots a lot more than
I can tell you so what what what the

4
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:32,700
topic is going to be about is using the
tool and a corporate environment and

5
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,920
some of the joy that you get pushed back
to you might get from management and

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:49,320
users when you do something like that so
let's jump into it I guess I heard

7
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:56,739
you're pretty much everything in my
contacts down the bottom until next

8
00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:02,419
Tuesday I'm part of that corporate
finance infrastructure taking a new job

9
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,979
after that so after a few beers I might
be a little bit more honest about some

10
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:17,840
of the details and corporate world there
are lawyers wanted me to say that so big

11
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:27,700
surprise I do have a mind of my own to
use it so I saw some of the reasons why

12
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:34,270
you would want to do this and I kind of
fell into this I wish I would have

13
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,210
planned it more

14
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:42,500
had a time but it's probably one of the
better ways to check and see how your

15
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:48,690
controls are working fine as you go
through some of this the first couple of

16
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:54,860
passes you'll find things that are
misconfigured servers that miss configs

17
00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:03,899
for user habits and as you collect more
data that you may find in this is

18
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:09,259
something that's been a pet peeve of
mine because I have this love real well

19
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:15,779
a relationship with auditors and they
push it they pushed the check box and

20
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,480
say ok you're in and everybody I know by
saying this but your minimum password

21
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,220
length is usually a ESA has some
combination of complex characters

22
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:32,170
whether it be numbers uppercase whatever
that was around when I started and I'm

23
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,319
old

24
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:42,530
Thank You season and computers are
faster things have changed that it's too

25
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:50,070
short it's it's not it's not strong
enough anymore so I ended up finding

26
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:56,660
when I started running this was actual
proof and the heart thing with without

27
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:01,739
having the proof is if you go to another
and say look I feel that 82 shortly

28
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:07,549
wanna bump it there especially at like
an internal auditor or third party that

29
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:11,840
comes in and just doesn't add on your
company they're stuck to the rules

30
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,269
they're like this is best practice so we
gotta go if that's packed this gives you

31
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:23,450
some data to go back with him and and
argue that point and I think we're gonna

32
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,298
have to start pushing back on some of
these auditing rules because they're

33
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:29,299
making us less secure my opinion

34
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,830
so is a few challenges that you got a
workout out before you can even start

35
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:42,530
doing this the first one really has to
come up with a server initially I

36
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:48,140
thought while I want the GPU box and
deal somebody's declined mining machine

37
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:56,790
or whatever that in a corporate world is
is hard sometimes there are pushing BM's

38
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:06,690
it's hard to build one off boxes and a
lot of reasons so I started doing it

39
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:13,850
with a small machine with just a small
p.m. it's got no horsepower and doing

40
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:20,130
some simple rules and I was still
popping passwords so what I found later

41
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:25,290
on was that this was a benefit because
when I went to manage better when I went

42
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,980
to a user I said hey look if your
passwords week and I like that we can

43
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:36,210
fit the rules like I'm on a little
laptop here and I did it in a couple of

44
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:41,210
days if I had a really big box I would
do it a couple of minutes you know you

45
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:45,219
sent me to send me the drag races with a
piano and I so

46
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:59,508
only old people get that panels were
slow season and so anyways I thought it

47
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:04,099
was a benefit now as time goes on in if
you start doing more and more machines

48
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:08,669
especially if you're doing a lot of
boxes that small boxes is going to have

49
00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:12,460
a hard time doing it but initially to
get you going to get that conversation

50
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:17,590
go on and get the political wheels
turning its get you going and so that

51
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:23,500
was one one thing that actually was was
a positive that I didn't think it was

52
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:34,190
and I see some of the other things that
turn more political as you get into this

53
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:40,940
is who gets to see the raw data who gets
to see the actual passwords obviously

54
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,229
you know some of the admins estoppel
wanna see it or they might be able to

55
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:49,690
change configuration settings to improve
things but you can't go put it on an

56
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:55,289
open file share for a home for everybody
to read either and dealing with

57
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:59,050
different teams like your Active
Directory jeans or Unix and Linux Data

58
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:05,349
Center dies they may or may not want to
give up access to that information to

59
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:10,630
begin with so there is some management
back and forth before you get before you

60
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,539
can start all of this

61
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:17,080
the other thing is to try and build
something disreputable the first couple

62
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:23,500
of rounds indicted on how I jumped into
a store run and uses a different

63
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,020
dictionaries doing some different
techniques and I get down like look at

64
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:35,560
all these past few really good shit I
forgot everything that I ran so over

65
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,169
time

66
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:41,590
scripted it up with with some basic
steps that have repeated over in time

67
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,590
and that makes consistent month-to-month
reports

68
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,140
and I started all of this on the UNIX
and Linux I'd mainly because of my

69
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:55,620
background and I already had access to
the shadow files and the data center so

70
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,990
I could I could begin doing it right
away and one thing I found in this comes

71
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:08,200
back to the configuration stuff I was
running across multiple hashing

72
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,710
algorithms so you have a single server
that would have or five different

73
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:19,320
hashing algorithms could be deposited
could be always up to 255 by 12 as much

74
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:24,270
as it supports near before five well
when you run John it can only do one of

75
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:34,130
the time so what ended up happening was
I found I found one account and only had

76
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:38,300
it crack down half a box as well the
user comes back to me and says you know

77
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:43,090
that's great but I think your your
script isn't working right because it's

78
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:49,109
the same password everywhere while 41
that's a bad practice but I went back

79
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,770
and looked and sure enough there was
three or four different I had to enter a

80
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:55,870
through three or four different times
with different hashing algorithms in

81
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:02,710
order to get all of that that makes your
process lot longer and the other thing

82
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:09,780
that happened to me that kind of a long
standing lined one of the audit or

83
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:14,400
something if we had had stressed that we
should push Shah 512 across the board

84
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:21,710
while we did that and then my runtime
started to really suffer because it's

85
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,700
got John's gonna work so much higher on
that has to go through all of the

86
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:32,500
combination and it kinda kicked me in
the leg and I didn't even know it was

87
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,740
common thing but it was a good thing at
least I saw that we made the change and

88
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:44,159
it was making impact so it's good it was
nice to see the change across from the

89
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,829
from a different perspective and

90
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:56,580
finally there's a lot of when you start
doing this is a lot of conversations I

91
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,330
have with management they don't
understand the tools they don't

92
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,670
understand

93
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:11,280
auditors updated a little bit so a lot
of communication has to go with your

94
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,300
upper levels i'm talking like your sea
level

95
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:19,199
exact type because they're seeing the
reports and you want to make sure they

96
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,000
understand it the other thing is as you
go out to the users say change it they

97
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,730
will push back sometimes and if you've
got that sea-level exact understanding

98
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:35,860
there really isn't much argument because
they come back and I'll have to show you

99
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:48,800
actually so again consider starting with
that that small crack and server I think

100
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,170
I think that helped a lot

101
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:57,069
dad is a low hanging fruit first it sees
it tell you if you got a problem when I

102
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:01,940
initially the first time that we ran a
tight one little story we had a internal

103
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:07,030
audit he comes in and he found a weak
password on one machine ended up being

104
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:13,470
the root password on a Linux box and it
was from the that somebody built and it

105
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:19,040
had to do follow the guide new root
password 12 p.m. is bill nobody ever

106
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:26,870
went manually changed it came to me says
you know I found this and so what we

107
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:30,730
gonna do to fix it and so we started
looking at it goes well how many other

108
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:35,050
times the day they miss it and we had a
thousand 1500 Linux boxes and I'm like

109
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:41,890
to check every one of the nice thing we
went check there's like two other ones

110
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:47,020
so the guys are doing their job he
missed a couple that I got lucky but

111
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,680
still that got the ball

112
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:59,649
the next when you're setting these up
and started to build these things I

113
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:04,130
would say that start with dictionaries
the ones on the web are fantastic in tho

114
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:14,050
get you a lot of hit make your own and
you can start small with it I started

115
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:17,880
with the John Lewis that comes with a
with the program and then just built on

116
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,899
an overtime because I do the
vulnerability assessments and I'm also

117
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:27,640
tied in with a pen testing internally I
had access to some of the pen test and

118
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,459
when they found a password or if I was
doing one and I found the password I

119
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:35,969
just sort of my dictionary and wouldn't
worry about it if it catches it catches

120
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:45,310
it if it doesn't it doesn't great and if
I am I looking at a machine or something

121
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:51,390
I find threads in a script I just throw
it in there I don't really worry about

122
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:55,949
chasing the guy down to tell me that fix
something I worried more that catch it

123
00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:02,560
if that's really valid I'll catch
eventually in this process and that that

124
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,279
seemed to work out well some other
tricks that I picked up over time

125
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:15,209
use like addresses or river names of the
state that your company is in a where

126
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:20,920
they're working a lot of people use like
regional areas baseball teams football

127
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,479
teams sports teams that type of thing
but think that regional area that we're

128
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:31,310
the people are working from that works
well in a corporate world they love to

129
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:42,060
outsource so for example if if you're
out sourcing teams are all in India or

130
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:46,329
mexico or wherever it is go out and get
a dictionary for that language Spanish

131
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:50,420
put that in there just put it in there
just see what happens in may not get it

132
00:12:50,420 --> 00:13:01,050
my and and that'll get you started and
once you have it set you have say he

133
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:04,779
cracked and passwords with that now you
can look at it and say ok now I start to

134
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:08,800
see some patents M-eighty they're
putting numbers at the end

135
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,620
humans if they're going to have to put a
capital letter and put it in the front

136
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:19,029
so so you can run your mass switches do
just upper and your your first character

137
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:22,350
then maybe do a couple of lower case

138
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:26,820
man maybe that put a number two numbers
right in the middle and then put the

139
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:32,029
rest will be all lower-case so you can
do the mask of that pattern only in that

140
00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:37,769
only runs in about 18 hours on a small
box thing just run it and see what

141
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:44,389
happened try a different combinations
move those digits around there is some

142
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:51,209
different rule sets from CoreLogic has
won it runs a long time but if you run

143
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:56,180
it with a different rules that a
dictionary you'll get additional hit

144
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:00,630
they abandon prepend a time here

145
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:07,769
want different tricks but by then you'll
start to see more patterns as you keep

146
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:17,160
doing this over and over again and then
that's it really that is the process to

147
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:23,370
do that over to do that rinse and repeat
process and you'll end up with a with a

148
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:28,829
set of passwords and what we we did try
to do in this goes back to the have nots

149
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:36,050
small server we set a time limit to sell
I said like you gonna give me all the

150
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:39,620
eighty credentials and that was that was
political to get in first place but

151
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:45,220
contentious give me 10 days I'm gonna go
on my Pinto and I'm gonna see what I can

152
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,529
get

153
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:50,759
and then I just go through all of this
stuff and you only gave me ten days and

154
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:54,370
you only give me a little server I
should really get that much if you're if

155
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:59,339
your controls are in place and you know
if you come in I usually try to have a

156
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:04,399
goal like if I can get 30% of what I was
given and I feel like I did pretty good

157
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:11,449
and if I had a GPU box it would be
higher so that's what we did it's been

158
00:15:11,449 --> 00:15:20,550
working out so far and the next the next
big trick is working with the users to

159
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,550
get things change

160
00:16:31,920 --> 00:17:03,729
so there's a couple of different
messages are very popular for me and

161
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:07,480
like I said I crop probably fifty or
sixty of them that I was running through

162
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:15,160
over and over again and I had the luxury
of having two servers so I took some

163
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:20,970
longer masking selecting character links
and tried those and just let that run on

164
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:26,860
another server that ran for like a week
why I could merge in back in later why

165
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:37,229
like the top now there's one little
thing at the bottom because I'm season

166
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:42,429
and cause I like to get my kids a hard
time words with friends but I found a

167
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:47,049
good use for it there's tons of sites
out there with all the legal

168
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:53,129
three-letter words or words with friends
so he could do this with foreign matters

169
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:58,200
five whatever it so do a little loop
here where where it starts with a three

170
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:04,040
letter word and then the a is just any
character after that and just threw it

171
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:08,409
over and over again you can repeat that
for you could put your digits and around

172
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:11,250
that that was successful

173
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:16,669
the other thing I'll say to you when you
start doing this you'll learn a lot of

174
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:20,039
things about your music community

175
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:29,830
one final story it's fine to me I was
standing on this guy for weeks and weeks

176
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:35,408
to change his password cuz I kept track
and it finally in the password was fuck

177
00:18:35,409 --> 00:18:41,899
you so I was like ok that's nice and so
he finally changes it and he pops up on

178
00:18:41,899 --> 00:18:46,570
the report the next week and change that
the fuck you with a two at the end of it

179
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:58,178
so I almost wanted to let that go cuz it
was funny but whatever so that I could

180
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:01,179
drag you going to do more more drag here

181
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:44,480
idea

182
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:14,440
that's why I like my tractor alright so
the other thing and I'll say don't do

183
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:22,989
what I did and just go all the passwords
I got and give it to the CTO and leave I

184
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:27,739
i don't i don't know why I was like you
can use Excel you do it that didn't go

185
00:20:27,739 --> 00:20:40,210
over so I went back to school and learn
communication and it doesn't have to be

186
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:44,759
really tricky but with something like
this we're gonna break it down to him

187
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:48,739
and this is nice and pretty but it's
kinda what you would expect since you're

188
00:20:48,739 --> 00:20:54,659
doing all those masks rules with eight
you're gonna get the most inundate you

189
00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:58,879
get you started ninth and tenth from
dictionary words and then those John

190
00:20:58,879 --> 00:21:02,908
rules that are adding on to it as you
get higher and higher when you get

191
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:07,489
really high those are probably from you
know getting them from a shell script or

192
00:21:07,489 --> 00:21:10,859
something like that and there there were
long and complex just happened to steal

193
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:17,129
it or you ran me the cats or whatever
whatever the case was and I'll tell you

194
00:21:17,129 --> 00:21:20,590
this to people push back our delight
while you find that and you catch that

195
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:25,449
that would never happen so I'm not
change it like I found it I shouldnt

196
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,750
have so shut up

197
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:33,630
but anyways this this makes it really
easy for the sea levels when you come to

198
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:38,950
him you say look here it got there is no
the real date is not here but this is

199
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:45,240
kind of what we ended up with and like I
said this is kind of light that's

200
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:51,450
perfect it's easy to explain in real
life you'll end up with little blips so

201
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:55,580
you might have I don't know fifteen
character spike up or something like

202
00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:06,139
that and they'll pick the spikes and
status and okay we've gotta act on all

203
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:11,420
of these and get them fix wise 15 so
high you know and I'll start asking

204
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:16,800
questions so had that in the back here
had before and it's really easy if you

205
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,000
have a spreadsheet all separated out you
know where your counselor what they are

206
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,400
you can take a look at them you know you
could have tons of different reasons why

207
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,620
why why every once in a while you'll
have a spike just know what your data is

208
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:38,449
before you go in front of the Seas think
there's any other tidbits

209
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:51,550
for

210
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:10,080
so well and I did start to use Pipal
what I found it though it was a little

211
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,830
bit overlooked for some of the exacts
they got caught up with all of the

212
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:18,730
different line items and they didn't
tell the story so this is the other

213
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:24,000
thing this story that I wanted to get
out of this was we've gotta get we gotta

214
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:39,310
get that link longer and here's why I
got so all I did was I took all of the

215
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:44,780
passwords and then I just wrote a shell
script it did work out and I put the

216
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:51,460
account right now so I two columns show
that into Excel and then just so there

217
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:55,820
you've got it all in there and then then
it's easy to go you know where my little

218
00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:00,110
blips coming from all of that kind of
stuff that's all there really protective

219
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:06,969
of that spread she was only 45 people in
the company should have that but that's

220
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:20,830
it is really really easy as about it or
line shell script it's not so that's

221
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:23,830
about me see if I can figure out how to
get back to

222
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:40,629
so

223
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:47,610
now the now that you've embarrass people
what do you do and and this is this one

224
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:53,250
I still struggle with because I'm
getting a lot of pushback extending the

225
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:57,760
eighth nobody wants to do it they're
afraid of third parties coming in and if

226
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:07,290
your third party's all-powerful gonna
run the show me why i think its it

227
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:11,190
doesn't even start with a technical
changes user training and you can do

228
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:18,130
some pretty simple things you know
telling remember remember your favorite

229
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:23,630
song and pick out the first letters of
each one and don't put don't do patterns

230
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:27,800
and I was even thinking about running
through one of these in front of people

231
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:33,450
going here's how easy it is if you don't
put your capital in the first one

232
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:37,040
don't put exclamation points or special
characters at the end

233
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:41,680
change things up a little bit and I'm
not going to get it that way

234
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:45,360
not not through these massacres unless I
get really lucky and you've made it

235
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:52,209
harder for other people as well so I
really if a perfect world I would say

236
00:25:52,210 --> 00:26:00,800
the minimum length about 20 and drop the
complexity rules all together and and

237
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,899
let it go at that and then do the user
training and then then it becomes really

238
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:10,760
difficult to do these kinds of tricks to
get very many passwords I just gonna

239
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:18,830
have a hard time even with a GPO box and
if it's after that may or may not work

240
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:24,970
politically and depending on your
corporate environment but if you do the

241
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:27,600
user training because he can improve it
that way

242
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,639
the nice thing we're doing this is you
can measure it now you can just

243
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:39,660
auditors in management love trending
chart so over time you've got numbers

244
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:43,270
and sell hey look we've made an
improvement or user training is working

245
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:50,410
or it's not the other thing that would
help have your Active Directory team

246
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:54,870
give you a little bit more information
about those hashing about those user IDs

247
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:59,020
what is issued to they belong in maybe
you have to focus your training in a

248
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:03,310
certain area or certain region or
whatever but you can use some of the

249
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:14,060
data that they have put it together and
and make some change out of this and I

250
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:18,879
think I mean I'm not this far I don't
know if these are good ideas are bad but

251
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,080
I think that is the least I could
measure it

252
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:37,090
so I don't know what the time as a head
but if you guys gonna literally you'll

253
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:43,399
hate me these are the two links that I
like lived and breathed when I started

254
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,950
all of this is the first one is from the
guys from CoreLogic they do the crack me

255
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:55,140
if you can stop in Vegas this PDF walks
through a lot of the masking techniques

256
00:27:55,140 --> 00:28:01,679
plus some other neat little tricks that
I live that document I found it really

257
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,919
helpful and then if you want to expand
Aires school security he's got a time

258
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:15,720
and you can hold those you begin to play
11 other little bit if you've got if you

259
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,480
just wanna play with this crap at home
and you're just got on your laptop and I

260
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:27,030
know you're all on Linux make password
is a Unix commands are you can make your

261
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:33,950
own password hashes and make your own
dictionary make your own files to

262
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:37,679
practice with i mean obviously you're
making the password you know what's in

263
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,720
there but you can you can play with it
without having to steal somebody else's

264
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:54,690
I found helpful so it's probably really
early like to be some questions I hope

265
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:57,240
ya

266
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:07,610
because I'm seasoned I think that I have
to be honest I pick the tool that I was

267
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:13,530
most comfortable with long-term what I
thought was I was gonna end up with a

268
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:18,889
combination of both because I think it
has cat has its advantages in certain

269
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:23,730
areas and I was hoping to have that
monster GPU box and I would be run in

270
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:26,780
both in and use them for their
advantages

271
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:33,520
the other thing gt-r has so many
understand so many different algorithms

272
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:38,310
and my my long-term another long-term
hope was I'd love to do this on

273
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:48,030
databases I i know i would destroy them
for a while or you know some of the

274
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:50,379
other stuff that's out there

275
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:56,230
ATR's gonna be able to handle a lot of
it so I just kind of started there

276
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:21,780
now it's something I forgot to mention I
think a little bit I did in my political

277
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:28,110
jumps I got the houses from a D but they
didn't give me the user accounts and

278
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:31,830
they did it for a good reason that they
did they said well I can go and change

279
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,250
somebody's benefit information or
whatever and I didn't really need that

280
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:40,190
so I was just working off the house so I
depended more on my dictionaries and

281
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:43,910
well being local to the company so

282
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:11,750
and doesn't think I'm sorry

283
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:37,390
so the question is maybe I should go and
some of the other if we're going to the

284
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:44,440
the lengthy reduce the complexity of the
18th team and ask them to set some mass

285
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:54,490
I'm sorry I'm settings to complement
everything the other thing they just

286
00:31:54,490 --> 00:32:01,070
made me think of two thought about even
extending the the time for changing the

287
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:04,070
password if we really did see an
improvement

288
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:10,290
highway 90 days is too short I mean in
in the nice thing with that is you could

289
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:14,170
go to the users say look I know I'm
making it really long time taken off

290
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:21,520
some of your other day and make it make
it a little bit more but I think the

291
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,430
user training is going to help that more
than anything else

292
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:36,130
ya koi mining box

293
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:53,350
I haven't had one but from what I've
read i guess im video from I was just

294
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:56,790
looking at pricing things that looks to
be about 54 and you could buy pretty

295
00:32:56,790 --> 00:33:03,670
decent box at that point but like I said
I never even got to play with it with

296
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:06,670
the big our way

297
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,970
I'm sorry the the question was what do
you recommend in terms of hardware for

298
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:28,460
those larger boxes and I'm not there I
haven't been lucky enough to work on one

299
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:31,460
yet

300
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:43,870
with all the Bitcoin miner has been
going on there's there's another

301
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:50,360
information about building a box out
there and and he really anything is

302
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:54,189
going to be a lot better than that small
00 p.m. that I use so it's gonna be a

303
00:33:54,190 --> 00:34:05,450
big improvement I guys I'm sorry if I
ran too short but I'm hungry
