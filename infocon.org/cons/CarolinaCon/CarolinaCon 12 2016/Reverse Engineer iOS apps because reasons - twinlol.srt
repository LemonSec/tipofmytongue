1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,760
hello what the deal

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:17,330
yeah so welcome everyone thank you so
much for having me thank you vic for

3
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:22,209
putting this condo again you and your
team have been to be here for my second

4
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:29,599
year is gone I came here exclusively now
twice just for this corn witch who does

5
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:42,870
that stupid so I had a really bad life
decisions last night and this morning

6
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:53,130
stopped showing up about 20 minutes ago
so this is gonna be like talk equivalent

7
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:59,550
of humans so if you one of those people
who like a dork out a Deadpool is you

8
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,369
sort of like a bit intense there's a
lockpick village like way down that way

9
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:09,310
far enough away that you won't hear me
that would not be a terrible idea the

10
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:14,340
corn is also not responsible for this is
real number for the con is not

11
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,500
responsible for any of the content or
words by presented that's on me so

12
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,750
please don't take it out on anyone else

13
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:31,490
ok so they introduced me but I thought
to further my own embarrassment I would

14
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:35,589
include pictures and have been more
information about myself that people who

15
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,780
apparently call themselves my friends
when I'm not in the country they preach

16
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,780
shit out of me and take it places

17
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,020
so I've been on the hit TV show scorpion
once or twice in extra and I'm also the

18
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:56,610
cyber language expert for the Scorpion
as well so many things like 747 hakim

19
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:03,250
particular that was me I promise you
that is the truth so I'm the this is the

20
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,250
first thing about the honorary CEO fails
TRAI

21
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:14,880
import-export think tank based research
and development very interesting ones

22
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,890
I'm I put Allen's total one time I mean
last week I put a land title in a

23
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,559
pineapple and then put a rubber ducky on
and try to go on the internet and then

24
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:29,239
factor how it works like three hours and
nothing happened so maybe next year talk

25
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:36,569
suggestion please help me question
whatever you like but there is a

26
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:41,589
condition Eugene rules are in effect I
am the first presented this year to do

27
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:46,650
you drink which is really exciting and
you gotta love it because I born in

28
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:55,810
Australia delicacy with me very
expensive amazing we better get a move

29
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:56,340
on

30
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:02,480
ok I need a lift my energy

31
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,920
to get my great energy back so you drink

32
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:21,490
little bit of trivia about growing
number one it's 2 p.m. so this is

33
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:28,780
totally cool during his the official
drink of 14 2012 27 year olds in

34
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:35,600
Australia and it's also popular with
college students because you can get

35
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,710
like 30 standard drinks which is like
you know what Jim I enjoying last night

36
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:45,610
for about six bucks I mean six mile
packages yeah just so you understand

37
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:52,620
what i'm saying six month mark is not
always so the other figure 4 in the

38
00:03:52,620 --> 00:04:01,810
unlabeled pictures is a clothes line
will host the game that we play is

39
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:08,720
called during a fortune and how junior
fortune is like wheel of fortune but not

40
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:18,410
their end of the talk so what you doing
as you can see it's like a wholesome

41
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,170
family event we got like all kinds of
people getting involved

42
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:30,830
little kids just love watching you play
trivial a good fortune

43
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,920
what you do is you hanging on the
clothesline voice and then you spin that

44
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:49,720
thing around and whoever stops in front
of hills with me but I do have my

45
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,720
helpful assistance

46
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:05,070
who's standing and a good height like
aeration of the girl into your mouth so

47
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:10,659
if you are if you ask me a question or
you just wanna join Australian delicacy

48
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:17,600
just come up and enjoy it's also rude to
decline an offer from another culture of

49
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:25,270
sampling like shit and I know americans
really like to be rude but not this time

50
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:36,200
also not my peers but it's not I can
prove it

51
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,760
ones one moment when I prove it

52
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:15,539
the actual learning of so why the fuck
would you want to reverse engineered iOS

53
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:22,720
app anyway like FBI dormant cyber
pathogens diamond cyber pathogen site

54
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:30,860
with me on that side by side by side but
I don't be on the next season Escorpion

55
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:36,790
promise you already written the script
drunk as fuck last night at the script

56
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:43,110
and send it to them to pay me $5 readers
that's that's what my focus and then

57
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:48,860
they get the harder so like nearly every
iOS app I've ever looked at has pretty

58
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,740
significant privacy issues

59
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:57,960
alongside 102 security issues like
Instagram thing that I don't use but

60
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:05,539
somehow I like a billion dollars they
had like some holy shit things wrong

61
00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:10,849
with their happen to like light lost you
sorry we had in the last autumn's

62
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:22,810
alright where's like everything that we
learn about applications and then like

63
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,810
when bucket

64
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:32,649
and then of course the other thing is
that like everything else access to all

65
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:41,020
your freaking cameras and pictures and
it's why I like to pull up on a lion get

66
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:48,808
confused yeah one important thing to
note about this talk is the intended

67
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:55,039
audience already reverse engineer Iowa
sites like just don't olympic village

68
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:07,919
inn built by Joe some shit you will
enjoy this i believe i mean so what I

69
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:13,080
want to do is give everyone else of
fuels reverse engineer and iOS and see

70
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,508
how accessible it is because it'll be
here was reverse engineer and iOS and

71
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:23,929
like so is like a year's worth of
research in MacBook Pro gonna buy not

72
00:08:23,929 --> 00:08:30,239
expensive software crap the goal of this
talk is to show you how to do it cheaply

73
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,649
as possible that's what we're going to
try and show you things will be great

74
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:42,839
value for your time and the second thing
I want to do inside of that skip a lot

75
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:47,779
of stuff there is a whole message
section of things I'm not even going to

76
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:58,709
mention so I hope that isn't the pot if
someone came here to listen to the other

77
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:04,410
cool thing and I'm interested in privacy
reasons is like rapid and advertising

78
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:16,889
and monetization by third parties and
Audrey networking and computing shoot so

79
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:22,790
your average at even paid ones
especially the paid ones I call you

80
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:27,870
least like 10 different advertising or
remarketing which sounds rather

81
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:34,160
innocuous in some ways depending on what
this is but the other thing is from a

82
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,480
developer's point of view you might go
to significant amount of trouble

83
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,530
preparing your shit and making it good
and then you like will need to make some

84
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:45,939
money off these fucking things so let's
ladies and advertising and it just one

85
00:09:45,940 --> 00:10:01,280
does all your good work and I'm that
she's covering the methodology like no

86
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:06,370
getting around the world garden because
the walled garden have it has its

87
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:10,060
advantages but it does make during
walking around with things kinda

88
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:18,270
difficult Apple devices favorite I'm not
only an Apple device and then I bought

89
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:29,340
one recently in libraries injury to
shoot I like it when I can do stuff so

90
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,620
things are you speaking to someone last
night like what are you talking about a

91
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:40,550
mic and they're like you talking about
reverse engineering and that sounds

92
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:44,120
difficult and hard and boring and stupid
and i dont wanna know it sounds terrible

93
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:50,470
he's actually here in the audience and
and basically what I said is

94
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,939
not that bad we can do this together
said please please come up here all my

95
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:14,430
head injuries and John John with the
thought bag plz plz yeah yeah

96
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:23,239
333 claps it's true americans really
love clapping is another thing I know

97
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:33,440
it's great yeah it's not like he's gotta
turn the tap it tastes like it's

98
00:11:46,150 --> 00:12:05,189
people were pulled like four fours and
websites is by grannies and ship it

99
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:08,190
something about it on Twitter or
whatever

100
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:16,480
ok but the thing about it is that and
what what I would you take away from

101
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,300
this is the shit they're about to do you
actually want to do a bug bounty or just

102
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,510
look at it if you put it on a jailbreak
device a lot of good apps something she

103
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:41,220
once because i dont have like jailbreak
protections to go to stop them what's up

104
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:48,520
with that anyone didn't get up and leave
when I mention that I'm talking to your

105
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,390
ignore the right hand side and slide has
like interesting things I live in the

106
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:57,610
middle of nowhere like nine hours from
an international airport so like and I'm

107
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:05,760
tired so I like get bitten by things all
the time so the boring stuff to get

108
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:18,130
started I'm not even going to do a whole
bunch of things around at some point

109
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:24,280
like a second hand iPad 2 so the first
thing I have always liked refurbished

110
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:29,980
iPad 2 $100 orders which is roughly and

111
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:36,800
when and then you know I can have on
there and I miss around with things so

112
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,420
yeah clutches like the the tool that
does a lot of the work it's like an

113
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:47,699
executable number it's not like there
are lots of God's children so I'm gonna

114
00:13:47,700 --> 00:14:19,450
say is make sure you capitalize the C
otherwise it doesn't do anything and you

115
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:25,040
go to executable double it electro house
shares ago sorry I didn't do it like

116
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:31,189
like you and then you are getting old
shit well then you install clutch 21

117
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:34,010
then you realize it's really different
and all warnings like this is a

118
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:37,090
diversion it doesn't fucking work and
say that you play around with it and it

119
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:43,360
does the same thing it actually puts the
32 bit body temp file and then it works

120
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:51,450
just so stories that like 64 bit
wineries are fucked really hard work

121
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:54,730
with and nothing seems to work properly
on them

122
00:14:54,730 --> 00:15:02,070
least all like the free chips that I so
he's going to attempt on you find the

123
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:06,860
one with the right time stamp and then
you just sucked out to you

124
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:16,740
sheen your laptop what I really wanted
to do was to a live demo here where

125
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:25,380
unlike the Apple store and fuck me
something let's pick it together because

126
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:31,240
I wouldnt boring so what I did is I did
a trial run like on the plane and that

127
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,250
trying to figure out before two
different women are sleeping pills so

128
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:51,399
that was cool so I just went to the
business at section and picked one and I

129
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:56,060
recognizable names like when people send
me emails like sent from my mobile using

130
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:00,989
XYZ like I recognize i play with that is
that people have been emailing me that

131
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:09,889
like a lot of sensitive data private
health information important so I picked

132
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:13,230
up one it has a friend a paid version
which was also what I want to cause a

133
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:17,259
lot of people like opal used to freak
out like it was terrible

134
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:27,339
the product page 10 just as bad if not
worse right it's just the time seems

135
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:32,410
like when you put dollars on it it's
actually a marketing technique because

136
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:37,569
you spend any more time on it it's like
an indicator of quality like if you paid

137
00:16:37,569 --> 00:16:43,439
$200 to come to this conference is that
forty you would expect a higher quality

138
00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:48,469
talk with his 14 starters but you're
also she like you got more value out of

139
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:51,470
it would actually be paying attention

140
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:58,230
so what I did is on taking the daughter
from my trial run and done my best to

141
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:03,680
black out the identified as of this
thing which took three cars like I

142
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:10,379
missed so much the first two times I was
really just a pretty like eyes on the

143
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:19,320
prize details man asked anyone yet
another recovering like file systems

144
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:26,260
database SQLite director it's fun it's
not good for this kind of crap like I

145
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:30,640
said this point on the internet and
almost everyone in this room has browser

146
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:42,780
file directory or used before so it's
basically is a prepaid Virgin thing it's

147
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,910
a mail app it had its beautiful
interface and it's really good at

148
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:51,680
managing multiple email accounts and I
actually really watched it from a just

149
00:17:51,680 --> 00:18:01,880
actually steering around with it so yeah
it's $3 do use fully at like 215 markers

150
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:10,510
or however you pronounce it when
something's $0.15 so I thought we might

151
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:15,300
do is demonstrate the difference when
the free and paid up and I can tell you

152
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:22,200
when one sentence they both the same I
don't know what happens when you pay for

153
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:32,680
it when you don't pay for it because I
noticed changes like it all so I start

154
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,560
with traffic analysis which surprises
not actually reverse engineering but

155
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:43,090
that's what we gonna talk about a couple
of minutes actually so the driving you

156
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:47,199
know sees that in a device that wasn't
jailbroken because the app would let me

157
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,659
run it on a jailbroken

158
00:18:48,659 --> 00:18:54,460
thing is like it's like hitting two
birds don't know once what you do is you

159
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:59,679
get to look at the the application and
see how it works so when you like

160
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,869
messing around with the code you
actually understand what's happening but

161
00:19:03,869 --> 00:19:07,580
it also lets you feel the database with
information that might be private

162
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:11,228
information that you can flag for laid
off and then also to watch the traffic

163
00:19:11,229 --> 00:19:50,929
actually like getting three birds 2012
so you can see it's like a Ave CBS

164
00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:55,049
through core application functionality
which is exactly what you expected to do

165
00:19:55,049 --> 00:20:00,429
but I did find that and when I answered
my email account about two minutes after

166
00:20:00,429 --> 00:20:05,570
all the initial shit happened was that
it it switch back to http and then

167
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:11,710
expose my email address and the AP like
a couple of things which was which is

168
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:17,619
the second picture so then the third
picture is a little bit more interesting

169
00:20:17,619 --> 00:20:24,908
story to share my PHP SessionID over
HTTP the token didn't check the Tokyo

170
00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:27,820
earlier this morning

171
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:34,260
the token still hadn't reset and it's
been days which is also shared of HTTP

172
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:41,770
what my fucking mail account so I had a
fair bit too . and you can imagine and

173
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:45,510
so much advertising stuff like I just
couldn't keep up with it all there was

174
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:51,300
just so much shit everywhere and then
what I was noticing was doing was it was

175
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:55,379
sharing the API case it was using to
pull down my mail three different

176
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:02,960
advertises which is good because that's
what I want I want targeted advertising

177
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:19,920
from my corporate email accounts that's
what I want I mean it feels kind of

178
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:26,190
redundant to mention here obviously if
someone's you're in a lot of trouble if

179
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:31,310
you are using this thing because you
know things are not going so great for

180
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:37,679
you I will mention I would like to see
it doing because that's probably

181
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,310
important instead of just like causing
all these problems saying anything

182
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:46,490
positive I would like to see you like so
the calls to retrieve the external API

183
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:51,320
information rather than device codes
which is another thing was doing if the

184
00:21:51,320 --> 00:22:00,510
device has to make a vehicles which they
need to write like to see it and then

185
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:07,080
you shouldn't really be storing the keys
I think that's stupid if it needs to see

186
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:14,949
if we need is a Pik then there's nowhere
really good on Android or iOS devices to

187
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:22,640
store that kind of shoe but the key
chains like but yeah I'm not going to

188
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,920
talk about the impact of like traffic
being middle because

189
00:22:27,640 --> 00:23:32,240
security screen or like had little
positive ads but it had an idea for a

190
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,900
which means it someone's making money
and it's not Apple they are but not from

191
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:44,250
this like this so it was sharing this
idea that seven networks but which is

192
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:52,530
against but Apple have promised two
years ago on the market lacked

193
00:23:52,530 --> 00:24:00,540
regulatory is that they are not going to
allow this anymore and like I said I put

194
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:10,920
this down so Apple miss this and it's
very easy to detect what that tells me

195
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:16,100
is that Apple's AAPL pay system hangs
over issues as well so when people do

196
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,980
this and don't yell at me and they miss
it

197
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:23,740
which i think's important indicator of
that everyone's like will the Apple

198
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:30,600
Store checks role is dropping its secure
and shit and if you don't like the

199
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:39,219
Chinese developer mode just pulled out
of random shit from

200
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:43,220
like this affects the bottom line and
they miss it so it's a privacy issue

201
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:52,789
that uses that doesn't directly impact
the bottom line they definitely talk

202
00:24:52,789 --> 00:24:58,179
about disassembly which is what I'm
supposed to go out from 20 mins ago so

203
00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:03,020
we're talking about hope not to
disassemble gonna be using it works on

204
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:10,280
Linux and OSX and this is the main part
of things where you know the lessons

205
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:15,750
about doing this without using OSX if
you don't like being a sex person where

206
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:24,480
we can show you some stuff around that
has a demo version as well but if you

207
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:31,110
are using this for more than 30 minutes
it'll session firstly but if you've used

208
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:36,668
for more than 30 minutes you actually
like it costs $30 so it's pretty cheap

209
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:42,480
vs idea approaches like to grab you can
get your employer to buy it for you

210
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:56,500
properties I still use hopper and I
still so what we're looking at here is

211
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,710
architecturally talked earlier on
architecture and under really qualified

212
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:05,900
to tell you are so I'm just going to
mention a couple of times and then move

213
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:13,190
on to the part that I do so since the
iPhone 5 is on 64 bit infrastructure

214
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:20,090
sitting alongside 32 bit as well no
further complicate things which is

215
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:25,090
effectively a low-power setting any time
an application is not retrieving an

216
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:30,049
external function it's supposed to run
in and that's important for later during

217
00:26:30,049 --> 00:26:33,700
the disassembly for trying to remove
their certificate pinning a jailbreak

218
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:38,710
check advertisements in a game or you
wanna cheated again whatever it's

219
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:41,270
important to know whether the
applications running

220
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:45,730
like full blown motor or whether it's
running otherwise you'll know operate

221
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:54,160
the wrong thing and then get confused
when proper is reciprocally designed for

222
00:26:54,160 --> 00:27:01,420
Apple family OS X's so like a new hybrid
OS X and that kind of stuff so the cool

223
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:09,000
thing about it is that machine code is
kind of like butts you don't get and

224
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,320
what you can do is you can go to a
retainer subverting and then just press

225
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:20,600
a button and it makes it look like this
which so much more than I can and you

226
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,629
know that's really really handy to get
started it really like lowers the

227
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:29,300
barrier to entry to doing disassembly
when you can actually like machine card

228
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:42,129
capitals here on my screen to tell you
about is if you are starting out with

229
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:46,040
you do not trying to mess with the
global variable and to you like pretty

230
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:50,510
comfortable with this otherwise you end
up with like a lot of orphans and I you

231
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:54,670
run out of memory crash so if you've
been trying to remove advertisements

232
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:58,010
from something that you don't want to
have advertisements or you can use it

233
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:02,660
that state need to be careful if you
decide to do further improvements

234
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:10,260
a simple demonstration on how are you
and I want you to just like use your

235
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:14,710
imagination to your home you can remove
that I could remove this from my thing

236
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:23,590
accidents happen when you're doing this
kind of stuff actually she knew it was

237
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:31,310
going under bun don't forget that so
yeah let's let's get started with that

238
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:36,908
the first thing you do is buy posit
bipasa I can jailbreak for you

239
00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:41,450
it's it's going to show us things you
need to do note the spelling of

240
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:51,669
jailbreak yet that's how it smells gaol
remember that the only place in the

241
00:28:51,669 --> 00:29:02,139
world that way that's actually not sure
what we're gonna do he's going to bypass

242
00:29:02,139 --> 00:29:07,719
job right check on this mobile out and
then we gotta go easily just reassemble

243
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:12,519
the application with no jailbreak check
so what you would do when you doing that

244
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:15,940
with your iDevices you're you're from
the thing putting it on your machine

245
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:22,570
doing your thing and then putting it
back on I think so you know you can just

246
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:29,309
look at that but something like 50 or so
other console modifications really like

247
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:36,658
speed up the process for you some other
times it can be headed to remove this

248
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:42,129
dropped from a nap that's like the
things that might like our client side

249
00:29:42,129 --> 00:29:53,769
validation checks easier ways to do that
a lot easier ways to do that but there

250
00:29:53,769 --> 00:30:01,269
are times when that can be a good thing
to do when you want to find a function

251
00:30:01,269 --> 00:30:09,190
to know right you can search like
boolean values by just typing in hope of

252
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:14,820
something like is no real can and then
you can see all the different variables

253
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:22,369
you can play with trivially so what
we're doing here is we've opened hope

254
00:30:22,369 --> 00:30:26,590
for the people of the back in the left
hand side at the top of the search

255
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:31,039
fields and we're just talking cracked
and then the first thing that comes up

256
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:35,840
is the thing that we need to know what
we've done is we've just selected all

257
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:43,580
the card after the Porsche and then you
go down just before you hit the pole

258
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:47,730
so now that you've hit the pop you
you've got a lot selected you're good to

259
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:48,150
go

260
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:56,400
so what you gonna do it then you just
get a right click the file and press so

261
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:03,930
if you selected lost you know by Sephora
Boolean function returns you to select

262
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:13,350
Modify assemble region and then add
mir's 0000 or you know you can just put

263
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:19,649
a 2001 or any other other value 0 if you
wanted to get a false

264
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:43,140
so in the fall to return false 0 so on
the screen now we've got some shit from

265
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:47,710
Harper again this is on some things I
mentioned this before this sometimes a

266
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:53,559
different depending on what you doing
what you're seeing here for the people

267
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:58,500
in the back he's a red Kool on the left
hand side which which tells you

268
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:04,049
basically whether you're looking at a
thumb mode operation or I or like a full

269
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:09,740
operation so you'll note that for both
of them to people about their actually

270
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:18,890
the same except Western Ontario you may
have to modified both and the arm mode

271
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:23,679
that's relatively rare soap opera checks
by going through the Machine Co

272
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,260
determine whether versus mode or thumb
and they're on the right hand side of

273
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:32,450
the screen is a section that cool in
karting and it actually just tells you

274
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:39,700
whether or not explains why some of the
machine code you see on the left hand

275
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:47,090
side is different because you got 30
tickets or four bytes and then married

276
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,090
62 bytes

277
00:32:54,279 --> 00:33:03,070
became more popular they started adding
more and more functionality to it so

278
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:09,119
that you could do more stuff even better
battery life basically so typically now

279
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:14,709
and will rarely go out of a difference
being dumped hopefully it will really go

280
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:20,159
out of some are calling stored procedure
executes instructions that are not

281
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:29,599
available tomorrow which I don't have a
list of that for you because so yeah

282
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:33,489
that's been or something if it does
branch elsewhere on the out sometimes it

283
00:33:33,489 --> 00:33:38,589
will have to jump out of out of the mode
as well so we can do now we can search

284
00:33:38,589 --> 00:33:49,440
for a move but what happens if the
application doesn't do what you wanted

285
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:57,019
to do ya thing so what you do is you
need to figure out the machine charge of

286
00:33:57,019 --> 00:34:00,559
these simple instruction which is
actually good place to start learning

287
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:04,440
machine charges when you're on the job
trying to do things right said just

288
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,700
arbitrarily reading thank you to you
must be getting heavy so it's just

289
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:10,879
drinking it

290
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:16,449
so so would you like to participate in
the cultural exchange because we've been

291
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:49,489
talking about some boards you for a
minute that no one says that I hear that

292
00:34:49,489 --> 00:35:12,808
but just pretend just pretend it tastes
better than it does

293
00:35:29,310 --> 00:36:05,690
Carolina all I like two weeks is bogus I
was desired the advocates for two weeks

294
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:19,590
where were you last year so what we're
doing now is what is the instruction all

295
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:22,210
the things that you want to do it
doesn't exist in the part of the

296
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:26,260
application is trying to modify what
that means is you need to go through the

297
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:31,020
machine card and then you need to set
some flags and that kind of crap so

298
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:37,540
you'll notice in the picture we've got
some most sets three consecutive months

299
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:42,120
he said they're all highlighted in a row
there for you and then they've got

300
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:48,279
destination register 2012 and then on
the left hand side of the screen of the

301
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:53,710
highlight of POD you gonna see some
consecutive as well now there's a

302
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:59,620
hexadecimal values and what we can do is
assume that they correspond surprise to

303
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:07,509
this thing on the same line as the
highlight it could really confusing if

304
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:14,700
not exists so now that we know that the
instruction wanna do we want to change

305
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:23,080
is the 0020 we can then assemble this
move instruction 40 and then return that

306
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:27,560
what we're doing here is yeah that's
that's actually

307
00:37:32,839 --> 00:37:40,799
now that we've done that we go to the
function that we want to change me right

308
00:37:40,799 --> 00:37:46,739
click and then we just press a simple
instructions now that we've done that

309
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:49,569
impressed next you end up with these
boxes on the left hand side of the

310
00:37:49,569 --> 00:38:00,180
screen and then you just type in that
mode and then the relevant hexadecimal

311
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:15,640
there's also an understanding here when
you fuck it all happened so when you

312
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:22,460
have to know about consecutive functions
in on and some don't forget to do that

313
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,420
otherwise it won't work

314
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:34,369
mentally I like to think if consecutive
functions is different to what he's

315
00:38:34,369 --> 00:38:41,479
doing on my iPod Nano operation it just
helps me not make as many mistakes maybe

316
00:38:41,479 --> 00:38:49,450
it'll help you or maybe so this mail
application when talking about had

317
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:56,279
validation which I just took it off so
now we've done that and we can see what

318
00:38:56,279 --> 00:38:57,259
happens

319
00:38:57,259 --> 00:39:05,299
it turned out not really changed
applications if you're on a bug bounty

320
00:39:05,299 --> 00:39:10,380
or something they've got these cracked
jokes and scientific opinion just spin

321
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:13,759
your wheels doing absolutely nothing to
you get rid of that stuff so that's how

322
00:39:13,759 --> 00:39:16,759
you get started

323
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:25,299
the other thing is that if you are
reversed at some point during this stage

324
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:35,210
of things and you come across a doorman
cyber pathogen don't don't touch it was

325
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:41,410
so tell me something could happen if

326
00:39:49,920 --> 00:40:08,240
noise

327
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:24,600
the relevant when you wanna do I go into
enduring Vegas good when you were not in

328
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:35,049
Vegas but if you just want to see what's
happening in japan unlike some chap out

329
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:44,290
or people who would like to do that they
they can do that now we're used to be

330
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:48,580
you know used to be really easy but they
keep talking awful is restrictions

331
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:54,350
stories keep coming out of like having
your social responsibility and getting

332
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:59,759
people in countries where you know a lot
about it so they actually starting to

333
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,760
try a little bit but the whole core
functionality of the product is flawed

334
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,609
in that regard so have a lot of success
but what you might do for example you

335
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:10,940
might search and hope you like we did on
the first slide when we talk to crack

336
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:14,700
you might just like location services
manager or something and then what you

337
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,240
can do all you have to do in like two or
three different locations in the app

338
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:22,790
depending on the model of your foreign
because there are multiple places doing

339
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,830
these checks and balances that's one of
the reasons why she like teleport

340
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:32,480
doesn't work anymore and then you know
you can just set and you let long done

341
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:42,200
so or in cases of applications like from
this screenshot of got here is that it

342
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,560
was just sending your location of Haiti
to be anyway so you don't even need to

343
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:51,230
like go to any trouble to mess with it
so that's nice but yeah what I found

344
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:55,250
during my time like try to do about is
what kind of crap with this kind of shit

345
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:58,380
is that if you are

346
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:05,880
trying to do something with like Twitter
for example twitter is a real and also

347
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:10,930
the app itself is really like like what
happens when you doing it is it has like

348
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:14,240
so many checks and balances and
obfuscation stuff in there that it's

349
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:26,810
really difficult to do job so you don't
start with a lot of banking apps to the

350
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:31,340
same like they won't even turn on until
you do you tend to associate if you if

351
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:36,660
you jailbreak it and a lot of this some
of the banking apps now as you do try

352
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:45,200
and turn them on jailbreak it sends like
back to back to HQ so she'd like your

353
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:50,960
device IDs account the you may be trying
to sign into and he bother crap which

354
00:43:50,960 --> 00:44:08,080
from from like it until around with
random bangkok's difficult to find you

355
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:12,910
may be to be Solaray who put a picture
of me wearing a dress on the screen for

356
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:16,660
far too long so thank you

357
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:24,480
the cultural change minds drive down the
dollar

358
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:59,009
only allowed a hundred and forty dollars
in your account

359
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:09,550
it would certainly make my life easier
to manage and they need hundred and

360
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:22,380
thirty-nine only need one hundred and
got left so let's let's let's are up

361
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:32,810
like 10 minutes left but he's not he's
just returning to a spot everyone do not

362
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:47,119
yet in some shit about this stuff on
Twitter account that's like mostly

363
00:45:47,119 --> 00:46:05,510
dormant referencing the guy in the
second row booking

364
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:19,740
nevermind up on his fiddling with a lock
nevermind sorry I'm sorry if I caused

365
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:26,069
you any intention so yeah if you doing
this man the other stuff you gonna be

366
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:30,570
looking at is like these three things on
the screen here probably the neatest

367
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:34,570
things you gonna let you gonna need if
you if you've never done this before you

368
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:38,349
need all the crap that I mentioned
already plus these three things and then

369
00:46:38,349 --> 00:46:49,190
you'll be well on your way to something
really exploring the most fences of iOS

370
00:46:49,190 --> 00:47:07,339
reverse engineering just makes you
sounds ok well I'll begin soon so I mean

371
00:47:07,339 --> 00:47:13,420
talking but I do have one final lesson
that's probably the most important one

372
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:17,420
actually lessons that's good

373
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:21,730
the first one is that when you drink the
whole bag of goon like it maybe my share

374
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:25,990
with a couple of people know what will
happen is it just a little hi David I

375
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:30,129
know you're on skype is when you drink
the whole bag and this is the best hack

376
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:34,720
on don't like to get election is you
blow the bag back up and use as a pillow

377
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:44,690
yeah yeah that's like telling lies tax
time

378
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:51,980
life hacks and the final lesson is when
you least Carolina con this you forget

379
00:47:51,980 --> 00:48:02,550
to buy some petrol gas I just got out to
the guy in this picture I only know his

380
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:06,230
name but he's handled so I should not
revealed that shot out to him he's

381
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:08,830
sitting on the back there

382
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:16,279
down to you my friend I will IC for
everyone I petrol had some June cultural

383
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,030
exchange

384
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:22,030
time

385
00:48:26,309 --> 00:48:34,229
yeah we have time to this joy my culture

386
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:22,210
but I don't drive on the other side of
the road to what I told him that we

387
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:31,380
drive on the other side of the road he
said so that's all for now thank you

388
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:39,860
Dental Services and gentle she was I
hope that wasn't too dry

389
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:41,540
this is my first time doing something
like this
