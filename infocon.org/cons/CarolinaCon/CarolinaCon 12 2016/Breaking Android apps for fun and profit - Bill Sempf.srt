1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,799
up to you know I'm here hi my name is
Bill Sam I'm the one o'clock talk you're

2
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:13,340
all gonna have carved home in about 30
minutes and be asleep but that's ok so

3
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:20,250
I'm from Columbus don't hold it against
me pleasure to be here and try to get

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,460
here for four years really nice to talk
to you all I am a programmer how many

5
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,960
people here are programs for a living
the checkout code morning checking in at

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,910
night wow good fantastic people here
mobile developers one person that's even

7
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,819
better you might actually find this talk
interesting that fantastic so what we're

8
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,090
about today

9
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:47,489
well they'd like that sound board over
there you know you know deejay scratch

10
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:52,190
thing one of the turntable is it alright
so I'm doing something you can find me

11
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,190
absent on Twitter if you're interested
that was freaky

12
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:04,420
by trade I have the security guy on the
developer team for about 15 years I did

13
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,950
my first application vulnerability
analysis run in 2002 before there any

14
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:14,850
tools I use like effects coffin and and
when debugging weird things like that so

15
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:20,699
it's it's it's been a fun ride for a
long time but for the last year from a

16
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,470
web guy primarily let's be straight
about you some rich guy I've been an

17
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,500
Internet person since before there was a
web so how many people here no go for

18
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:36,310
script fantastic ok I also know go for
script that's how old I am so now you

19
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:42,040
know for certain but in the last year
I've been asked to do

20
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,200
application vulnerability analysis on
Android applications which has been

21
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,610
quite an interesting little trip for me
not being a native mobile developer I'm

22
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:58,320
used to a web server generating HTML is
rendered by browser not a a mid the

23
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,389
thick client application on the device
that just speaking of your services so

24
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,840
it's been it's been an education process
for me and I thought this would be a

25
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,750
fantastic time to drop like

26
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,040
all the tools that I've been using an
and the knowledge just kind of in one

27
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,769
place all the stuff that makes it
possible for me to do the tests were not

28
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,130
going to decompile anything that's not
true we are going to decompile couple

29
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,079
things but we're not gonna drop any Leo
days are breaking into order do anything

30
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,950
super super fancy here I'm just a troll
you the tools that I've been using and

31
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:34,310
how to use them in the little camera
shots of getting them working to do

32
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:39,320
wonderful analysis the real quick what
is their ability announces vulnerability

33
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,320
now this is like 10 testing but it's not
the same

34
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:49,910
testers generally speaking are given a
goal and have to do whatever is within

35
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:55,430
the scope to get to that goal so you
know get admin access on my servers are

36
00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:00,380
getting domain access admin privileges
or or get mad at the password file and

37
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:05,100
then write a report to explain how you
did it so their job is requires a very

38
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,180
wide breadth of knowledge lots of
different things

39
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,030
application portability analysts however
are given one application are asked to

40
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:18,140
find every problem with it could be a
security concern though it's like really

41
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:23,130
really fancy QA basically in QA you got
a test plan you worked as planned and

42
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:28,200
vulnerability analysis we know all
potential vulnerabilities for

43
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,640
applications application vulnerability
application security rather assault

44
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,730
problem we know what's out there we just
need to accurately check for it which is

45
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:44,010
requires a fair amount of knowledge of
development and also what the

46
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,970
vulnerabilities are and then a
smattering of knowledge of general

47
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:50,880
operating system security and network
security like that that's what

48
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:58,209
application portability analysts do so I
mentioned that this is a solved problem

49
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:06,090
and it is so there is a group called oh
but the open web application security

50
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:13,079
project and that group is all about
distributing information about

51
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:17,750
application security specifically web
application security but they venture

52
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,930
into mobile because mobile is not
terribly unlike web

53
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:26,250
because if it's service-oriented nature
so one of the projects that I asked us

54
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,110
to help bring visibility to application
vulnerability are obviously security

55
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:35,280
router is the top 10 list you probably
all heard of the OWASP top 10 which is

56
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,888
gathered from some 35,000 vulnerability
analysis over a three-year span they

57
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:45,990
judge how many different how many
different instances of each portability

58
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:49,199
and found what the risks were and then
put them in order by what's most

59
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,400
important what's the least important not
everyone but he just the top ten just to

60
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,060
bring visibility well you can't revisit
that can read it to you this is

61
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:02,650
relatively new it's the mobile top tech
to this is the same thing done to mobile

62
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:07,448
applications and that's where I started
at all this like I need to test for

63
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:12,320
these things but there's no good rules
for testing for this I needed to rate

64
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,919
some of them so we've got things like em
one that the number 12 bility they

65
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,859
discovered as improper platform usage
which is not a big surprise of any of

66
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,590
you here are penned testers are voting
for durability analysts you probably

67
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:31,239
discovering that if you test like a.net
application the number one problem is

68
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,750
caused by improperly using the.net
framework security features turning off

69
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:43,360
the bank cross-site scripting protection
for instance or not properly using the

70
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,470
cross-site request forgery

71
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:51,330
well the same thing is true and Android
iOS and and Blackberry and Windows Phone

72
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:56,539
applications people improperly used the
platform so that's something we need to

73
00:05:56,539 --> 00:06:00,590
do we need to know enough about the
platform to check and see if they're

74
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,409
using it right and that's not the
easiest thing in the world and frankly

75
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:09,479
even though its number one here it's
probably my personal weakest peace I'm

76
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:13,940
not an android dev natively get into
that a little bit later on how to help

77
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:14,509
you

78
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:19,070
m2 in secure data storage this is by far
the biggest one that I found people

79
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,479
putting stuff in places they think is
secure but it's not

80
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:27,960
m3 isn't secure communications right
calling service here but not using TLS

81
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,440
or still using SSL v3 which is commonly
known to be broken

82
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:37,040
those those kinds of problems especially
in banking applications are a very big

83
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,780
deal

84
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:43,020
m4 is in secure authentication so this
is failing to verify that the user

85
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:48,349
authenticated in every screen and the
application not realizing that users can

86
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:52,110
move from screen to screen freely if
they know exactly what they're doing

87
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:58,710
that just one example session management
week this week this is a general m5 is

88
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:04,659
insufficient cryptography so these root
out from in secure communication because

89
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,440
there's a lot of encryption of data at
rest there's also a lot of confusion

90
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,630
just like we find everywhere else in
that application space between

91
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:19,170
encryption and encoding developers think
that encoding something with 364 any

92
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:23,630
other encoding is sufficient to prevent
that attacker from after modifying the

93
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,110
information when in fact that is not the
case at all

94
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,270
misunderstanding what I hashes for
things like that

95
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:36,850
insecure authorization as m6 so not
checking to see if a user has access to

96
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:40,440
a given method in the underlying API
because they can't get to it from you I

97
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,260
so it must be ok right and what will
talk about that little bit more later

98
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:48,969
client code quality which is a very big
issue

99
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,900
mobile applications are often but felt
underdressed like so many applications

100
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:59,690
and making Piran simple off by one
coding errors in in in application is

101
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:07,730
really really common code pampering so
feeling is the negative the reverse

102
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,240
principal

103
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:16,070
failing to protect yourself from the
ability of a developer to patch and read

104
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:21,080
deploy an application which you can do
in order to change the functionality of

105
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,620
the application reverse engineering
which is the ability to figure out how

106
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,890
the application works by looking at the
source code you can do and then

107
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,930
extraneous functionality adding and
stuff that isn't actually needed by the

108
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:35,650
application then not putting any UI in
thinking that the user we'll never find

109
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:40,530
it when really you can so that the
mobile top 10 they'll just as an aside

110
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,140
if you're interested in mobile security

111
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:48,730
this is the 2016 listed it in beta so if
you're interested in getting involved in

112
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:54,440
some open source documentation work is
looking for some feedback on this if you

113
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:00,310
go to Austin Argo wasup dot org and
click on the mobile top 10 project you

114
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:05,939
can go in to vote in give your opinion
on these items and whether you think

115
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:14,090
they're the top 10 security concerns for
mobile that's where I started the next

116
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:19,180
thing to do is actually start to dig
into the application's itself and this

117
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,770
isn't very this is this is my list of
all the stuff I'm gonna do so don't

118
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:30,730
sweat this list too much so the first
thing I I wanted to do was run a hundred

119
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:35,550
stimulator because of the development
world running on devices is a pain in

120
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:40,290
the butt but we try to do it instead we
try to run in some kind of emulator

121
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:49,160
simulator in a way I can make make me
cringe when I can make multiple copies I

122
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,930
can make make make shadow copies and
then revert to the state fifteen minutes

123
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:58,010
ago if I screw up machine that's what I
wanted to be able to do so I discovered

124
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:01,939
this application called Jenny motion
motion is written by a bunch Swedish

125
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:13,480
developers and it is a a rapper over
VirtualBox that specifically handles

126
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:22,720
Android emulation it is probably ten
times faster than the development kit

127
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,710
that comes with an injury which will
talk about it later on we talk about PC

128
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:32,150
stuff if you are going to do this go get
Jenny motion you can use it for free

129
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:36,790
it's one of those free for personal use
things and there's no way for them to

130
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:40,540
check of course I did pay for the
license because the software is that

131
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:44,740
good when you write software for live
you tend to pay for things cause I want

132
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,290
people to pay for my software so you
know I pay for other people software

133
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:53,069
that's why it is so this is a licensed
addition a little if you're going to do

134
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,460
this yourself at home tonight

135
00:10:54,460 --> 00:11:00,410
little different than yours though you
can go and create a virtual device in

136
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:06,209
any one of the Android versions that
emulates an actual machine is a Google

137
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:11,870
Nexus 9 the tablet HTC devices Samsung
they've got all these pre-built

138
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:20,750
pre-built ron is out there and this is
already running so I didn't need to

139
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:28,490
start it and here you are so now we have
a a full-fledged Android application

140
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:31,910
right here now because I've got a touch
screen I can actually go in and run it

141
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:38,709
like a touch screen and it's it's very
any dust off at home I'm obviously

142
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,930
Windows user

143
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:45,319
home I have one of my monitors as a
touch screen so I can I can easily get

144
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,480
by and and and run through applications
so I will mention to you if you do this

145
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:59,250
I highly recommend you set up a separate
gmail account to login with make a fake

146
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:06,620
account and let that be your your test
accounts if you can go in make a

147
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,550
facebook with it and on and on and on
LinkedIn and Twitter and you can also

148
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:15,219
use it for some social engineering stuff
which is awesome dual use but you will

149
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,900
find this particular instance I did not
realize this when I started setting up

150
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:25,510
the demo this one is actually linked to
my regular business account my physical

151
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:31,470
phone isn't but I'm studying and working
in my google chat messages from my wife

152
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:36,930
started popping up on the testimony that
stuff so so don't do don't make that

153
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:42,109
mistake also if you do something
particularly extraneous in your

154
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,470
in an application that touches the
actual Google account

155
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,860
attacks to you don't want to destroy her
personal information

156
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:55,200
so please take it to do that and I'll
show you mine when we moved to the

157
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,200
physical phone here I have time

158
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:06,050
so what we need to do doubt the most
important thing we need to do up front

159
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:12,300
is we need to look at the communication
between this enduring device and its

160
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:17,359
server wherever it happens beyond the
internet that's the most important thing

161
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,140
we need to do up front

162
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,980
it'll let us know what data is being
transferred over the wire and how if

163
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,620
you've ever done web application
vulnerability analysis this is exactly

164
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:36,880
the same thing the web browser is now
that Jenny motion ok so we better and we

165
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:43,030
need to run perhaps week how many people
here know what words we did okay that's

166
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:49,540
what I thought so sweet is an attack
proxy it's it's just like a normal proxy

167
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:55,709
between one machine and another machine
and lets you watch the traffic or modify

168
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,850
ok in this case it sits between the

169
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:09,940
that we have running and whatever server
happens to be talking to so the way it

170
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:15,260
works is we have two sets of proxy list
obviously does all-in-one machine but

171
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,700
pretending your mind from its all
separate machines there's a server in

172
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:23,230
the cloud somewhere that's easy to
forget about there's a VMware pretend

173
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:27,460
like it's pretend like this device is
actually a phone for a while to separate

174
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:33,400
thing this computer is sitting in
between those two computers listening to

175
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:39,770
what we're gonna do is reduce set up a
proxy solicitor will accept any IP

176
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:48,760
number coming in and has a port number
and then we're going to go to your phone

177
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,790
web service

178
00:14:55,270 --> 00:15:08,670
and we are going to go to our connection
which Jen emotional automatically comes

179
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:12,740
for free we're gonna modify it and we're
gonna put in the IP number of this

180
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:19,770
machine port 80 90 ok we also need to
trust birth certificate which requires

181
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:23,880
downloading the certificate in importing
an Android you can look up how to do if

182
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:33,380
you wanna do that then if we were to run
an application like say for instance we

183
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:42,080
go here and we find insecure bank one of
my favorite bangs right and we going to

184
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:50,280
see login there's the post the log in
now there'll be no response to that I

185
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,650
have the service that is right actually
gonna break in applications this is just

186
00:15:53,650 --> 00:16:00,370
gonna get tools you'll notice of other
stuff here this is an Android phone at

187
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:06,960
home every application on this device is
using port 80 or port 443 to communicate

188
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:11,170
back that's just how everything talks
now it is possible

189
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,900
you're gonna get an application that
makes a binary pipe to some weird

190
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:19,020
service and you're not gonna be able to
see it was very unlikely but possible

191
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:26,190
pretty much everything is going to
communicate with 80 or 443 and we're

192
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:29,980
gonna be able to watch it so what we
only want to see our stuff where you can

193
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:35,310
right click and save add this particular
application scope things go here in the

194
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:39,219
filter parameters realize that small
sorry only lets you make it so big so

195
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:44,980
you'll have to trust me on this ABC show
only in scope items and it shows only

196
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:50,490
those two requests that we've made from
this particular instance and that's how

197
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:56,180
we scoped out the tests were doing for a
specific piece so to give you an idea

198
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,829
what this looks like if we get a more
interesting application let's see if we

199
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:06,579
can go and get a happier news but akron
is trying to tell her

200
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:19,049
a fresh view that can you call Darara by
Ramy right and then here is her news

201
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:24,750
here's the request just to get for /
News Bears response the responses coming

202
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:29,919
back and Jason format so this is where
you're going to find most of your

203
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,510
interesting stuff

204
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:35,610
developers are used to calling services
that were developed for other things

205
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:41,080
things that our web server with managed
so that they can take the web server

206
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:46,730
they can teach it to handle the Jason
feed Monday up short in HTML and then

207
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:53,010
send it over the internet here however
we can see the actual Jason feel we can

208
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:58,320
see the original data it's extremely
likely the David that the developer did

209
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,820
not intend to go over the wire is gonna
shopping here because the last time they

210
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:08,139
couldn't against is in 2010 for their
web application it was all handled in

211
00:18:08,139 --> 00:18:13,979
their DMZ this Jason never been outside
their network ok this is the first place

212
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:20,779
we look for information that's of
interest to us all right there any

213
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:23,779
questions on networking stuff

214
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:39,420
absolutely so the question was when I
mention that we needed a certain that

215
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,930
because it's doing a man in the middle
of that is absolutely actual absolutely

216
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:47,950
correct and you can if you're in a web
browser just a trusted certificate once

217
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:53,390
and it will forever but in Android it
will ask you on every service call and

218
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:59,040
it's up so I don't do it you just import
to start instead now if you import the

219
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:04,810
birth cert that means that device is
compromised for armor you remove the

220
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,230
third while and trust that sir you
cannot use it to do normal traffic

221
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:12,710
another reason to have a fake account so
please do not do this on your regular

222
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:17,770
phone ok because there are doctors out
there that use the birth cert to do in

223
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:25,690
the middle for phishing attacks and
whatnot so please don't do that so

224
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:32,600
sometimes work gets confused about data
calls if that's the keys just use

225
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,850
another proxy their money out there that
attack proxy is an awesome project is

226
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:41,169
free it is wonderful it is also written
in Java

227
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:47,010
it it will do everything group does
there are some special attack tools the

228
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:51,850
bird houses are extremely powerful than
half because Burke has a staff and

229
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:57,209
that's $400 a year and there's hundreds
of thousands of people using it so they

230
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:01,460
have a budget that is wonderful

231
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:08,610
yeah it's gonna blow this is that that
is an open source project is 243

232
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:12,679
commuters the head of it as a No asked
but member in in project leader shimon

233
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:17,960
bennett's on he was employed by Mozilla
to work full time on Sat so it's it's

234
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,130
awesome and it does some things very
well one of the things it does well is

235
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:25,570
it doesn't get confused about traffic
whereas work done it's almost got too

236
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:29,210
many features so if you hadn't happened
you can't see the communication with the

237
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:37,600
server try another project so once you
have the services up themselves you

238
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,600
might want to

239
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:46,840
actually build a test suite for the
services if you do so strongly recommend

240
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,309
soapUI has an open source version and I
just realized it's probably gonna show

241
00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:58,180
up a really really tiny cuz i havent
tweak the settings for this message that

242
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:02,680
didn't think about that at the time you
just have to trust me I can't even read

243
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:10,460
that I'm sitting in front of soap UI is
a QA 2004 web services it's called

244
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:15,630
soapUI because when it was written back
in 2004 whatever so was all there was

245
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:19,920
now a very handily Hills rest so you can
do things like putting to rest ten

246
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,100
points it will make reference call to
the rest any point and set up a test

247
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:30,559
suite for you then you can proxies
soaked through birth exercise the API

248
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,809
outside the enduring application and
find all the flaws

249
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:41,440
the entered using entered a plea to show
you a very powerful tool that way so

250
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,440
that's just a little aside there for
that year

251
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:51,949
ok so in order to be effective and
tester it helps to be an effective

252
00:21:51,950 --> 00:22:01,200
Android developer so if you haven't yet
but strop you strongly recommend you go

253
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,940
and download android studio from Google
it is free there are tons of sample

254
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:11,210
applications build the sample app and
loaded on your test your Jenny motion

255
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:14,100
test bone and watch it work

256
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:22,120
you can set up free services on Azure or
on a tip yes or on Heroku and have the

257
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,178
communication take place and you can you
can trial this result in the see what

258
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:28,990
the developers faced with other
configuration options

259
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:35,200
strongly recommend you that it is it is
free and easy to use the underlying

260
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,390
development languages Java Java is not
hard it's not Python but it's not hard

261
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:48,179
and you can do some very very cool stuff
with it so that's one reason I'm very

262
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:48,570
proud

263
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:57,740
so

264
00:23:01,399 --> 00:23:07,428
process wearing the structure of Android
application will help you alot when you

265
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:14,620
get to actually be compiling the apk
which will get into a minute done it

266
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:23,090
slow this is what I was talking about
maybe a pop up eventually we'll keep

267
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:33,389
working for a little while we're talking
about here so once you have

268
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:57,280
you have your body motion of Yemen
running you can use the built-in command

269
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:02,700
line tools to connect with Jenny motion
wrongs are routed by default you have

270
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:08,549
complete control of the Android phone as
a Linux box which is what it is under

271
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:14,309
the covers right so you can use ATB ATB
is super easy to use

272
00:24:14,309 --> 00:24:20,740
you can just downloaded from Google put
it in your C Drive and it's only for

273
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:29,500
like that for file super easy out here
pass this works in Linux too I i didnt i

274
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,820
didnt mention this before I'm gonna back
up for a second say the first thing I

275
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:38,658
did before any of this so quickly to the
back of the top talk the first thing I

276
00:24:38,659 --> 00:24:42,700
did this start all this under Linux
cause I thought Android Linux makes

277
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,419
sense that I've got a machine just like
them or not just like this but I have a

278
00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:51,480
machine with a touch screen that's Linux
and and it's my main test machine when

279
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:57,320
testing applications and I started this
process of building out this this test

280
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:02,389
lab rendering it was a disaster there
aren't any tools there aren't any

281
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:08,350
they're just there isn't anything that
runs on Linux all of this is based on

282
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:14,899
what moderate use to do routing and and
modification in thinning of applications

283
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:20,470
and all of them are 14 years old and the
only use Windows you ask but I'm not

284
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:26,360
kidding it's true they're using mom's
old Windows laptop to do this work and

285
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:31,309
this doctor the right is all Windows
software and read studio does it run on

286
00:25:31,309 --> 00:25:36,770
Linux for crap ATB works kind of the
other two of them to show you their art

287
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:42,970
Linux vs so if you're a Mac user or a
Linux user I recommend doing all this on

288
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:47,340
Windows and what's more it can be a
Windows p.m. because Jenny motion has to

289
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:53,629
run on the metal so it's it's a Windows
world and I don't know I mean for this

290
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:59,030
day I don't know why but it is I'm not a
Windows teen boy but it was I tried it

291
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,940
both ways and this was the easiest so

292
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:06,860
busy bee Sweden CDB devices and a lack
of response attacks that's our internet

293
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:12,590
location or interact with him so he is
very powerful it has lots of cool

294
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:19,750
features as you can see there's all
kinds think you can move files back and

295
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:25,170
forth all kinds of networking to push
that moves the files back and forth

296
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:30,780
devices you can connect and disconnect
VIP but the thing you're gonna find used

297
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,500
most of all

298
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:44,190
lips done that Obama's push poll and
skin shell now we want to that energy

299
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:56,270
and that that's it I don't know

300
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:33,530
ok so there is the subject of an
arrestee carnival right done fantastic

301
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:43,050
talk about yes so it comes pre connected
to Jenny motion p.m. will already be

302
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:49,379
connected to a TV you won't have to
touch it honestly I'm not sure why that

303
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:53,690
happens I haven't figured it out yet but
it's true you just happen to be a minute

304
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:57,180
in a deal to find it like that you don't
have to do any character is honestly

305
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:00,510
connect sometimes a little jakey it's
it's it's hard to figure out what's

306
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,210
going on

307
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:07,990
specially if you have an unusual
situation and what not yet so it's just

308
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,360
a Linux box right

309
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,020
frankly probably most of the people in
this room know more about stuff you can

310
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,260
find in here that I do but let me show
you one thing

311
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:34,149
day data is where everything is gonna
save its settings so you get you install

312
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:46,650
the app you go to dinner and then you
well its shell UAT bball you know as the

313
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:54,809
OS X sorry

314
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:04,229
and you remember the last Florence
trailing slash their the file there was

315
00:29:04,229 --> 00:29:08,509
the shortest one how do I grabbed it and
then you get an idea of what the

316
00:29:08,509 --> 00:29:12,489
settings are on install then you
exercise the application on the phone

317
00:29:12,489 --> 00:29:25,679
and do it again and compare them yes
that's what we've done that would make

318
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,820
it easy for you to do yes if you want to
do it manually that's why but Jenny

319
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:33,960
motion has the Brahms presets so that
with the question was for the reporting

320
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,849
on this will work with any wrong you
have downloaded yes if you want you

321
00:29:37,849 --> 00:29:43,239
actually take an image of a real phone
and you could you can set up the VMN it

322
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:52,639
would work the same exact way yes no I
don't know that I am NOT next for this

323
00:29:52,639 --> 00:29:57,619
is just this is in fact if afterwards
when we're done if I'm completely wrong

324
00:29:57,619 --> 00:30:00,029
here and you have a much easier way to
do something feel free to come up her

325
00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:04,169
yelling out at the end and and tell me
where I got something wrong

326
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:07,460
this this was this is literally just my
original research and nothing else

327
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,659
nothing more

328
00:30:08,659 --> 00:30:14,619
beginning of that so that we want to do
we get we get along and we shall we can

329
00:30:14,619 --> 00:30:17,619
look around in the ass weekend

330
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:43,560
weekend so we can go looking for
instance we can say cd2 arts crafts and

331
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:47,620
I was that we had a local press on XML
think there might be something

332
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,179
interesting in there now in this
particular application there is no I

333
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:55,850
didn't want to go break into anything
because that's just rude I actually if

334
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:59,969
you are bored one day in your career but
Windows security I didn't talk at Black

335
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:03,080
Hat Europe 2011

336
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:08,180
about Windows 8 security when does he
was breaking news before it before it

337
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:14,030
drops 04 2011 I don't remember but it's
on YouTube somewhere and i actually

338
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:19,840
showed like security flaws in the
Windows 8 Store apps because they're

339
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,020
JavaScript you can just go look at them
and actually got a phone call from

340
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:28,030
Microsoft so I'm not doing that again
we're just gonna talk about tools today

341
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:35,730
because Microsoft was nice I don't think
Google really so we can do you know what

342
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:38,950
I got interesting in there right now but
there might be something after we

343
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:42,350
exercise the Apple Isle right and that's
what you want to do you want to install

344
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:46,620
the application get night to take a
snapshot of its data profile exercise

345
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:50,179
the application to another snapshot
compare the two find out what changes

346
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:55,820
about urs now sometimes applications
have ability to look at things in other

347
00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:00,689
places the Android OS you have to go
elsewhere in the Android OS two look and

348
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:05,810
we'll look at that we talked about the
compiler here in just a second copy the

349
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:12,770
hostess should do that with a deep pool
so I will show you this when I get to

350
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:15,770
this phone but there is a tool called

351
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:24,710
actor and you can actually go and get
the DVD file which andrea is not likely

352
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:31,820
to do my fault but because it's a rooted
phone you have more control structure

353
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:41,530
actually get the apt for you you can ADB
pull the apk file EBK and downloaded to

354
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:46,918
your local machine and then look at it
so this is where we have well let's

355
00:32:46,919 --> 00:33:02,410
let's let's look at the script so ok so
once you have the apk can do things like

356
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:04,429
run scanners on it now

357
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:09,049
LinkedIn wrote a scanner that they then
opened stores called Clark Fork

358
00:33:09,049 --> 00:33:11,510
I don't know what it's called I never
said that while before I don't think

359
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,879
what's this

360
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:20,620
whatever it says there but it's a
scanner and it's written in Python it's

361
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,620
stupid easy to use

362
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,770
that's good you know everybody's
favorite program language Python

363
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:37,519
it's all menu driven to say who hears
you set the social engineering toolkit

364
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:38,769
awesome

365
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:43,409
rocks he is not a programmer though his

366
00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:54,499
the app works created your look at the
code hold my god we do not do not use

367
00:33:54,499 --> 00:34:01,360
that as a as an example for how to
architect architect that iPhone apps so

368
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:09,868
you can just go in here and say I want I
want a baby came to provide a path and

369
00:34:09,869 --> 00:34:20,669
then I'm gonna remember where that path
is so many things are proud about this

370
00:34:20,668 --> 00:34:25,408
year's

371
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,780
well you might think I work for it but
we're we're running a mile away

372
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:49,969
okay so anyway this is just it's a
scanner to code scanner right it's going

373
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:54,589
to look for common flaws and Android
applications for you and it's it's

374
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:59,070
blindingly easy to use and I have a I
have a apk on here somewhere to test it

375
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:05,300
with but we're a little slow anyway so
we won't will play with right now and it

376
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:10,040
just gives you the HTML report you can
like throwing your evidence folders

377
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,520
fantastic

378
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,780
military and linking people wrote it and
even though it's credible company the

379
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:21,080
security guys are super nice and I one
of them is in Columbus lock sport and

380
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:25,880
he's awesome he pointed me to this
highly recommended the iOS tool not so

381
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,640
wonderful

382
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:33,700
the Android tool two thumbs up so you
can do that so what else can we do you

383
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:38,569
know how many days later so I'll just
leave it right so we have the apk what

384
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,240
else can we do

385
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:47,939
well there's a couple things you can do
so here's our apk as it turns out an apk

386
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:54,020
is just a zip folder change the
directory to change their policy expand

387
00:35:54,020 --> 00:36:00,670
it and there's now some of its compiled
some of its a binary some of its hard to

388
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:05,280
read some of it isn't but it'll give you
something to sit and poke app which is

389
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:11,100
also there are tools out there that will
help you or her certain pieces of this

390
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:15,799
look at things you may have the apology
grown that would work that stuff some of

391
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:20,160
them are just text for instance this is
the manifest this is all of the things

392
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:26,210
that the application uses the list of
pieces of of the Android OS that it

393
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:32,660
pulls in for use very interesting
information it will also teach you what

394
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:39,980
features of the Android OS what what is
not allowed to use so that's very useful

395
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:45,780
because it has access to special
environment within the Android OS or

396
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:49,870
special directories or whatever all
better being here so that's very

397
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:53,089
interesting information but

398
00:36:53,090 --> 00:37:01,430
there is even a better way to do this
and that is why isn't on the list here

399
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:18,399
it is this is virtuous ten this is an
example of why using Windows is better

400
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,140
for this kind of testing done using
Linux even though it extends far

401
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:25,859
superior form of security testing for
this kind of our ability now since

402
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:30,580
virtually stan is one of these pieces of
software written by some kid initially

403
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:37,360
more to do modding beaming of Android
applications it is extremely rich and

404
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:43,740
powerful and it does full D compilation
all the way back to the Java of an apk

405
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:50,600
even if it's been obligated however it
is a pain in the butt to configure in

406
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:56,730
between last week and this weekend while
I was on vacation for that week a Java

407
00:37:56,730 --> 00:38:02,280
update came through for this machine and
thought I'd try if I try to run this

408
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:07,220
project blows up and I could not get it
fixed between what I got back yesterday

409
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:11,009
afternoon in today so I can show you how
awesome this offer is in a very sorry

410
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:14,450
but but go get it

411
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:20,049
virtual virtuous ten studio go get it
installed it worked through the config

412
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:25,050
and then take a power nap you can quite
literally changed the way the app works

413
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:29,360
change through small file that our
underlying the basis of the application

414
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:34,740
the way it interacts with genes with the
app works patch it and put it back on

415
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:39,899
the device is rooted and run at the way
you want it to be wrong to think about

416
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,450
that if you work in the security field
in your developers are writing

417
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:46,830
applications out there saying we'll know
I've got the app configured so it can't

418
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:53,270
do that remember that attacker can
change the way the app works very very

419
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:58,259
key and this is the tool used to do it
and I'm sorry can't do it because I

420
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:09,020
really so there is that ok so once we
have it downloaded where we look for

421
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:16,740
what there is a list of the heck is it
going to be interesting

422
00:39:55,730 --> 00:40:06,480
so I don't have the final for some
reason it used to be here I must get rid

423
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:15,880
of it anyway there are in the Iowa in
the mobile testing piece that I

424
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,830
mentioned earlier that has the top 10
there is a collection of features that

425
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:29,890
you can wear collection of common bugs
you can look for weight I know where to

426
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:36,040
find it in just a minute I'm gonna move
to PC screen only for just a second as

427
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,080
it's going to get her life she okay I
promise I'll be right back

428
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:48,420
exactly where to go from one moment
please and we'll get back

429
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:59,850
here look at me

430
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:13,399
iraq that he knew he did this out there
sound ok for formatting

431
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:35,240
I mention that vulnerability analysis is
a lot like a like you a work and it is

432
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:42,348
and you have to have a test plan and so
I have a test plan I'm gonna put all

433
00:41:42,349 --> 00:41:46,119
this up on my blog at some point out
that next week sometime so you can you

434
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:50,280
can take a look at it but once you have
the source code in virtuous ten are

435
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:54,780
using apk to over there is if you search
for Android the compilation there

436
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:59,059
there's a billion tools out there Virtua
Tennis just the best one once you have

437
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:04,339
it with you have extracted you can go
and look for specific things with look

438
00:42:04,339 --> 00:42:07,339
at the property files

439
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:23,089
keywords you can search for a man you
know is there sdcard towards their stuff

440
00:42:23,089 --> 00:42:26,140
that you would hear is there something
in the manifest operate external storage

441
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:31,038
room right mention that have access to
do certain things within the Android OS

442
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:36,240
things you need to look for before the
but intact right this is just like

443
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:41,490
clickjacking of your pieces look for
JavaScript interfaces right look for

444
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:45,919
comments just like you would in a web
application all of these pieces this is

445
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,869
just a test plan that we're gonna work
through once we have access to the

446
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:54,799
underlying source code so there's a lot
we can do we've got that we can watch

447
00:42:54,799 --> 00:42:58,759
the communication with the server and we
can look at the actual code of the

448
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:03,670
application and and make decisions about
that so I mean really the only thing we

449
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:07,529
don't have it what's happening between
the service here in the database while

450
00:43:07,529 --> 00:43:11,849
most you can get into that machine which
hopefully you can't we have a right of

451
00:43:11,849 --> 00:43:14,210
access to its very easy to go on

452
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:18,279
find the problems that are out there
it's just a tools to get the job done

453
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:35,020
yeah because they compiled mode and the
comment stay at the question was where

454
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:40,590
the comment still there I would get rid
of them and there's something like

455
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:51,380
fourteen percent of the apps in the
store still so yeah I'm gonna save this

456
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:54,380
later

457
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:06,580
where are we now ok so the last thing
there might be a case where you would

458
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:14,840
want you need to run on the metal ok
specifically if you have an application

459
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:24,650
that uses Bluetooth or the camera or any
other hardware aspect of the phone

460
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:34,730
Jenny motion can technically emulate
those but it sucks like real bad so

461
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:39,650
don't even try if it's just a straight
you know dat in dat out application you

462
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:45,050
can read it later if he uses Bluetooth
of the camera or requires a chip or or

463
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:50,400
anything like that like a ship or
anything like that uses the SIM card for

464
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,050
instance you're gonna

465
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:57,720
so the best thing for you to do if you
if your gonna do this if you have a

466
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:04,980
couple bucks is go buy a 1+1 21 +
Chinese phone manufacturer that is

467
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:13,080
making you know flagship mobile phones
equivalent to the Nexus devices for half

468
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:18,799
the price cuz they're not being stupid I
mean the Android prices are getting

469
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:24,000
jacked up because Apple is now a fashion
company and so you're paying twelve you

470
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,830
go by the latest Samsung whatever blah
blah you're paying twice about twice

471
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:35,340
what the act of nature worth 1000 doing
that so this case for second seasons for

472
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:37,970
those of you who are caused by swine

473
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:43,839
it's it's it's it's a very very nice
tone it comes with Fran engine by

474
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:50,440
default and one Plus provides the route
wrong if you want to read it what you

475
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:54,030
will have to do I'm not gonna talk about
reading in this talk if you can't look

476
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:58,080
up the reading stuff then then new
Google pushups for a couple hours and

477
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:10,450
you'll be okay so what you do is this is
the phone you put your fake account on

478
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:19,009
well you should do it your p.m. to this
is so this is my fake account so back

479
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:23,099
how many people remember when gmail
first watched and you had to have an

480
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:24,930
invitation to get a gmail account

481
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:34,040
ok so I was like 1200 person to get an
invitation I got solution @ gmail.com

482
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:46,900
do you have any idea how many people use
that what I broke it anyway you have any

483
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:50,359
idea how many people use that account by
accident

484
00:46:50,359 --> 00:46:54,589
to sign up for things like Facebook
LinkedIn and Twitter well at least one

485
00:46:54,589 --> 00:46:59,990
so I have over time collected these
Gmail Facebook Twitter all these other

486
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:04,700
social networking accounts that have
access to so I have fully populated

487
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:11,049
accounts all the social networking stuff
from some guy in in Ghana and I really

488
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:13,990
broke this somehow this is not cool at
all

489
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:18,569
network connection you've got your phone
outright you like what you gotta listen

490
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:29,030
to me an offer enough to get back up and
running and connected to talk about this

491
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:33,950
so once you get this done you want to
get a one-plus and install Cali net

492
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:40,270
horner ok it is a Cali wrong for your
phone installs right on top of saying it

493
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:43,400
will not replace all your stuff and
you're already rooted remember when you

494
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,630
root the phone you will clean it so
rooted first then set up your counsel

495
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:48,580
for you have to set up

496
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:53,040
alright install carrying it harder and
it comes with all these awesome tools

497
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,040
which I would show you if my thing would
work

498
00:47:56,590 --> 00:48:12,990
ya hear my cable I guess so

499
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:17,750
900 comes with a whole hold it anymore
you can't see it it comes to a whole

500
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:22,060
comes the whole host of tools that are
offered using the device as a pen

501
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:27,090
testing device so you can attach the
wireless network to that end map it's

502
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:32,010
really very powerful but it has a whole
host of features to help you look at the

503
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:37,550
apt themselves like file managers that
have root privileges so if you want to

504
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:41,540
look at stuff on the phone as it
happening you can rather than having

505
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:47,600
hughes et be on a workstation very very
handy that so I would recommend using

506
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:51,759
both having both of physical device and
the virtual device both set up with your

507
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:57,850
test gmail account and all ready to go
there what did I forget the talk about

508
00:48:57,850 --> 00:49:11,930
here right yeah so set of local proxy
you can run it through work with the

509
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:16,230
local proxy just like we did with DVM
file manager at how to talk about that

510
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:21,370
the apk a tractor I mentioned earlier
and yeah i think i think thats about it

511
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:25,850
so that's those are the tools that I'm
using right now to do 1,000,000 ounces

512
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:30,920
for Android I have of course the problem
for building houses you really don't

513
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:34,470
know how successful you been until
somebody breaks into it using something

514
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:38,370
you didn't know was there are still far
that has not happened to me so I like to

515
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:42,380
think that I'm being relatively
successful at it I haven't filled it

516
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:48,710
reported an Android application without
at least several findings I don't

517
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:52,070
remember what the lowest one was there
there's there's there's a lot of stuff

518
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:55,000
out there but you need to educate
yourself on the platform

519
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,830
a little bit before you get started and
then hopefully this set of tools will

520
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:02,440
help you out and that's all I got so if
you guys have any questions we've got

521
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:06,020
about five minutes left and other than
that thank you very much for trying to

522
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:09,830
come to the conflict for years and it
always intersects with something bad I'm

523
00:50:09,830 --> 00:50:12,830
really glad I got a chance to get out
here

524
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:26,319
that's a great idea I should do exactly
that I hadn't even thought about that

525
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:31,700
question was whether any plans to
incorporate my test plan in the auspices

526
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:35,759
often I hadn't even considered it I
probably do that yeah I probably should

527
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:45,280
yes the web page

528
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:11,759
yes the Chrome browser has a plugin for
downloading the apks directly I had no

529
00:51:11,759 --> 00:51:25,190
clue yes it will so that's that's super
easy yeah I mean it she's prob around

530
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:30,499
while the end so if you have any
questions feel free to come grab me and

531
00:51:30,499 --> 00:51:32,339
thanks very much probably have a good
return home
