1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,380
paid thank you as you mentioned a little
bit about my background I do work at

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,969
Akamai Technologies and they are mostly
what I focus on in my day-to-day job is

3
00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:18,000
a.net cybercrime research I do security
incident response both for our customers

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,859
and for internal incidents we run a very
large content delivery network so you

5
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:28,660
can imagine some of the internet white
incidents that we have to deal with last

6
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:34,770
week was a lot of fun with brown and so
I also do a lot of security training and

7
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,940
workshops both internally and on the
side for things like system advancement

8
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:46,550
and other things like that so little bit
about the context of what we're gonna be

9
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:51,209
talking about the main rooms we're gonna
be looking at in order here are carting

10
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:57,840
credit card fraud account hijacking and
that's used in the cybercrime ecosystem

11
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:05,570
identity fraud and then he laundry so
what I am talking about in terms of

12
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:10,339
threat actors in these spaces are
carter's and low to mid-level I D

13
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:15,060
fraudsters what I am specifically not
talking about our state-backed actors or

14
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,740
major organized crime groups they have a
very different set of resources of

15
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:25,229
targets in drivers and so the defense is
there going to be different as well as

16
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:31,789
the ways in which they do what they do
in terms of currency that Greece's these

17
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:35,450
cybercrime wheels we're going to be
talking a little bit about crypto

18
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:39,890
currency mostly Bitcoin but in these
ecosystems we also see the use of dash

19
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:44,649
some of you might know this by its
former name is dark coin also like when

20
00:01:44,649 --> 00:01:48,890
is heavily involved in the Eastern
European bloc that's former Soviet bloc

21
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:56,810
perfect money is is used a lot as is OK
painewebber money there is also a lot of

22
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:05,119
demand in Asia and the Americas or
exchanges done with gift cards xbox live

23
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,860
gift cards amazon.com

24
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,399
and Walmart gift cards these are pretty
much as good as cash and a lot of these

25
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,880
underground economies

26
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:19,340
talking about why I think it's important
to look at these these particular areas

27
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:26,300
in Canada in the past five years I D
theft has tripled from 2010 to 2014 I D

28
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:33,730
fraud has jumped by 42% and the in the
USA and 240 in 2014 alone there was

29
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:38,670
sixteen billion dollars worth of I D
fraud perpetrated against about 12.7

30
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:43,920
million consumers in the USA there is a
new idea fraud victim every two seconds

31
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,890
now the first circle of hell that we're
gonna talk about here is guarding you

32
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:54,059
know what I want to give my talk a
little more legitimacy so instead of

33
00:02:54,060 --> 00:03:01,770
talking about circles will say this is
the first Magic Quadrant guarding it is

34
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:06,370
it's it's common and it doesn't cost
very much in terms of time and resources

35
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:13,720
to get into it is literally child's play
now these are all people who are showing

36
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:19,739
off what they've gotten out of partying
and the bottom left you'll see somebody

37
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:26,150
from the UK and the other three pictures
are people from South America all these

38
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,350
people have posted these things on
social media and they have all been

39
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:36,450
caught and put in jail so how do people
get your credit card information

40
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:42,620
well one of the big ways lately has been
through credit card skinny skimmers can

41
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:47,100
be attached to things like gas pumps
there have been once attached to Redbox

42
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,650
Redbox was really good responding to
this actually and that they've added on

43
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:56,870
their new models of the Redbox machines
huge block of metal right above the card

44
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:01,760
skimmer so you can actually add another
one on top of it which kudos to Redbox

45
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,429
for responding to that hand-held
scanners are also really popular

46
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:10,370
typically those will be used by somebody
that's in the service or food industry

47
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:15,270
and will have it and they give your card
to pay for your meal they'll put their

48
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,620
handheld scanner right underneath the
actual point of sale system

49
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,240
and just give your card through both at
the same time and this can just fit

50
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,940
right in your pocket there are also
rumors that have been popping up on when

51
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,870
you have an enclosed ATM and you have to
put your car didn't actually open the

52
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:36,290
door to get into the ATM we've been
finding scammers on the outside where

53
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:43,810
you actually put your card and open the
door so watch out for that it is 2016

54
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,290
but a single injection is still very
much alive and it is a way that a lot of

55
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:55,590
credit card information has gotten from
usually small web shops and sort of in

56
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:01,179
the same vein small mom-and-pop stores
that do payment processing either at the

57
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,690
end of the night or the end of the week
a lot of times they can keep these in

58
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:09,490
spreadsheets they can keep the
information in CSV or TXT files on the

59
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,949
managers computer so once that computer
gets popped then they have access to all

60
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:16,449
of that information

61
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:19,460
another way is through the point of sale
systems themselves I'm sure you heard

62
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,430
about this through Home Depot and target
but it doesn't have to be such a

63
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,139
concerted effort of a group going
through the HVAC system and all of that

64
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:31,520
since a lot of point of sale systems if
I'm sure you've seen when you go to buy

65
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,460
something at a store at the register
they've got all these open ports on the

66
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,940
back of the machine that does the
payment processing so that's that's

67
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,560
definitely available to you

68
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,160
anybody who wants to just walk up and
plug something in another way that this

69
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,740
is done is there's an employee that
works there that you pay them after

70
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,139
hours to go ahead and install malicious
software onto the point of sale system

71
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:58,550
but if you don't wanna go through all of
this hacking and learning sequel and

72
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:04,289
getting malware to put on a point of
sale system just go on the Dark Knight

73
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:06,590
and buy some credit cards

74
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:12,570
so these prices are from yesterday its
Italian Australian in Portuguese credit

75
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:18,450
cards for five bucks a pop us' credit
cards tend to be a lot cheaper and one

76
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:22,289
of the underground markets have so many
credit cards they need to offload that

77
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:26,160
they created an automatic store for it
I'm just here at the bottom you can

78
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,870
search for credit cards by the then by
the bank that they are you can search

79
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,780
specifically by the city state and zip
you can tell them I want to social

80
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,309
security number or date of birth

81
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,990
included with the credit card
information this cost a little more but

82
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:44,230
then you're able to bypass some extra
security checks you can also say what

83
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:48,440
the birth year to be between this or
this because it looks like how old I am

84
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,690
so I'm more likely to not get asked for
more identification you can also specify

85
00:06:53,690 --> 00:07:00,150
the type of card in the credit level so
what do they do with these credit cards

86
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:05,609
one of the cash I'll techniques is
buying tangible goods usually luxury

87
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:09,410
items or electronics and then they can
take those goods and then resell them

88
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:14,870
they usually use systems like wallop up
for sale craigslist is still heavily

89
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:18,630
used if you see a really good deal on
Craigslist think twice

90
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:25,210
also backpage.com is used for this but
you don't necessarily have to sell it

91
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:30,289
through one of these systems and meet
somebody in person a lot of Carter's

92
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:36,530
have set up their own web shops this is
both clear net and on tour i to pee will

93
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:40,530
set up shop for heavily discounted
electronics and you buy it hard for you

94
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:47,570
from the manufacture and ship it to you
another way to make money here buying

95
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:51,360
gift cards and then selling them on the
darknet for a discount

96
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:59,200
we'll talk more about the other side of
that later on so there are a number of

97
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,550
problems inherent in dealing with still
intangible you're having to receive and

98
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,100
send these goods in some manner so
you're potentially exposing your home or

99
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,250
business address also if you want to
deal with a P O box you're not using

100
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,250
your personal address you still have to
provide I D

101
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,180
cameras in there and then you have to me
employees face-to-face also if you're

102
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,680
going to use something called an
abandoned drunk this is where somebody

103
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,990
goes out of town use their address or
it's a recently abandoned business or

104
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,169
house then you can go ahead and have
things delivered there and then go pick

105
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:38,208
up but there are some issues with that
you don't know if the Postal Service is

106
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:41,549
actually going to deliver to the
addresses you don't know if there's mail

107
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:47,680
forwarding setup so your packages get
routed so instead you can use actual

108
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:54,060
people with actual addresses and have
them work at home for you and then you

109
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:59,050
can ship stuck to them and then they can
reshape it somewhere else and these

110
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:03,709
mules you do have to worry about them
stealing from you and since there is a

111
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:08,109
major law enforcement crackdown right
now on the shipping scams you really

112
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,399
have to worry about them

113
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:13,329
flipping on you to the cops and
throughout all of this what you have to

114
00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:17,640
worry about are controlled deliveries
this is where an officer of the law

115
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,510
options to be a postal carrier goes to
take a good that they know has been but

116
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:29,380
was stolen credentials and they go to
the person who its best we ship to have

117
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:36,120
them sign in a slap on the cuffs so one
Utrecht ice all to not deal with any of

118
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,870
the tangible goods themselves as
something called triangulation fraud and

119
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:44,500
this is where an unsuspecting customers
will go on a site like eBay or something

120
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,170
like that

121
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:50,689
good that they want and purchase it now
they send their order with the payment

122
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:55,390
through the purchasing system to the
fraudulent seller the seller doesn't

123
00:09:55,390 --> 00:10:01,439
actually have these goods in stock there
just selling a picture pretty much on

124
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,980
line and what they do once they get the
order and is the only take stolen credit

125
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,820
card information and then actually order
that item and then have it shipped to

126
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,350
the person who bought it now

127
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:15,480
the person who is the customer it looks
legitimate to them because they're

128
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,560
getting the good they said they wanted
online now when the cops come knockin

129
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,130
guess who they go after first the
unsuspecting customer the project seller

130
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:28,850
didn't actually touch the good anyway
but of course they can still be traced

131
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:29,139
through

132
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:35,199
the eBay or whatever the sales system
was so another way to not have to deal

133
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:39,849
with any of these tangible goods is to
just deal and digital goods a lot of

134
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,920
these digital goods can be found in
rewards programs accounts

135
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:50,279
these are things like airline accounts
retail travel hospitality you know when

136
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:53,619
you get to a hotel they asked to sign up
for a membership for their rewards

137
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:58,410
programs so through these systems you
can get things like vultures for goods

138
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:02,749
or four stays these are easily
transferable and thanks to a series of

139
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:08,399
class-action lawsuits they often do not
expire e-gift cards they're easily

140
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,329
transferable as well they're typically
good as cash and there's many outlets

141
00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:17,638
like legitimate outlets to resell them
so in order to get access to these

142
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:22,100
accounts and these goods will move to
our site at Magic Quadrant this is

143
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:26,189
account hijacking now this is a little
more uncommon it costs a little more in

144
00:11:26,189 --> 00:11:31,919
times of resource time and know-how and
some of the ways that these accounts are

145
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:36,899
hijacked are you know through malware
system gets infected and the owner of

146
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:42,879
the account was watching on the other
side of that malware that remote access

147
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:47,199
can go in and see this is the website
there at this is what they're typing in

148
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:51,779
capture the info from the keyboard
dumped all the credentials from their

149
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:57,019
browser because roads are terrible at
keeping those safe another way that it

150
00:11:57,019 --> 00:12:02,179
can be done is through basic fishing you
can see you know posed as the rewards

151
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:06,809
account program and say hey your account
has been hacked I need you to go ahead

152
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,868
and verify that you are the owner of the
account give me all of this information

153
00:12:09,869 --> 00:12:13,709
that gives me access to your account and
people fall for that all the time

154
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:21,910
especially for airline rewards accounts
a lot of them will just use for depends

155
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:27,858
which is terrible but they're very very
prone to brute-force attacks and the way

156
00:12:27,859 --> 00:12:31,220
that they get under the radar for the
brute force attacks as they'll have a

157
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,269
series of you see here that third column
they have a series of proxies that they

158
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:40,910
roll thru while they're trying to force
the logon now the one that we've been

159
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,240
seeing the most lately

160
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,740
account checkers this is a web based
checker but they also have offline

161
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:52,370
versions and what you do for these
accounts checkers is you put in the

162
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:56,580
username or email address and then the
password you just fill out that list of

163
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:00,910
a whole bunch of login information and
then on the far right can put your proxy

164
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,790
information and then we'll do a little
test all of this all of these

165
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:08,540
credentials against a number of
different but sites to see which ones

166
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:13,319
you get access to so where are you
getting all of these credentials while

167
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,580
there's been so many breaches in leaks
lately that you can just use the

168
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:24,980
information from adultfriendfinder from
my spy database from the MIT dumps all

169
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:30,050
those have a series of credentials but
nobody here uses the same login

170
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:38,279
credentials across multiple websites
right so what we're seeing with these

171
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:43,310
checkered taxes they wouldn't just focus
on one industry they'd hit customers at

172
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:47,449
the same time across multiple industries
usually focusing on retail travel and

173
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:52,370
hospitality that we have lately seen
them branch out a little more and the

174
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:57,190
type of traffic that we see is coming
from different botnets in there rolling

175
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:01,000
through multiple proxies sometimes their
public proxies sometimes their private

176
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,420
we saw a lot of IP's from Jolla VPN
thanks a lot of IP's from the Mac botnet

177
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:12,479
a lot of shared hosting IP's now these
are where somebody has a web server and

178
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,700
it's either been compromised or the
hosting service has been bought using

179
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:24,020
stolen credentials also routers lots and
lots of home routers we've seen doing

180
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,800
these account checker attacks and this
is because a lot of router manufacturers

181
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:35,260
will ship out routers that have you know
hardcoded back doors or hardcoded oh

182
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,930
well they're not back doors they're you
know thanks to their service people can

183
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:44,709
get in and fix your problems right but
they also have you know hardcoded admin

184
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:50,310
login credentials that you can actually
change without changing the firmware so

185
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,719
what we saw with these account checker
games and what i'm talking about its

186
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,010
just within the past year we would see
them run about 12 hours straight and

187
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:03,100
then suddenly drop off and these 12 hour
blocks we found we're not matching up

188
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,889
with typical us' work hours so that's
one day two point it doesn't tell you

189
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:12,730
who it was but it's one data point we
found that they adapted quickly to Geo

190
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:19,079
blocks and they adapted very quickly to
us just serving them 403 errors so the

191
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:22,739
things that we put in place that we
found where semi effective where

192
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:28,630
blacklisting whole IP blocks and then
also putting in stricter rate controls

193
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:33,730
on the login pages themselves and then
since a lot of these automated checker

194
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:39,589
programs don't do a very good job of
having you know refers information

195
00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:43,490
filled out all the way we were also
checking for valid refers which helped

196
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:48,690
block a lot of that traffic as well now
they were able to sort of pivot their

197
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:53,870
tactics and get around these things so
we had to go to the next level and we

198
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,769
saw some of the super effective methods
for stopping them we're adding

199
00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:02,230
additional login info requirements like
the last name or the street address or

200
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:05,820
something like that and since they had
already set up their systems to just

201
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,959
look at username and password we are
able to foil a lot of the automation

202
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:15,119
they're also we found a lot of the
mobile in API login logic was not nearly

203
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,019
as strict as the browser-based loggins
so those were definitely being exported

204
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:25,420
and hit so updating those made a big
difference we also funnily enough found

205
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:30,360
a whole bunch of legacy login paths that
were like David paths or old past that

206
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,329
were never knew and half the time the
customers didn't even know that these

207
00:16:34,329 --> 00:16:37,469
paths still exists so that was cute

208
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:42,680
we also found that instead of just
blocking their requests so they switched

209
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:47,510
to another proxy or another VPN IP then
we could carpet them along rather

210
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:51,389
traffic and just make it really really
slow for every single one of their

211
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:55,089
requests we made sure it didn't time out
but it would just take a very very long

212
00:16:55,089 --> 00:16:59,569
time for them to do even one check up on
a cattle and then at the end of that

213
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:01,939
what we would do is even if

214
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:06,628
the account information was not correct
we would send them to a fake you've been

215
00:17:06,628 --> 00:17:07,230
logged in

216
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:10,579
page so they would think the credentials
were correct and then go to the next set

217
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:15,408
of credentials once they started getting
really frustrated with these methods we

218
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:26,500
saw them really drop off activity for
people trying to get to digital goods I

219
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:31,330
went to see what the market place looks
like so I decided to first take a look

220
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:36,100
at the darknet tour markets un rato
markets and I wanted to make sure that

221
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:41,870
the market I looked at had really good
activity they had good times greater

222
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:46,658
than 95% I wanted to also make sure that
they were popular so I only looked at

223
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:50,399
the markets that had Google search
imprints greater than 60,000 and Google

224
00:17:50,399 --> 00:17:55,668
keywords greater than a hundred that led
me to look at arguably the top 3 12

225
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:56,700
markets right now

226
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,840
alphabet a dream market and nucleus
market and just doing a cursory check of

227
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,259
these markets I found that they did
indeed have some of these digital goods

228
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:11,029
on offer vouchers for restaurants for
spas where their cultures for

229
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:16,159
transportation in this case trains in
the UK and these are all in heavy

230
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:21,269
discount of course eGift Cards home
shopping network

231
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:26,450
Walmart gift cards and gift card that I
sold like far and above all the others

232
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:32,149
were Whole Foods Market gift cards which
was interesting so I guess I guess the

233
00:18:32,149 --> 00:18:38,809
hackers like to eat well there are also
a lot of digital points for sale lots of

234
00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:45,580
GameStop points and then of course air
miles for sale so once I saw that that

235
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:49,240
that sort of those sort of goods were
actually for sale and wanted to get some

236
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:56,129
hard numbers on what the market numbers
look like so when i didnt overall view

237
00:18:56,129 --> 00:18:59,330
of these markets in terms of digital
goods for sale these are accounts

238
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:03,230
malware gift cards things like that
there were fourteen thousand one hundred

239
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:07,820
and eighty three separate listings
across these three markets for fraud

240
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:11,769
related goods these are credit card
numbers bank drops packets of personally

241
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:13,549
identifiable information

242
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:14,809
15,000 for

243
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:19,370
hundred and twenty six separate
offerings so for the rewards accounts

244
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:23,399
themselves and buying and purchasing the
login information and when I say rewards

245
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:28,518
accounts these are where the posting to
purchase the account actually says this

246
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:31,460
account has a points balance this
account has a credit card attached

247
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:36,990
things like that I saw twenty different
listings across seven unique vendors

248
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:43,200
resulting in 2014 confirm sales now for
the things that you get out of these

249
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,139
accounts for vouchers and gift cards
they were fifty four separate listings

250
00:19:48,139 --> 00:19:57,019
across 13 unique vendors resulting in
3,100 and 36 sales for rewards points we

251
00:19:57,019 --> 00:20:02,570
saw free listings across only three
unique vendors but it was a total of 698

252
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:05,820
sales it looks like they're really
cornering the market on the points

253
00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:12,220
air miles though I only saw for listings
across for vendors and only 100 sales

254
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:17,259
and they were all of those hundred sales
were only for two different airlines now

255
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:22,110
what's going on here I went and went
through reviewing the policies of the

256
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:25,658
bunch of different airlines and found
that within the past few years the

257
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:29,740
airlines have really been cracking down
on this type of fraud and really been

258
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:33,830
ratcheting down what the requirements
are for transferring points between

259
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:39,269
accounts and a lot of times they require
there to be a proof of a life upset or

260
00:20:39,269 --> 00:20:43,220
it has to be somebody who you're related
to or you know all these hoops you have

261
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:47,940
to jump through and criminals are
typically looking for the quick buck or

262
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,309
the low-hanging fruit so they just won't
bother with it now

263
00:20:52,309 --> 00:21:00,639
the section of this this market that
really really blew my mind where there

264
00:21:00,639 --> 00:21:05,969
were a whole bunch of personal criminal
travel agents with these guys would do

265
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:10,210
is they would put on an offering for
they would book your flights they would

266
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:14,509
book your rental car they would get your
hotel room they they could set up a

267
00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:17,100
cruise for you and

268
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:21,030
it seemed to be like really profitable
for them because there was a lot of them

269
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:27,470
and the reviews for these services were
like off the charts rave reviews so I

270
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:36,039
saw 93 general listings for these travel
agents 94 custom orders for travel 31

271
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:41,809
different vendors offering these
services totally in 4808 individual

272
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:45,918
confirm sales and like I said almost
every single one was a rave reviews

273
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:52,840
saying I got exactly what they wanted
and my travel was amazing so I give you

274
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:57,780
an idea about these numbers in context
of time so this was across 10 months I

275
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:03,260
gathered this data and it was looking at
only three of the markets out there so

276
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:07,240
across 10 months and only three markets
there were ten thousand seven hundred

277
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:12,570
and fifty six individual sales of stolen
rewards related goods I'd say there's a

278
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:18,240
large enough market so there are some
bonuses to getting these rewards

279
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,120
accounts a lot of times because people
don't want to have to enter in their

280
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,580
credit card number every single time
they'll save their credit card

281
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:28,120
information to their account so when
somebody pops out account they can use

282
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,340
that credit card information to buy
other stuff there's also personal

283
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:37,480
information in these accounts things
like addresses phone numbers email

284
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:42,250
addresses things like that there's also
a lot of cross program fraud available

285
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:46,669
because what will happen is rewards
networks will hook up with one another

286
00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:50,720
so that you can use an account on one to
buy goods from another so they would be

287
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,179
able to even though they didn't pop this
airline they were able to through this

288
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:58,820
hotel by airline so when you're done
with all of this

289
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:03,520
got all the goods out of it that you
want you sold all of the points that you

290
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:09,059
bought you can then sell the account
itself to use PSN accounts for sale

291
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:12,940
GameStop logins and here you see it
actually says that hey look there is a

292
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:17,059
credit card attached and their points on
the balanced crunchyroll lifetime

293
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:21,350
accounts Burberry J Crew Musician's
Friend so these this is just a very

294
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:26,939
small sampling of all the help available
right now these guys have become an

295
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,930
outright but how do they actually get
the

296
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:37,300
cash while another huge section of this
underground economy our guides to how to

297
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:45,930
cash out most of the guys will start by
telling you use a Bitcoin tumblr tumblr

298
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:50,440
does is take your big wins and a lot of
other people's big points and mixes them

299
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:55,190
all together and then sends you cleaner
bitcoins been mixed with a bunch of

300
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:59,620
other people to me to obfuscate the
trail of the money now if you're a

301
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,060
decent forensics person that knows how
to use the block chain you can trace

302
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:07,669
that pretty easily so what a lot of
these guys say to do is to make a whole

303
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:12,320
bunch of small transactions staggered
over time to a number of different

304
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:19,090
tumblers and then two different Wallace
and then only get harder now there are

305
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:23,389
some tools out there for doing that
Queen transaction analysis increasing

306
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:31,300
one of them is actually offered by block
chain dot info and for us

307
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:39,159
thirteen-year old middle school boys
it's horribly named its 10th analysis so

308
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:43,950
be careful talking about that in the
work environment like yo Gary give me

309
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:51,400
your Bitcoin address so I can analyzer
tape so what this does is it looks at

310
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:56,170
the amount of activity between different
wallets and then starts to build

311
00:24:56,170 --> 00:25:00,240
relationship models for you and that's
really useful for looking at

312
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,650
transactions over time between walls
another really useful tool here

313
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:12,210
block seeker this has a really nice
visual GUI and it allows you to zoom in

314
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:17,800
and move around and click on different
transfer parts this is actually the silk

315
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:25,149
road option for the declines gotten from
DPR in the Silk Road by the feds and you

316
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:28,810
can see Tim Draper bought a whole bunch
of them as well as some other people and

317
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:32,840
what the site does is it takes wallets
takes a whole bunch of open source

318
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,250
intelligence information and then
information from

319
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:40,640
their partners to actually start
labeling wallets with who they think it

320
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,640
which is really useful

321
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:24,290
back so in order to actually get to cash
through these now cleaner bitcoins

322
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:28,799
you're going to have to move into the
next Magic Quadrant the next circle of

323
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:35,710
hell I D theft so I D theft is more
uncommon and it definitely takes more in

324
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:42,710
terms of resources time and know how but
luckily since 2005 there have been about

325
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:49,850
5,700 breaches of personal information
including 855 million unencrypted

326
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:56,080
records involving people's personal
information so now there's lots of stuff

327
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,428
on the market so why do you need this
information

328
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:05,370
well a lot of especially financial
services but a lot of services they rely

329
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:09,500
on something called knowledge-based
authentication this is you proving that

330
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:14,299
you are who you say you r by virtue of
knowing something that somebody else

331
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:22,010
might not know so you need this sort of
information to reset a Verified by Visa

332
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:27,840
code or MasterCard SecureCode when you
try to access an account that's

333
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,409
pre-existing and you want to answer
security questions this is the type of

334
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:35,450
information you need when you're going
to set up a financial services account

335
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:38,130
alot of times though ask you for
information about your credit history

336
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:43,770
class for past phone numbers addresses
that you've lived at what you are

337
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:50,340
national idea number is your SSN is you
or your passport number so examples of

338
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:54,409
services that asked for this corn-based
circle in Southborough are arguably the

339
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:58,980
three largest Bitcoin exchanges and they
all require they all follow the

340
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:03,390
anti-money laundering and know your
customer laws which means that they not

341
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:08,330
only ask you for your social or your
passport but they also asked you for

342
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:12,918
additional information that you're
supposed to know other money involved

343
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:14,280
services like this

344
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,240
PayPal Skrill

345
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,470
some of you might know that is
Moneybookers Google Wallet also stripes

346
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:25,059
wearing eBay if you're going to set up a
seller account require additional

347
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:30,610
information if you're going to wire
funds Western Union Moneygram they

348
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:35,590
require additional information about
your identity as well luckily you can go

349
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:40,889
back to the darknet market and buy
something called fools a few LLC and

350
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:44,740
these are packets of personal
information about somebody somebody who

351
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:49,309
you're going to take on as an outside
skin and it gives you information about

352
00:28:49,309 --> 00:28:54,309
their emails addresses their passwords
full name including mother's maiden name

353
00:28:54,309 --> 00:28:55,629
if applicable

354
00:28:55,630 --> 00:29:01,000
date of birth age history of addresses
billing telephone and also interestingly

355
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,660
enough their IP address location
user-agent browser and platform now why

356
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:11,280
would you need that well turns out a lot
of financial service accounts are

357
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:15,059
starting to fingerprint people when they
log in and what they do is they look for

358
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:19,420
anomalous behavior to see if this person
is using a completely different machine

359
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:23,170
or browser where they're coming from a
completely different GOI better flag

360
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:27,230
this unlock the account but if you have
all this information you can emulate all

361
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:30,350
of that to look like the person is
longing in the same as they always log

362
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:36,740
in now once you are setting up account
or trying to transfer funds they might

363
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:41,179
ask you for additional verification you
can also buy that stuff on the darknet

364
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:46,429
customized make statements passport I D
scans have been doctored to your

365
00:29:46,429 --> 00:29:47,900
whatever you want

366
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:54,090
driver's license cans are you can also
get custom gas bills or power bills if

367
00:29:54,090 --> 00:30:01,480
you have to show that so a lot of times
cybercriminals it's worth the extra

368
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,950
money and effort to go through I D theft
because while credit card numbers are

369
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:12,640
easily burned and replaced also having
this identity allows you to have

370
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,460
longer-term schemes and more different
types of fraud as well as complimentary

371
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:23,309
fraud it allows typically for bigger
payouts and has a built-in scapegoat the

372
00:30:23,309 --> 00:30:29,389
person whose identity you're using now
if through if you're a cybercriminal and

373
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:33,820
you have to actually get a physical IDE
card for some reason you don't actually

374
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:37,750
have to go back to the darknet to buy
that you can just get it from read it

375
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:44,360
this is a very funny subreddit I suggest
you all go look and read it's it's

376
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:48,080
mostly high school kids that are trying
to buy booze so it's it's pretty funny

377
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:57,580
so some their types of fraud that you
can perpetrate with these IDs loan fraud

378
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:02,678
you can take out personal or business
loans you can take out student loans

379
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:07,790
there plenty of guides for that there
are also if the person whose identity

380
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:11,740
you have owns land or property or house
there's a lot of mortgage and title

381
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:18,410
fraud that you can use to transfer the
title over to another entity this is a

382
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:22,640
really big problem in Canada right now
there are also cash advances that you

383
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,340
can get on credit and there are loan
services where you don't have to go in

384
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,820
person you don't even have to talk to
somebody on the phone you can just do it

385
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:32,240
completely all online sometimes just to
chat

386
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:40,970
terrible also tax frauds and he said IRS
before so you know tax refund

387
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:46,090
interception you file for a refund as
them before they do and then you get the

388
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:50,540
refund you can do this digitally through
H&R Block and terror attacks they make

389
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:56,440
it really easy for you also there were a
number of guides on posing as a revenue

390
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:02,440
agent and what you'll do is since you
already have some PII you can act like

391
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,900
you actually already are an agent and
know about this person in their account

392
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,669
and you're about to audit them they get
so scared that they give up all kinds of

393
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:14,120
information about to get audited you can
also demand payment from them and say

394
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:20,439
hey if you pay this fee right up front
to this encounter this address then I'll

395
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:27,780
go ahead and stop the audit for you
people fall for this also if the packet

396
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,770
of information or identity that you get
includes medical information or

397
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:35,560
insurance information which you can pay
a little extra for you can set up a fake

398
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:39,149
clinic and start charging those
identities you can also clue

399
00:32:39,149 --> 00:32:42,539
with a pre-existing care provider their
number of people in florida that are

400
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:46,559
getting pumped for this right now and
what you do is you provide the

401
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:50,799
identities and then you give a cut of
the funds that you get back from the

402
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:55,999
insurance to the care provider that
you're working with you can also sell

403
00:32:55,999 --> 00:33:00,190
these identities and insurance
information to people who don't have

404
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:03,909
insurance or uncovered then they can
post as that person to get services

405
00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:09,399
a lot of these ideas that come with
medical information are also used two

406
00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:14,459
sides sidestep limits on certain
prescriptions so if you hit your limit

407
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:18,070
on one identity and you just go to the
next identity and get all your pills

408
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:25,168
next video your pills until you have a
stock pile so now that you know we're

409
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:29,249
starting to get some funds it still
traceable to us so how do we further

410
00:33:29,249 --> 00:33:35,249
obscure the flow of money how do we
start to launder this online will move

411
00:33:35,249 --> 00:33:40,789
us into our next circle our next Magic
Quadrant laundering which is more

412
00:33:40,789 --> 00:33:46,820
expensive for sure and definitely rare
so some of the ways that you can launder

413
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:51,299
your online funds 5 I'm sure a lot of
you have heard of you set up two

414
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:55,469
accounts one is a service provider in 10
somebody who needs a service I you could

415
00:33:55,469 --> 00:33:59,659
make up whatever service you want Reiki
healing through the Internet I don't

416
00:33:59,659 --> 00:34:06,779
know so you go ahead and take the gotten
money as a buyer and you say hey yes I

417
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:10,710
really need some of that Internet Reiki
healing and then since you're on both

418
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:14,918
sides of the equation here that money is
going through fiber and then you're

419
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:20,480
getting paid out of 5 per so you can do
the same exact scam through sites like

420
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,569
freelancer guru up work where you poses
both the person offering the service and

421
00:34:25,569 --> 00:34:32,730
the person that needs the service can
also just set up your own web shop

422
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:39,299
offering whatever dude ads or call are
you want self you can do this through

423
00:34:39,299 --> 00:34:44,190
Etsy you can set up a flight stripes
Park payer square account but for those

424
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:48,829
who would need to attach a bank account
usually well not to worry you can go

425
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:54,389
back onto the darkness and by bank
accounts now typically you might not

426
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:58,200
want to do that because well whoever
selling it to you probably still has

427
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,470
access to that account so what you can
do is take that identity and set up a

428
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:05,609
new bank account sometimes you don't
even have to go in person you can just

429
00:35:05,609 --> 00:35:10,190
set up a bank account online or you
could just do it over the phone or I

430
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:15,700
have also seen guides which we're really
despicable on how to find a junkie and

431
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:21,569
pay them to set up an account for you
some other ways that you can launder

432
00:35:21,569 --> 00:35:26,619
money then I read guides on all of these
things is there are people who will sell

433
00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:32,430
you gold and silver bars for Bitcoin
it's a really really hefty premium

434
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:36,089
though you're losing a lot of your money
that way but of course stolen money so

435
00:35:36,089 --> 00:35:41,980
whatever there are also a lot of
gambling websites that will take pic

436
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:45,599
wine so what you do is you put the
Bitcoin into the gambling website you do

437
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,819
a couple you know low risk gambling you
let it sit there for a little while and

438
00:35:49,819 --> 00:35:53,430
then you cash out you tell them I don't
want to Bitcoin I wanna in a money order

439
00:35:53,430 --> 00:36:05,149
or I wanna in gift cards or something
like that yes about the whole nother

440
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:12,980
talk and yes that is a huge problem so I
think it was one of the online like

441
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:20,049
World Series of Poker they had a problem
just three months ago where the top two

442
00:36:20,049 --> 00:36:23,049
players and their tournament where both
bots

443
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:27,030
and they they weren't able to contact
them because there's nobody there behind

444
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:32,960
it so also when we talked about before

445
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,930
help people were using stolen credit
cards to buy gift cards in the resell

446
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:37,089
them at a discount

447
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:41,380
well you can use your bitcoins to buy
these gift cards at a discount and then

448
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:46,580
resell them to a legit site like gift
card granny also many pawn shops now are

449
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:51,200
buying gift cards so that's another
outlet this one I thought was really

450
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,750
clever you can go online and with
bitcoins you can buy stolen during lift

451
00:36:55,750 --> 00:37:00,900
user accounts which would then do as you
would set up your own driver account and

452
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,730
you would use something called ghosting
and their software that allows you to do

453
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:08,420
this and trick of systems and so what
you do is you go through this stolen

454
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:12,140
accounts and just charge them for rides
that never occur and so you get the

455
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,509
money back out through her left 30
driver

456
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:18,869
you can also again at a premium

457
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:22,690
there are people that will sell you a
prepaid cards like mandela cards are

458
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:28,369
green moneypak cards for Bitcoin and you
can use those pretty much as debit or

459
00:37:28,369 --> 00:37:34,310
ATM cards anywhere there's also another
option for getting your bitcoins into

460
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:39,790
cash and that is between direct cards
now the problem here is almost every

461
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:46,190
single one of these big queen cards are
backed by a new very small not very well

462
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:53,869
vetted Eastern European bank that just
sprouted up recently so really shaky in

463
00:37:53,869 --> 00:37:59,869
the next section of ways in which to
launder money that I saw was really

464
00:37:59,869 --> 00:38:07,490
really despicable I call this no soul
edition and this is starting up

465
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:10,490
charities

466
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:17,780
so bonus points if your charity website
Hassli console over it because then it's

467
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:22,330
legit right so they were guides for
starting your own church for starting

468
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:29,049
your own political action committee also
bonus if you get your own 501 and what

469
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:32,950
you would do as you would start up the
front web page to tell people about this

470
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:36,299
charity that you've created and then on
the back into it hook it up to something

471
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:41,740
like champ or I it's or give well PayPal
even has its own section for charities

472
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:47,549
Network for Good is another one that I
saw guides for and the reason why I say

473
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:51,760
no soul is because almost every single
one of these guys were really really

474
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,720
excited about the fact that not only are
you laundering your money but other

475
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:02,439
people will give you money for foreach
who write so let's talk about some of

476
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,770
the defense's for stopping the sort of
crime or at least making it a lot harder

477
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:12,670
if you're a general holder of personally
identifiable information which most

478
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:16,950
businesses in the digital world are of
some sort you know of course I'm gonna

479
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:22,490
sound like a broken record but encrypt
not only in transit but also at risk at

480
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:26,930
rest you know doing encryption with your
single database is not going to make

481
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:33,040
such a huge hit on your performance that
it's not worth it also asking for

482
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,950
unneeded info a lot of especially
start-up businesses like oh we can use

483
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:40,640
this info in the future to monetize in
this way we can use this extra info that

484
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:45,009
we're getting from his customers to
maybe in the future at this future if

485
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:51,730
you don't need it don't keep it it's a
liability don't get a hoarder and also

486
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:55,480
an optimizing data is very very hard if
you think you can itemize the data and

487
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,650
you're just giving out medidata either
to your partners or third-parties are

488
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:04,040
reselling it there are a lot of ways to
turn that metadata back into personal

489
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:12,630
information if you are a company that
has rewards programs think about right

490
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:16,090
off the bat putting rate controls and
really paying attention to those rate

491
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:22,480
controls for logins instead of using the
basic stand by email address and

492
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,130
password

493
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:29,380
try generating unique IDs for each of
the each of your users login numbers so

494
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:36,530
that you can't be hit by my count reuse
groups also passed phrases please please

495
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:41,450
please start using for depends if you
factor a multi-factor authentication

496
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:46,730
very useful important criminals for the
most part don't want to deal with that

497
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:52,290
shit anomaly detection start doing
baseline analysis of your users and

498
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:55,370
their accounts and how they're using
their accounts when you see that

499
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:59,069
different geographies are starting to
access their account features when

500
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:05,910
there's been changes to major
information like the email address email

501
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:10,620
address or physical shipping address to
the account back in with a customer and

502
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:15,390
say hey did you actually mean to change
this is legitimate also just looking at

503
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:19,890
general account use if the account is
just buying buying buying when they've

504
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:25,460
only been an account that sporadically
use their points that's a red flag there

505
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:29,980
and start looking closer at that account
if you're someone who runs a point of

506
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:34,990
sale system of course encryption don't
put it on the managers computer in a

507
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:40,509
text file securing hardware access is
really important you know when you've

508
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:46,090
got your front or whoever is going to be
taking money make sure that back of the

509
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:52,280
computer is is off limits to customers
for your web presence web application

510
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:56,300
firewalls are great especially if you
start to learn how to actually tune them

511
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:00,530
and get what you want out of them using
of course for you using Google database

512
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:05,320
is prepared statements in proper
sanitation and also regularly review

513
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:08,520
your business logic especially as you're
adding new components to your web

514
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:12,860
interface can cause your business logic
over time not to operate in the way you

515
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:15,569
expect it to allow for

516
00:42:15,569 --> 00:42:22,630
other interesting ways to get what you
shouldn't get as a customer if you are

517
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:26,489
giving out some form of loans for god
sakes require at least a conversation

518
00:42:26,489 --> 00:42:33,849
it's even better if you require an
in-person interview before the close of

519
00:42:33,849 --> 00:42:39,869
alone this will scare off the vast
majority of fraudsters if you see a

520
00:42:39,869 --> 00:42:44,940
number attached to a application for a
loan that's a red flag right there

521
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:49,859
fraudsters love to use VoIP apps and
they'll buy and sell different numbers

522
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:56,670
and banks of numbers online if you start
to see a major influx from a particular

523
00:42:56,670 --> 00:43:00,839
geography that you didn't see a lot
before that should be a red flag that

524
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:06,229
there's a concerted effort to perpetrate
loan fraud there also don't have a

525
00:43:06,229 --> 00:43:10,609
standard set of questions that you ask
for every single loan all the guides

526
00:43:10,609 --> 00:43:14,640
lysol for perpetrating loan fraud what
you're paying for in the guide is it

527
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,839
walks you through every single question
to ask and the answer is that they want

528
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:25,469
so throwing her ball questions can make
a big difference there for everybody all

529
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:29,680
of these systems training your employees
especially the ones that are gonna be

530
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,640
customer-facing that are going to see
the fraudsters before anybody else does

531
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:38,900
teach them about social engineering
start doing some some workshops with

532
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:43,259
them teach them and keep them up-to-date
on current trends in fraud in different

533
00:43:43,259 --> 00:43:49,119
ways that you know these guys are trying
to weasel their way and also really

534
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,160
important and seriously lacking is
having clear escalation paths for these

535
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,578
tier 1 people that are on the front
lines when they start to feel weird

536
00:43:56,579 --> 00:43:59,119
about something instead of being
pressured into doing something they

537
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:03,410
shouldn't they should know that they can
escalate to somebody above them right

538
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:08,558
away right when they feel that there's
something off or something hehe now for

539
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:13,309
your personal protection of course it's
easier to save your information into

540
00:44:13,309 --> 00:44:16,769
these websites for later use but
statistically that information is going

541
00:44:16,769 --> 00:44:20,779
to be leaked at some point in time so
don't save your in your credit card

542
00:44:20,779 --> 00:44:25,089
information and all your personal
information into these websites check

543
00:44:25,089 --> 00:44:27,049
for skimmers as we talked before

544
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:31,530
I give a little tug whenever you go to
swipe your card a lot of times if there

545
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:37,160
is an actual skinny on it'll pop off
don't take it home to research with it

546
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:43,220
as it looks really sketchy especially on
the cameras so contact the authorities

547
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:48,390
right away and say hey I found this you
know credit card skimmer using VPNs and

548
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:53,319
public places so you're not man in the
middle or given russia's content having

549
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:59,480
that injected also when using a VPN I
highly recommend using no split or not

550
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,850
leaking a whole bunch of useful
information

551
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:05,870
also this wasn't the case five or 10
years ago but now there are some pretty

552
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:13,609
legit credit and I do you watch services
lifeguard is not one of them i no

553
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:19,640
lifeguard is right now on like a huge
you know spree marketing and of linking

554
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:23,700
up with a whole bunch of other large
name companies it's it's still i mean

555
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:27,730
they are so right now in the middle of
2010 lawsuits for not providing the

556
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:36,570
protection they said they would use them
also your credentials don't reuse them

557
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:41,610
across multiple websites also rotate
them often so if there is a breach of

558
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:46,000
one of those websites your credentials
are no longer useful and one thing that

559
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,490
can make this a lot easier instead of
trying to store all these different

560
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:54,569
logins and passwords in your head is
using a good password vault a lot of

561
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:58,420
these bolts have options to periodically
go through and rotate your credentials

562
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:02,340
for you and even to the point where it's
a really long complex password that you

563
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:05,270
don't have to remember at all they don't
even know so even if you're tortured you

564
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:10,650
can tell your security questions now
it's really good when you can put in

565
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:15,660
your own security questions and make up
some just off the wall shit but a lot of

566
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:20,330
times what you're stuck with is a drop
down menu and what kind of questions

567
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:26,009
these drop down menus usually have your
favorite pet your anniversary your kid's

568
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:30,160
birthday stupid stuff like that that
everybody has on their social media

569
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,910
accounts so when you're going to answer
security questions

570
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:38,040
think is this information that can be
gleaned through my social media

571
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:42,800
also keeping an adversarial mindset in
general like every time you go through a

572
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,170
system to use it or to set up an account

573
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:48,640
think like a hacker say alright if I
want to fuck with this part of the

574
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,520
website where that part of the website
what would I do and how easy would it be

575
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:59,509
and if it actually does happen that you
get your ideas whether some fraud

576
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:03,870
perpetrated against you file a police
report right away that we please report

577
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:07,400
isn't gonna do much for you in that
moment most likely but what it does it

578
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:12,560
as legitimacy in credence to your future
claims about you know things happening

579
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:18,259
to you based on that fraud you can also
go into your credit reporting agencies

580
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:22,880
and other three main ones and you can
set a fraud alert on your credit that

581
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,550
way when somebody a fraudster goes and
tries to take out a loan in your name or

582
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:30,840
tries to buy a car it'll get flagged and
the person who goes to run a credit

583
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:34,870
check will say hey maybe this person
isn't they say they are also of course

584
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:41,100
replace your cards as quickly as
possible and that's you know pretty easy

585
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:46,190
to do is call your credit card company
so I know that I didn't cover all of the

586
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:53,230
ways that I D fraud in cash outs happen
in this day and age and I know there are

587
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:56,630
different ones out there in different
ways to protect yourself I definitely

588
00:47:56,630 --> 00:48:00,320
want to know about those so please email
me if you didn't see anything in this

589
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:05,530
that you think is really interesting or
that you ran into yourself I'd really

590
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:08,660
love to hear about that thats be brown
socks @ gmail.com

591
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:14,299
and i'm open for questions and comments
now yes right in the front

592
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:37,549
and they're typically going through
multiple nodes are hurting other

593
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:41,080
features and hear johnnie reserved

594
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,580
that's a great point but you probably
also when I think about not using the

595
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:17,270
same wrong answer over and over again
because once one of those gets popped

596
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:20,270
that they can just return

597
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:37,090
there

598
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:52,990
LifeLock that's why I meant I was just
in the pool area on saw lifeguard on the

599
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:59,839
signs yes

600
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:08,250
even when they do charge it's not very
much

601
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:37,288
that's awesome

602
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:54,900
I will do my own research and one of the
things you don't really want to look at

603
00:50:54,900 --> 00:51:00,350
is what people have said about them on
BBB Better Business Bureau and of course

604
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:05,410
take that with a grain of salt but also
look and see what court cases they have

605
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:11,379
had and look and see who the CEO and the
board members are and what other

606
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:14,510
companies they're involved with if
they're involved with other companies

607
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:19,920
that have been shut down in the past for
you know not doing the protection that

608
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,580
they said they would then that's a red
flag there that they're probably not

609
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:29,770
doing so hot and this round either thank
you everybody
