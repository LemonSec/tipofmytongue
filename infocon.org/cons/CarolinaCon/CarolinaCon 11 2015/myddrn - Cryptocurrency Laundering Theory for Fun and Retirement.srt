1
00:00:01,689 --> 00:00:05,170
thank you yeah I have no idea to pass
that either don't worry about it

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:08,690
I undercut the currency for fun
retirement

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:12,090
love about me I assorted

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,540
handles and groups I here on behalf of
myself

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:21,020
now my employer stepped out of the way I
just think that the currency is ni

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,850
I'm just the guy I read some stuff I'm
not that smart you can probably do this

7
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,150
better and you should

8
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,390
do this better so

9
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,020
already cover we're gonna talk about

10
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,600
typical crypto currency transactions
we're gonna talk about why desiring his

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,460
lawyer

12
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,000
my wondering is desirable and necessary
if you're planning to steal

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
the currency I we're gonna talk about
why

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,350
laundering anonymity and transaction
history matters

15
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,520
beyond stuffed and then we're going to
talk about some laundry in theory and

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,390
practice

17
00:00:55,390 --> 00:01:00,750
and we're gonna talk about zero cash and
kinda the future anonymous transactions

18
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,400
so I guess kinda before I get into
this--

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,310
this assumes kinda baseline knowledge of
crypto currency is a thing

20
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:13,140
I assume all you can read Wikipedia and
kinda figure that out

21
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,200
so let's jump into what crypto currency
transactions are

22
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,540
actually you have your setup inputs have
your setup outputs

23
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,650
your inputs reference previous outputs

24
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:33,119
and inputs are just basically an amount
say one big point and you just wanna say

25
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,850
I have an input a 1-bit coin I have an
output of one break point

26
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:40,240
the input is coming from my address

27
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,490
the output is going to my buddies and
Russ or

28
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:48,909
my address or whoever's address and the
difference in the amount of the inputs

29
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:52,180
and outputs is your transaction fee
that's paid to the minors to give them

30
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,590
an incentive to actually processed
transactions

31
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:58,810
so a typical transaction would look
something like this:

32
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:02,649
you have your input you have your output
in your mouth and I

33
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:06,920
screenshot of us this morning of bob
watching that and

34
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,979
so the other P so this

35
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:14,530
the kinda now is that watching that info
and anybody can record this information

36
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,450
on kinda does all this need staff were

37
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:24,110
they think it came from the UK I was
received a certain time the amount saw

38
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,709
so transactions

39
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:31,549
incurred to currency you are amazing
complicated and you can do way more with

40
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:33,260
them then just send people money

41
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:37,540
on its worth reading about out we're not
really gonna get into that here

42
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,400
so if you think about the lineage

43
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,500
over transaction you we talk about the
inputs

44
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,269
and the outputs you can follow that path
because those inputs require

45
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:52,879
cryptographic primitives to you now sign
them

46
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,430
essentially and you can follow those
back to a chain of inputs and outputs

47
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,670
NC where bitcoins came from or

48
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:04,620
whatever purpose currency and

49
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,870
the other pieces you can watch where use
in Zombie Collins you can then start

50
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,489
watching their addresses

51
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:14,160
in the future and see have maybe where
they spent their points

52
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,319
potentially I into

53
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:20,790
the other piece %uh this is the fund
ability

54
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,790
of currency is a very important thing
and fund ability basically just means

55
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:29,349
if Alice months bob gets ten dollars in
cash now spends her ten dollars

56
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:33,680
then the person that she spent the ten
dollars

57
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,790
where doesn't know by virtual looking at
the ten dollars that she stole

58
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,690
right it's not an intrinsic property are
US currency paper currency

59
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,829
to remember where it came from so

60
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:50,900
you have a built-in fund ability to US
currency

61
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:55,459
that I normal people usually can't have

62
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:59,200
on fall up bad banks can and do but

63
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,379
or thats other piece all the talk I

64
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:07,959
so when you get into bitcoins

65
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:10,750
if Alice steals $37 million from her doc

66
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,340
market and then tries to send that to
exchange the exchange can

67
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,389
if somebody says hey Alice

68
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:22,560
stole $37 million from all these
addresses the exchange can look at the

69
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,400
block chain

70
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,250
and say no we don't want a process that
we know its toll and we also know where

71
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,650
you live the police are on the way

72
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:34,620
so that the pro so

73
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,400
beyond that we can think about going
into the fund abilities

74
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,570
I'll we can think about the

75
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:46,270
possibility I'll blacklisting bitcoins

76
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,979
as they flow through an hour let's say
that we know is set up addresses

77
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:53,060
that are used to pay for things that we
don't like

78
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,330
like gambling associate ices popular

79
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:01,970
I am so we can actually say we don't
want to accept a big points from

80
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,600
no institution nice addresses or we want
to build a pic 1 quiet

81
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,690
that doesn't process transactions from
Soto she dies or other gambling sites

82
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:11,740
are people we don't like

83
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:16,750
or whatever so they can be either done
through legislation

84
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,389
or can be done with but that was pushing
and ideology

85
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:25,120
which that last one has actually
happened on

86
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,919
so there's a fairly well known to have
although junior that

87
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:31,960
fairly regularly has been trying to

88
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,410
push any I know you can read that it
will be online everywhere

89
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,750
but basically he continuously tries to
push patches

90
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:43,789
in to you the I into Russian up to pick
one client that a

91
00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:47,780
would blacklist phiri's gambling sites
on the basis that there

92
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,880
then I'll service attacks I

93
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,169
and basically everybody is called
dollars bullshit multiple times

94
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:59,680
continuously but its something that
people are trying to do

95
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,539
actively on assisted short list of the
ones that he tried to blacklist

96
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:09,460
on then there's the bug report when
people realize what he was doing inside

97
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,539
stop it and it was resolved in the pat
was not accepted as the default

98
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,990
configuration into

99
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,020
so

100
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,069
what you run into let's say that was
accepted let's say that that was

101
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:22,870
accepted in a major distribution

102
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:26,159
you run into an issue where one big
point is not

103
00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:30,080
all the one big corner one that point is
better than another pic 1 because its

104
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,770
lineage

105
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:34,479
and that's a problem and undermines the
confidence in the system

106
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,050
all accrued given for the currency so

107
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:43,189
currently incurred a currency systems

108
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:46,800
fund ability is enforced by Anna often
social contract basically by virtue

109
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,400
using a certain configuration of the
software

110
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:56,180
you agree that big ones are going to be
fungible if you happen to use

111
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,550
the modified version the junior made

112
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,740
%uh your bitcoins would not be as
fungible as

113
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,379
other bitcoins when you participate in
our so

114
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:10,569
what I perfer in my systems especially

115
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:14,349
currency cuz it matters a whole lot is
to have

116
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:17,909
fund ability you something like twenty
billion it's that important

117
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:22,879
as fund ability in forced bi mathematics
versus enforced by not a social contract

118
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,770
because mathematics in usually described
to read your email

119
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:32,909
smash scared so

120
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:36,139
let's get into the actual wondering that
is that

121
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:43,139
its heady on sort of my Dark Knight
market I when I keeper

122
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,660
yeah you'll get murdered want it's great

123
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:54,170
so nope talk about a couple techniques

124
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:57,710
I various

125
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,750
anonymizer networks a point mixers

126
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:05,070
and then sold have idea that I thought
using

127
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:08,080
all-points changes which is fairly
straightforward not novel

128
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,320
at all on her somebody else thought of
it before on

129
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:17,200
so using anybody networks basically
there's no reason not to do it

130
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,830
I'm it's very easy to configure a
consequence to look into these

131
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:24,500
I but they don't anonymized your
transaction history

132
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,400
on the block Jane they will anonymizer
source IP address remember back to

133
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,040
YouTube watching .info

134
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,229
shot up where picked up the IP address

135
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:37,290
that IP address that it's picking up is
the first place that it's all that

136
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:42,229
transaction at the network so that may
not be your IP address to begin with but

137
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:45,500
there's really no reason not to do
something like this if you're trying to

138
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,420
launder back

139
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,960
so all your client should be on
anonymity now

140
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,200
so

141
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,870
mixers using going to injured point
other

142
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,970
implantation to that and they do provide
some of his station

143
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:05,830
basically the the way that these are
implemented right now you're trusting

144
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:09,790
mixing services not to keep logs you're
trusting not this to your corinn's

145
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,130
you're trusting them not to collude with
calling owners and the con

146
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:16,140
and context staff which is entire they
have

147
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,200
on exchanges have done

148
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,300
kind of that and I would expect some
mixers might in the future

149
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,610
I and there have been a few there been
an alice is attempts

150
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:31,410
on the SharePoint system which shirt
when developers claim that they fixed

151
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:35,290
I or somebody managed to actually start
linking together transactions with a

152
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,760
very high degree of accuracy in some
cases

153
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,670
it required a large amount of computing
power I am and they weren't really able

154
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,290
to

155
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:47,140
agree they got about fifty to sixty
eight percent

156
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,640
over transactions with some degree of
certainty of linkage

157
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,870
following through the sure going mixing
process I

158
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,200
which if you're worried about getting
murdered is not really enough

159
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,529
on so it typical SharePoint transaction

160
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:07,540
and what these mixers basically do is
remember back to previous transaction we

161
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,029
just had

162
00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:12,810
one input and one output so that's
arbitrary we can have as many outputs

163
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,680
and inputs as we want as long as the
numbers

164
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,740
add up and the not been data only end up
in a sense that

165
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,350
the inputs have to be greater than the
outputs so

166
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:27,839
essentially shared call-in allows users
run by

167
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,570
their turquoise open source but watching
that and four runs and implementation of

168
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,010
it and

169
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:38,110
essentially what they're doing is you
can say I want to mix my coins up

170
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:42,310
so you push them into their system and

171
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:46,740
the wall combine your coins with many
other people's coins

172
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,870
and then send them out to many addresses
and I'll repeat this process many times

173
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:56,779
to intermingle your coins so

174
00:10:56,779 --> 00:11:00,360
currently the system a centralized on

175
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,560
in the SharePoint implementation and

176
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,810
there have been attacks on this in the
past

177
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,830
job going to join said ok it was the
name other

178
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:13,320
I one that on that system

179
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,820
on not at did find some writing

180
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,820
that in the reviews mixing systems can
be

181
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,190
distributed and decentralized in a trust
less sense

182
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:27,829
that is that are resistant to you dial
service tax

183
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:31,209
are men that's basically what G Maxwell
whether

184
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:35,560
Corbett quite diverse was up saying I'll

185
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:41,160
yeah

186
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,089
kinda

187
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:45,959
so basically

188
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:49,240
the are trying to follow saw

189
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,029
be transaction history so that if you're
looking at a

190
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:56,279
transaction log and you have

191
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:59,550
one input and output you can say hey
like I cycling

192
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:03,240
there but if you have a hundred and puts
on a hundred outputs

193
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,029
because the inputs and the outputs
they're not linked

194
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:10,040
by anything intrinsically in a
transaction

195
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:14,120
%uh the transaction just ask to have
more

196
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,209
value in terms of Bigpoint minutes
inputs

197
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:20,870
total thats outputs so

198
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:25,779
you don't know necessarily which inputs
are going to which outputs

199
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:29,459
and when you add a whole bunch
potentially unrelated inputs to

200
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:30,440
transaction

201
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,700
and their associated outputs then you
get kind of

202
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:38,350
muddying the waters fact social what

203
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:42,880
yeah

204
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,650
exactly so

205
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:51,870
into abusing awkward exchanges

206
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,089
I essentially the theory here

207
00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:59,310
is that the goal is to break our
transaction history

208
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:02,650
I so we can do that because

209
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:07,250
we can manipulate all quite changes or
abuse them I asked to do that because by

210
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:07,589
the

211
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:10,970
virtual fact that they keep internal
logs

212
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:14,620
most of their trades they're not
executing trades against the block chain

213
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,970
they're executing trades against their
database more than likely

214
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:21,839
me I so

215
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,520
the idea would be that you would
transfer 50 bitcoins into an all

216
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,350
point exchange you wouldn't sell those
50p coins for

217
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:34,240
all the DOJ goings you wouldn't sell
those for $20 billion like point and

218
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,070
sellers back

219
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:39,029
for forty-nine point five break-point
because I've transaction fees

220
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:43,020
with one saw on so don't let this

221
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,820
exchanges keep a log so basically you're
treating logs on the block chain for

222
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,370
logs

223
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:50,550
exchange I and

224
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:54,170
for large exchange that officer for
large thats

225
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:58,900
on exchanges have been known to you
essentially blacklist coins or freeze

226
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,220
them

227
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,950
as the comment I N

228
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:06,490
sometimes these changes can read I
require very

229
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:10,930
invasive identity verification and

230
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:14,430
the volume of coins that you're trying
to move could be an issue

231
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:18,160
are you getting to there's only so many
coins

232
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,830
there's only like 12 people trying to
sell and if you have thirty million

233
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:22,959
dollars for the big points

234
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,380
you may end up buying up like point in
that causes a very noticeable

235
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:32,300
spike so pulling this together

236
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,540
basically the and thinking about this

237
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:42,540
you if you're planning a bit going heist
plan the laundering process first

238
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,800
because the blocking is forever

239
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,050
so is that and if you're stealing $38
million dollars you probably don't wanna

240
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,320
media lead I F

241
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:57,650
do it are you would be stealing so

242
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:01,750
basically come by in the previous
methods

243
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,410
automate them and tested have

244
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:09,670
scripts that attack on big points common
to all you can interact with

245
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:13,990
big pointy over RPC right I transcript
to talk to and told what to do

246
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:18,020
so in theory you could write a big point
or are you try to Python script that

247
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:22,020
says when I get coins into this wallet
send them on this wall

248
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,470
so let's say the wall you send them onto

249
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:29,990
is the I poindexter the sup

250
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:34,320
and then when they come out there you
write a python script to interact with

251
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,380
almost to the corn mixers are basically

252
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:40,110
web applications so you write a script
to interact with a web application to

253
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:40,610
say

254
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,180
when my a Collier so my point of two

255
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,860
this address which would be the awkward
exchange

256
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:52,310
and then you are a distributor at most
to the operation just have API's for

257
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,380
market trading in

258
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:58,460
margin trading stuff like that so you
are distributors when I get coins coming

259
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,180
into my

260
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:02,580
open exchange push them through all
these currencies

261
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,900
and then send them back to this other
mixer and basically just

262
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:10,810
loop rents for be and try to break your
transaction history as much as possible

263
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:14,970
so and also tested make sure it works

264
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:18,510
regardless

265
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:22,790
if you're planning a theft watch every
object talk you can find

266
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:27,260
Google OPSEC put an end to you too and
watch everything

267
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:31,820
up but the short version is basically
don't take notes on a fucking criminal

268
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:35,080
conspiracy

269
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,270
think like a defender think Lake

270
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:41,960
the drug dealer that gonna like kill you
after you stole his money and his boss

271
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,860
is trying to kill him

272
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:46,540
om and way your risk

273
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:50,910
right is it really worth it this deal
$30 million dollars and worried about

274
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,940
being murdered arrester life so

275
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,830
and you can study mistakes made by other
criminals I actually recently found a

276
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,860
nice or he served us just like 20

277
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:04,230
with a essentially all the cases that
went to court

278
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,020
got pushed through with great deal
descriptions of what the girls actually

279
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:07,579
dead

280
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:11,230
which was interesting and for on what
not to do

281
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,839
and obviously most of those are related
to

282
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:18,180
out pedestrian level crime but still
informant

283
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,230
so

284
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:26,850
looking forward I this is kind of an
issue

285
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:30,560
as we talk about fund ability it's an
issue for purple currency

286
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,610
I going into the future because

287
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:39,370
if we want these currencies to be useful
in sustainable as we're going forward

288
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,940
I as more and more people know about
them they're gonna start

289
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:46,770
getting into these and pushing their
ideology on them and

290
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:51,500
having them be able to you function as a
currency which

291
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,560
fund ability is part of the definition
of something it's considered a currency

292
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,810
the this is something that we have to
care about have to figure out

293
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,580
so they're two projects how to buy the
same people

294
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,880
%uh that I found that look fairly
interesting

295
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,920
and so zero in there

296
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,620
name naming conventions are awful bomb
offer

297
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:15,670
those your point is the first project
your cash is the second project

298
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:20,130
and 0 coins are referenced inside is
your cash project is a different thing

299
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:20,960
than the first

300
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,400
anyway so

301
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,860
protest waited talk about it is 0
calling version 1

302
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:32,070
is a library they can be tact onto a
crypto currency

303
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:37,390
as in at essentially are they publish
white papers and code for this

304
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:40,530
0 hash is a full-blown

305
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:43,540
all quite specification on but

306
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:48,640
they were only published white papers
for this as far as I can hi so

307
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,679
your point is essentially a built

308
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,230
and laundry that you can use inside the
watching without any kind

309
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:59,400
a centralize trust system and

310
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,929
this is fundamentally different then the

311
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:06,310
shared coin system and a totally
different then

312
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:10,900
more than like it well it might actually
be what Jean Maxwell was kinda

313
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,000
thinking about you can really go into
detail I

314
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,730
but basically zero point uses

315
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:22,860
zero-knowledge proofs to mathematically

316
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:27,690
break transaction histories so that you
can

317
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:31,780
this basically takes the form of you say
I wanna buy is your point

318
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:36,750
see you send one back pointing he sent
one back when transaction that size

319
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,010
our advisor when you lose your one pic
point you get 10 points

320
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:43,510
then at some point later you say

321
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,540
I want cash in my eyes your point get my
pic going back

322
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,929
you create another transaction you

323
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:54,210
I when you were actually created years
you're when you get a serial number

324
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:57,290
reveal that serial number and then

325
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:02,710
you basically pushed to zero-knowledge
proofs to the watching now

326
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:06,679
your knowledge proofs are kinda
fascinating because they allow you to

327
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:08,190
make a statement that says

328
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:12,140
this is totally true I totally get it
and that's all you have to say

329
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:16,050
and mathematically you can prove that
the person totally get

330
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:19,050
which blows my mind I don't know I
mathematics works

331
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:23,370
I but I would love some we can explain
that mean bourbon

332
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:28,400
detail I though

333
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,510
there were some problems with this when
they first built

334
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:34,990
the transaction sizes based on their
protocol specification were

335
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:38,760
specs on the just senator literally 1
pick one per 10

336
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:44,850
so you could cash in one big point at a
time 10 point out I

337
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:48,820
the amounts are visible and the
zero-knowledge proof

338
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,910
P so this required was like 35 kilobytes

339
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:55,030
which to commit a thirty-five killed by
transaction

340
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:58,660
walk chain every time somebody buys is
your point is

341
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:03,560
infeasible essentially other normal
transaction sizes and the bites

342
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:10,550
hundreds bite so this an ideal because
if you make some plays you make a system

343
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,770
that is

344
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:15,420
I hard to use essentially then

345
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:18,580
the people that are going to use it are
you there

346
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:23,180
paranoid like us for criminals like us I
guess um

347
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:27,080
so this is not ideal

348
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,380
20 cash

349
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,750
RN got to the story behind your cash

350
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,230
based on watching some other talks is
that they presented there's your point

351
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:41,730
occasion to a conference and after an
aide

352
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:44,780
kinda laid out the issues that they were
having in the size that proves

353
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:48,410
and after the talk was over a couple
guys can often

354
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:51,520
said hey we have some sort of proof that
have really small sizes

355
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,330
what's hawk I answers your cash at so

356
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:00,090
basically they reworked the
underpinnings

357
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:03,280
as they were reworking the underpinnings
the realized

358
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,770
that they didn't really need to make an
addition

359
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:10,810
an add-on for big point for big point
they decided to just go ahead and make a

360
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:11,380
whole

361
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,680
going ON to the other piece about the

362
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:20,360
0.2 library afraid to mention is they
you could not transfers euro coins

363
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,130
to somebody else using the blotch you
had

364
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:27,770
you could by is your point and you could
cash out as your

365
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:31,850
on normal transactions were conducted
back once on

366
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,270
so your cash

367
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:40,760
I is transaction size is a much smaller

368
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:46,250
its bastard validate I they have a fifty
six-page white paper with a hole on a

369
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:46,870
map in it

370
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:50,080
I'll absolutely worth reading %ah

371
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,810
story and so recommend you do the same

372
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:57,120
this fascinating I so

373
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,350
the really cool thing is that the
transaction sources nation and the

374
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,340
amount our entire

375
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:07,010
early hidden in this system and that the
minor fees are the only public pieces in

376
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,430
the transaction so

377
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:13,090
this is the first issue that I found was
your cash project I am

378
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:18,590
I haven't seen any public posting in
terms of relate to the project for

379
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:24,150
a good while I makes me think that it's
either abandoned early round of funding

380
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:29,450
or what have you I and they never
released an echo

381
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:33,760
which I don't quite understand I now

382
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,240
there and at other European Research
Council grant

383
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,210
which is actually with this this
research is

384
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:46,240
was funded by the European Research
Council morning I

385
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,220
or partially alert for so

386
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,910
basically the technical issues

387
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:58,450
was your cash is that the protocol
requires

388
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:02,080
aus being people use it to you trust

389
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:08,070
one person exactly once because as a
feature the math underlying the protocol

390
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:12,570
you have to generate this massive keep
air and by massive I mean the public key

391
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:18,510
is almost a gay arm you have jerry has
master key pair

392
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:22,850
and you have to you trust that whoever
generated

393
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:26,400
or delete the private key and then
release the public key

394
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,680
so what happens if they don't delete

395
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:34,020
private key basically they have the
ability to create

396
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:38,190
0 points if arbitrarily which is a
problem for currency

397
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:41,620
on they do not have the ability to
underarm

398
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:45,130
undermine the anonymity which is good
right but

399
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:50,880
it would basically break the current the
other issue as I was kinda reading

400
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,850
through this

401
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:56,170
and like that I'm not a mathematician I
don't know

402
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:56,679
the

403
00:24:56,679 --> 00:24:59,590
details behind this and it might be a
true trivially

404
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:03,909
solvable problem but based on what I was
reading so basically when you spend is

405
00:25:03,909 --> 00:25:04,889
your point in this

406
00:25:04,889 --> 00:25:09,419
protocol are when you spend is your
point in the zero cash

407
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:13,129
protocol you destroy that 0

408
00:25:13,129 --> 00:25:18,269
right so that's not how big point works
are the only way that pic wines can be

409
00:25:18,269 --> 00:25:19,179
destroyed

410
00:25:19,179 --> 00:25:22,990
is safe you lose your wallet or you send
them to address doesn't exist

411
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:26,029
or things along those lines I am

412
00:25:26,029 --> 00:25:30,440
was your passions are points are points
are actually destroyed every time her

413
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:30,960
spent

414
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,009
and is a limited number is your point so
this is kind of an issue

415
00:25:34,009 --> 00:25:37,399
see because you will eventually in
theory run out

416
00:25:37,399 --> 00:25:42,490
now I don't know if this is as simple as
just breathe is so they basically the

417
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:46,440
keep track of 20 points using a Merkel
tree I which is a giant

418
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:51,019
hash structure and basically I don't
know

419
00:25:51,019 --> 00:25:54,950
if it's just a sample is switching out
that Merkel three for something new and

420
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,809
if they could be built into the protocol

421
00:25:56,809 --> 00:26:01,740
arm but it seem kinda like a fundamental
issue that would eventually come to help

422
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:07,889
so we can probably engineer around these

423
00:26:07,889 --> 00:26:11,669
I you by a computer how much people buy
it

424
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:14,999
watch everybody on the computer when
you're done kinda thing

425
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:19,539
in theory yeah exactly it was about

426
00:26:19,539 --> 00:26:24,379
I and I got saying maybe you can just
switch out the Merkel to regroup and get

427
00:26:24,379 --> 00:26:26,210
around that point amal

428
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:30,230
problem on any would be awesome

429
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:33,539
if some people that were better at math
actually read through that white paper

430
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:37,049
and evaluated what they're trying to do
in the construction is that they've made

431
00:26:37,049 --> 00:26:39,200
from the perspective other attacker

432
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,249
on because while these guys are really
smart as they came up with this stuff

433
00:26:43,249 --> 00:26:46,490
and I understand what the Renault group
are on they're not

434
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:49,749
and testers and I hackers their will
that their

435
00:26:49,749 --> 00:26:53,460
up they're not pin testers probably

436
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:58,730
and it would be good for somebody with
the mindset that's trying to break their

437
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,360
system finally to have a look at it

438
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,450
because if you think about it

439
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:07,630
even people that wanna your euro coins

440
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:11,800
skis yep

441
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,010
yeah I know

442
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:20,850
up yep

443
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:24,410
right now it's my alarm for my caffeine
pills I'll

444
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:31,410
the but anyway

445
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:40,500
even the people that are trying to use
steel

446
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,540
0 points they want those your point have

447
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:47,490
value in the future right they don't
have a fundamental

448
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:51,309
interest in undermining 0 points system

449
00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:55,040
or any crypto currency for that matter
you think about it

450
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,730
I mean bitcoins great in the sense that
people are always try to figure out how

451
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:00,480
to steal them from other people

452
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,980
they're not necessarilly thinking about
how to

453
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:08,350
undermine the system a bit going because
how would that enrich them in any way

454
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:11,360
so that's what people like us

455
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,420
and security researchers really need to
look at the system's evaluate them

456
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:20,220
and try to break them fundamentally not
steal people's coins but fundamentally

457
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,780
destroy the system in such a way that
everything would be worked

458
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:27,130
us because thats how these systems will
eventually potentially fail

459
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:30,690
so that is

460
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:34,200
yeah that's everything so I hope you
guys enjoyed it

461
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:41,200
any questions

462
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:04,039
that is one thing that I would love to
read moreabout

463
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:08,169
arm is that we have had notable back
when tops

464
00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:11,779
in the past I thats basically resort I
think it to your

465
00:29:11,779 --> 00:29:18,779
I'll thats definitely worth looking into
heck

466
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:26,789
rate yeah I I don't now on because one
other

467
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:31,070
one other things about this is that as
you

468
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:36,220
as you go further on in time

469
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:40,139
these techniques like abusing all point
exchanges and things like that because

470
00:29:40,139 --> 00:29:43,690
less effective potentially if people

471
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:47,539
get map stole their money they can put
the word out and say hey

472
00:29:47,539 --> 00:29:50,970
people store money an awkward exchanges

473
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:54,010
other changes might start reno's or
Saulo

474
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:57,760
mister blacklisting coins so it the

475
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,460
the impression I got in doing this
research is that if your gonna wander

476
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,080
coins

477
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:05,310
do it right now play do it as soon as
you steal

478
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:09,770
I so yeah I don't know if they if they
haven't started laundering that already

479
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:10,990
I don't know what their plan is
