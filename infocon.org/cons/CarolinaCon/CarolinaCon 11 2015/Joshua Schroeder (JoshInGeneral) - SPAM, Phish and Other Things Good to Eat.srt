23
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,100
though there's actually a comic called

are the with fam family on forfeited

34
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,659
commercial e-mail to a large group
number address

35
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,289
originally came from the market I don't
get are talking about

36
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:02,850
fam fam family and fam on where they had
anti-family every single thing on the

37
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:03,440
back with many

38
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,269
I was written to be used in 1994 on and
it comes from

39
00:02:08,269 --> 00:02:11,739
the word a by ham which is FPN

40
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:18,100
a.m. stamp together and as we know
everyone doesn't like

41
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,040
her the fishing weather in fishing

42
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,170
and family so fishing is the act
defrauding them one other fine

43
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:30,440
financial online information as posing
as a legitimate company

44
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,030
I come from inordinate word fishing so
reeling Ronna getting your fish

45
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:39,030
saying that on and then also the word
freaking which in the olden days with

46
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,640
Ashley

47
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,060
defrauding phone company in order to
make long distance phone calls for free

48
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,310
calls and I'll see him locks red box on

49
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,850
by hot all those things and bring
together a call the EPA

50
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:55,730
fishing word I'm as you can see in quite
so what exactly is

51
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,329
families fishing from our example find
happiness that

52
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:02,470
as interpretation by myself I would say
that

53
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,459
girls getting webcam its family sent a
mass number people

54
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:09,790
the fishing is a nine-year transfer
they're trying to get money I

55
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,239
you I'm you know some shipper former
pitcher I heard

56
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:16,400
may share financial information on

57
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,060
the day getting larger it's probably a
phishing and spam

58
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,060
think anything to a large number of
people and they're hoping that you're

59
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,510
going to buy the pill online and they're
probably gonna be so our polls or

60
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:32,629
you never know everything all there's
Andy are mission move on on a girls name

61
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:36,980
mostly us I try to pretend I ran
together in order to tally

62
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,930
group different spamming campaign
campaign to see how they

63
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,739
corley and and how they might different
for the first time I talk about is like

64
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:45,060
the

65
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,500
user our group where you had
spearfishing

66
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,260
spearfishing is actually sending to a
tard user I may be

67
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:56,579
CEO of a company or particular system
admin or maybe a group of people

68
00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:00,459
so all this is a man's or the people
that re: charger

69
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:04,000
you running a certain portion that would
be one at heart on

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,400
some other combinations that can be used
to that is called units bass fishing

71
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,480
I have session hijacking and Manal
attack

72
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,190
what would happen is is on for example
there are BTP routes which isn't clear

73
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,070
the way that

74
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,079
on internet is send over the Internet

75
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,210
from mascot nance and various different
countries on

76
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,330
and there have been instances where
major corporations and

77
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,330
major companies I have been contacted by

78
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:33,370
one company up to you actually grab this
information every

79
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,440
there this is where China had a company
that way

80
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,770
essentially my attorney enough and so

81
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:43,060
what could happen is their mind during
all your traffic on

82
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,630
and they would want to US Bank campaign
they want to see for example

83
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:50,470
you now i win B-thirty contributor
locking anti

84
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,900
LinkedIn or Facebook or you know some
financial institution

85
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,970
live with and a your fishing campaign
watch the traffic

86
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,949
grab information and move on with their
attack on

87
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:05,349
and and through that they can eventually
get your username/password

88
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:08,470
through the session hijacking I'm with
him and all attack

89
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:15,080
make than and as Halle or confusing they
have I'm ones that are also

90
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:20,240
fishing and spamming I'm so never I said
that there might be a group

91
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,729
a users that our satellite my have

92
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:25,819
thing called whaling which is
essentially set to sea level tickets a

93
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:26,159
year

94
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:30,129
as though your CEO your seat yet though
all might get a group

95
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:34,180
email that are trying to get them to log
in you may be there may on a fake

96
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:34,819
website

97
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:37,830
at City they can read that that would be
spamming

98
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:41,240
that the group but then it off a fishing
cuz you're trying to get

99
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,509
financial information both individual on
might also have an hour Bay

100
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:48,589
I'm kinase any fierer

101
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:52,189
as you're OK on the of that warning all
tax per cent are you trying to get

102
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:54,039
people to come to a certain website

103
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:57,309
and that website has an expert on it
that would actually allow you to get

104
00:05:57,309 --> 00:06:01,659
into their system and they have the
Nigerian friend send out a large for

105
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:02,159
people

106
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:05,960
game plan operation I'm and that they
clogged so

107
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,789
some time will say hey you have any act
the UPS long injury PF account

108
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:13,219
and they try to get that a lot and that
out too large for people

109
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:16,960
I'm problems again on and quickly and
the fam side

110
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,279
I'm there are things such as surgeon
optimization fam

111
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,800
so for example you might have happy with
it dot com

112
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,889
and you want this to be on the front
page in Google do what you do is

113
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:27,560
actually take

114
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,759
Google and you see what the search
engine on

115
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:33,959
would be returning as a year of the
global dot com

116
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:37,319
a query happy with it dot com

117
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,649
and yes and that few a particular user
on

118
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:44,759
they click on it thinking it something
else you now a free iPod or whatever

119
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,639
I'm back what I am

120
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,790
Google sees I will come when officers in
its monthly particular

121
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:53,160
and that increases the ranking as well
as you know the other Alex

122
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,720
as well so you can essentially move your
site

123
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,860
up to prime and make people think hey
you know that might be 10,000 people

124
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,639
clicking on this

125
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:06,620
by so it's something important social
mood I a pornographic material

126
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,540
I for graphics I it you subtract one you
also can't come there

127
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:14,970
I'm it spam ok on also

128
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,970
and we'll talk a little bit later me on
this with no i subscribe

129
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:22,210
that you're going over to me on campus
crackdown on that I can also be

130
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,930
concerts fan you can get off that list
on and family

131
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:29,740
press meet other the mixes in like a
little campaign where people are just

132
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,380
spamming

133
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,410
thankful for this candidate war on

134
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,900

you something saying

135
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,979

136
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:42,080

137
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,759
and awful for him and it's not
necessarily the goal is to you

138
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:50,360
actually quite on something is trying to
be mean that person

139
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,340
and they're just trying to get the you
feeling and

140
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,659
your mine in sight no associated with
that

141
00:07:57,659 --> 00:08:01,969
so medium that which fam can go through

one throwing up here on YouTube where

147
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:24,800
essentially will say hey to YouTube
videos been taken down on this search

148
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,250
and receive the actual video

149
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:31,330
videos not actually been taken down it
actually is banning

150
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:34,750
you know attacking are trying to click
on a link

151
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:39,510

there with the can-spam Act I don't know
where they come up with the acronyms

154
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,490
but thankfully and I for but we're
together make it something that people

155
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:51,500
can remember

156
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,940
over the content than for controlling
the a fall non flow-through pornographic

157
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:01,089
and marketing active 2003 there whatever

158
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:04,709
are so I'm gonna bring it down this
three-part on

159
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:08,110

help you and actual

160
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:11,620
show fewer cases for you know when
you're going looking at legal

161
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,800
information on the way to figure out is
invalid it working

162
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,699
is to look at or cases how the table in
the paper that Lord

163
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:19,310
the end

164
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:23,410
all disclaimer I'm not a lawyer and I
judge I don't have an experienced legal

165
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,990
I just rything and I can interpret them
and i cant put them out there

166
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:30,170
and you guys can re and help me
understand as well

167
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,180
here actually go through with this and
take the time to do it

168
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,620
a lawyer someone actually understands
how to undersell

169
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,660
the first thing a 7702

170
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,650
the US Code 15 potentially said we're
going to find

171
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,850
the on them %uh a commercial electronic
you know

172
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:51,600
essentially that is a promotion with a
good

173
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,520
okay and commercial or promotional a
service or product

174
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,740
so Best Buy sending you message

175
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,830
thank a at this new if his laptop
promotion I did not include the

176
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,860
14 messages that your mother sent you at
a like

177
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,180
her with the you know mailing list in a
graphic that

178
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,839
on it also does not include things like
safe here want your confirmation

179
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,650
purchase so even though you get three
e-mails from Amazon

180
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:20,710
thing hey you know congratulations you
bought two hundred dollar

181
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:25,050
up you know new solid state hard drive
it's not spam

182
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:28,210
they have a reason to thank you that
information because you actually

183
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,110
purchase something from

184
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:33,900
are it can also be a reference to
accompany or a product possible talk

185
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,740
about the fan

186
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,440
but you like third-party companies that
advertise for

187
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,380
other company on back and be a
commercial you know

188
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:46,330
banning campaign well on it also kinda

189
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:50,100
vaguely starts to the fine header
information and how you should not spend

190
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,420
that I'm for things like IP addresses
destination email domain

191
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,740
have to be valid when you're doing
commercial thing

192
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,840
or there could be prosecution on

193
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:05,260
like that 77 Syracuse definition 7703 is
prosecution

194
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,940
and 770 is what not to do the seven
there in through

195
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,800
there are three can be prosecuted for
legal we are thinking of

196
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,090
so a stand-down %uh emails on

197
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:19,540
any kinda you know things that you
purchase from on

198
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,040
basically any way to you are RF

199
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,170
email without the consent of the user
adding it to

200
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:29,600
your database is considered a legal
randomly generating

201
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,440
so if you know that the first aimed at
last name is the format they're using at

202
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,420
that organization

203
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,440
you can't just randomly go through 18
and

204
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,540
random last name and defend time the
email

205
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:44,130
at of the legal on you also have to make
sure that

206
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:47,730
the information is out a batter and that
the average high

207
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:52,740
Internet domain is correct you can you
fault information we write and

208
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,890
domain on you can you you know the
setting

209
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:59,260
on a some services offer but if you're
making that

210
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,540
then you can be prosecutable on

211
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:06,800
so and then this particular bill was
also the first one to interviews

212
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,480
reference that span iOS 4.0 graphic
information

213
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,910
it has viruses worms and malicious
Trojan

214
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,300
and such and so that the first time that
there was actually a reference in a

215
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,070
legal sense

216
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,150
that this is Kat what with the fam it's
becoming and and deciding

217
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:25,440
feel either is a progression so no this
is how

218
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,570
for it also says that Department justice
can

219
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,790
al que existing funding this

220
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,270
resources emerge across its parent so
they don't have to set up a new task

221
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:35,910
force

222
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,970
I'm they can if they want to but they
can simply take that

223
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:43,110
what they have and go after spammers
right away others a five-year

224
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:46,780
fine a 35 year in prison %uh

225
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:51,550
sons on that can be levied for spammers
and also sixteen thousand dollars per

226
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,170
and

227
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:56,360
than 200 messages in all spam a lot of
money that you can be out

228
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:02,450
if they are able to prosecute I'll the
Senate and therefore

229
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:06,070
and the interest that I wanna go over
then and one thing on this is because

230
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:10,360
you with the company may be marking it's
important that you read this

231
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,930
because if someone let me something
against you

232
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:17,610
you want to make sure that you're not
doing that because you could be seen as

233
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:18,320
a spammer

234
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,720
prosecuted so the key thing is don't use
fall misleading

235
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,620
header information as i sat re: on the
final destination

236
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,650
I or source information on

237
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,720
you know making sure that you identify
yourself that the company

238
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,910
you're not speaking IP addresses through
like or anything like that on don't use

239
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,440
the such as

240
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,820
summit if you're selling something that
and iPhone

241
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,220
don't say that you're selling and right
products for that you know it

242
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,720
something that not identified a method
to that

243
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,600
the pit your local grocery thing that
you're promoting

244
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,150
yes say their site the recipients
relocated

245
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:58,330
be making a a lifetime's on email that
the very very bottom they have a

246
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,100
physical

247
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,330
now brick-and-mortar store that you can
actually getting dressed

248
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:05,140
or and make sure that that's correct

249
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:09,510
roller on all the telling how to opt out
and you have on route

250
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:12,640
the opt out reply within 10 days may
have

251
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,750
time where you can essentially you know
say hey I'm

252
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,740
doing this I think arafat you have to
respond them within the 10-day window

253
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,290
and also monitor what others are doing
in your behalf so third-party agencies

254
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:26,730
that you outsource your marketing team
to make sure that they're

255
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:29,740
following rule because you could be
liable because you're using your name

256
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,130
like for them the vision loss

257
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,430
those are all the previous ones that
spoke about were

258
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:40,190
for spam on there's nice actually a
definite fishing law

259
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:44,550
on there are some you know different
laws that can be associated with

260
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,300
targeting

261
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,570
fisher's on most notably is the eighteen

262
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:51,850
I US the 2008 code

263
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,740
on that essentially targeting fault
identification information

264
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:00,080
so careful Lee identifying yourself or
you stolen information

265
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,700
in such a reform purchased that now in
August as all that

266
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,700
I'm you're using that then essentially
you could also

267
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,820
a fine the same way is a few are

268
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,860
on grabbing that person's information
and you don't have

269
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,060
recently that for them a credit card
that you have

270
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,920
for me and someone you tricked and very
giving your credit card information

271
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,640
on a credit card at the fall stock and
so you can be prosecuted under this law

272
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,370
on of the transferring that phone
information so you have it stored on a

273
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,480
server and you transfer to your local
machine

274
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,720
the person that rhetoric a local machine
essentially can be liable

275
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,680
I'm of the plaza testing 5 arm or the
documents

276
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,170
essentially allows them to go ahead and
start prosecuting you and the

277
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:45,510
are producing transferring or processing
I'll

278
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:49,240
the making quick so if you have a credit
card maker and you pay the ten thousand

279
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,040
dollars a fifteen thousand dollar

280
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,580
get one

281
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:55,080
connect and you're using for this at
also calls for control you

282
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,070
K on the other thing is any attempt to
do any

283
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:02,350
so eventually kinda 51 on

284
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:06,070
if you're researching and you have to
document on how to do

285
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:09,300
banning fishing eventually if they had
other cause

286
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,960
you know they can rely on and under the
no probable cause that you were trying

287
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,290
to

288
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:17,080
to figure out is banning trying to
figure out how you credit card fraud

289
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,140
rebuild you know think like that

290
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:27,100
got a question a rare the question was

291
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,940
what if you were doing at the training
exercise are doing with the permission

292
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,930
of the manor

293
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:34,920
it is very day and as the problem with
possession of their not a definite

294
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:41,920
1 target the passing of got a question
or an integer

295
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,690
so from what I've researched it back to
the person that did it

296
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:04,430
it's not the hosting company as long as
they respond and take

297
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:07,950
good action in order to remove that
information so you were

298
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:11,200
you know essentially had office ripping
rescue and action

299
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,650
at that posted on your hosting rider or
you are hosting provider in other cell

300
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:19,150
and you had quiet doing that it when
someone says hey

301
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:24,530
at used I hosting dot com on actually
bring us to our next point on

302
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:28,690
hey that's being hosted there you take a
good action in order to remove that

303
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,920
I'm not seeing you is being liable on

304
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,020
and that that from what i've seen and in
the research that

305
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,140
though i'm glad you asked a question it

306
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,920
on so essentially what you can do a
lifetime no into the who is data

307
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,340
and you can look at it domain and you
can see that there's a

308
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,740
use their security on and then there
might be

309
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,930
some other admin now and you are

310
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:55,670
you know able to email though and those
should be respon-

311
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:59,350
even with the who is a privacy thing
what they do is a proxy that

312
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:02,480
email to someone and then

313
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,080
they can take care getting at spanner
fishing campaign

314
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,549
for new our that dole then yes that
would be up to the hosting provider

315
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:13,910
the band themselves for wide such

316
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:18,650
on you with individuals can also report
this to the FEC as we know it government

317
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,000
agencies I don't know the

318
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,340
you know how well this works on it fall
campaign they may not taken

319
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:29,130
action on at the bear campaign anything
all major port

320
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:33,290
might be helpful on forgetting

321
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:37,150
fam on your phone others actually really
cool thing that you can do 77

322
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:40,740
26 I most carriers will happen is
essentially

323
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,980
before the message that I'll send you a
text message back

324
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,440
say what was the number that you receive
this on you take that and and I'll put

325
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,530
in their spanned a

326
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:52,030
and I'll actually block that number from
an hour on

327
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,559
that something that it come about
actually pretty

328
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:59,350
you know on probably any more useful
than Union City

329
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:03,130
on of the earthing you can check your
local laws

330
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:06,500
other local author started arising for
this

331
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,059
and that might actually help you on that
being said

332
00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:13,850
moving on to you like international stop
and and

333
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:17,010
a prosecutor on

334
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:20,450
that being fed there have been some
cases for you actually have been

335
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,280
prosecuted

336
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,470
other than this particular case there
was a Russian individual that was

337
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,220
responsible

338
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,149
or a third what the FBI categorized

339
00:19:28,149 --> 00:19:31,590
spam messages on famous oleg

340
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:37,620
and they caught him back in sorry I
think 2009

341
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:41,779
essentially and they they said that they
were going to prosecute him under the

342
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:46,309
I can fam that being that his ordon

343
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:49,559
and I whereabouts were quickly

344
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,779
and now yeah and

345
00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:56,250
at happened a though another individual

346
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,330
Davis walkin of I was

347
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:03,299
prosecuted under up a well

348
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:06,500
up though essentially he was using AOL

349
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,809
a messaging interface in order to do
spamming they offer prosecuted and

350
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:13,889
under the fan and an act as well I'm

351
00:20:13,889 --> 00:20:17,090
the have disappeared as well cell

352
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:21,750
I but they were able to successfully get
wellpoint eight million injunction

353
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,059
though each's be individual

354
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:29,620
campaign he was getting essentially 500
thousand dollars a day

355
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,960
I energy you know campaign

356
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,960
how much you miss me that's very
impressive on

357
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,919
Eddie Davidson with an active spammer I
he created a whole

358
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,750
company around spamming from 2000 to UNT

359
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:47,630
2007 II he however with Abel

360
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:51,480
to get caught and with received a
21-month on

361
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,710
and two hundred thousand dollar fine for
so

362
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:58,090
it working by you know

363
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,769
it is gotta be something that they're
gonna wanna actually prosecute

364
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:02,390
and

365
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:07,000
has a big enough volume to make it at
work while I think that there's actually

366
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,480
individuals are taking their

367
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,090
a spam and into their own hands heard

368
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:15,650
rescue so 419 eater dot com

369
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:20,060
essentially a family whether play the
target ninety re Nigerian no English

370
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,260
I'm but not very well as you can see in
these

371
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:27,460
photos I they eventually tricked them
into you

372
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,260
sending these pictures with the promise
that they would actually send the money

373
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,450
this one here

374
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:35,710
is a gentleman and a KKK uniform thing I
practice for Tally

375
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:39,330
holding a sheep I and

376
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:43,250
they he sent that picture with the
interpretation that you gonna get

377
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,780
you know that amount of money the same
way that

378
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,880
you know he was expecting you extract
from

379
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,360
individual America other third-and-1
think the coke rule

380
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,880
I would hope that you would get money I
mean it targeted

381
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,510
the 419 Fraud Act that was put in place
in Nigeria

382
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:05,050
that being said I the problem with
Nigeria

383
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,950
that the government and

384
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:10,410
Nigerian central bank is actually
involved in the scam

385
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:13,630
so they're making money off it so it
doesn't always really get prosecuted

386
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:17,800
by I get out in time that there was any
website at a lot of stuff on there

387
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:22,110
I don't normally how much it actually
hell are but it doesnt bear

388
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:25,480
spammers and there are some things on
actually buy news that have gone through

389
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,110
and they found

390
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:29,320
spammers and interview people that do
that and

391
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,290
really embarrass them pretty well um

392
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:36,650
moving on to a more technical things as
far as how you can actually track

393
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:37,600
spammers and

394
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,100
either help your sensors or or maybe a
few

395
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,470
feel that it something that you can
actually prosecute I'm

396
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:48,510
got from techniques here after the first
thing email headers were going over

397
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:51,800
online us that counters embedded images

398
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,550
I can call home and you know
verification

399
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:59,420
strip with telnet neck at and the author
they can verify the

400
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:03,470
you know actually correct and in of
great using at an iPhone

401
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:07,550
of the really quick on essentially

402
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:11,340
when you sending email using a
particular quite and you're not using

403
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,800
like a web client or something like that
your email

404
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:18,050
is actually transmitting IP address I'm

405
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:21,670
and as you can see here and the header
information this was an email that I

406
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,300
sent

407
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,880
at my IP address this is another email
that I sent from a server

408
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:33,440
in PHP it also has my IP address on
either the particular client that I'd

409
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,940
elected that are you know all wall

410
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,380
the evaporator Outlook Thunderbird was
no

411
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,920
here so on camp you the believing that

412
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,180
might mail in PHP better in class trip

413
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:52,609
and mailed directly from your yessir
money box I'll be blogging

414
00:23:52,609 --> 00:23:55,769
that being said if you are using a GPS
and it is not

415
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:59,149
something related to your organization
where you are track IP address

416
00:23:59,149 --> 00:24:03,219
behind your firewall you wouldn't get
that problem with leakage

417
00:24:03,219 --> 00:24:06,399
thinking with webmail webmail math all
that measure

418
00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:09,739
designing gmail min gmail IP address

419
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:13,039
seen our proxy client so treating poor

420
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:18,229
one on you can actually you know prevent
that from happening I think proxy

421
00:24:18,229 --> 00:24:22,460
offers ample on Mac our 1x you can use
proxy chain

422
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,219
party that or and then all the script
that I was talking about my

423
00:24:26,219 --> 00:24:29,570
male and whatever would at actually go
through it or

424
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:33,200
and anyway master on in of either

425
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,659
an honest bpm taking the same thing
about the change or I just using the

426
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:38,440
proxy setting

427
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,710
better for outlook on anonymous bps

428
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:46,889
I or ipv6 I noticed that on my right and
bone

429
00:24:46,889 --> 00:24:50,479
%ah it actually using ipv6 now ipv6 is

430
00:24:50,479 --> 00:24:54,149
a little more difficult to track ideas
and people that are working on solutions

431
00:24:54,149 --> 00:24:54,989
for that

432
00:24:54,989 --> 00:24:58,789
by it is it is a viable solution on

433
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:01,869
the first that Hannah I actually ran a
campaign

434
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:05,169
for about five years and it will release
the data on

435
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:08,729
because your privacy concerns and
whatnot why I was able to put that in a

436
00:25:08,729 --> 00:25:09,950
signature my email

437
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:13,309
see who was opening a what they were
doing how long they were looking at my

438
00:25:13,309 --> 00:25:13,919
email

439
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,950
for about five years allowing by rating
think on

440
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:21,679
so it's great for analytic rap if you
don't mind your data being

441
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,489
you know sent to them I would be a good
thing for your showing care managers

442
00:25:25,489 --> 00:25:29,619
and thing are here's these people that
are clicking on the link

443
00:25:29,619 --> 00:25:32,869
I'm what have you on you can also

444
00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:36,109
show how long the individual look at the
now

445
00:25:36,109 --> 00:25:40,099
on it also shows how many clicks there
were per day

446
00:25:40,099 --> 00:25:41,929
on

447
00:25:41,929 --> 00:25:45,870
it also shows Country Origin who I think
the for mine it was

448
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:49,769
United States mostly on Arlington area

449
00:25:49,769 --> 00:25:53,600
are you also have Google their little
talk about a minute are Roadrunner com

450
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,350
cather

451
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:57,830
breakdown by the provider I

452
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:01,940
located taken off the trigger you know
thing where your your users are actually

453
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,950
building on the help I'm

454
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:08,350
ok on the other thing

455
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:12,169
is that he likes the breakout and figure
out you know if it knows an IP address

456
00:26:12,169 --> 00:26:12,710
for

457
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:16,320
this particular I was at UNC Charlotte
campus as your

458
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,389
Charlotte IP address says a ever seen or
Caroline Charles

459
00:26:19,389 --> 00:26:23,100
sure the time goes down to the back 330

460
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,149
shows that on a map very very good rapid
you wanna

461
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:30,029
you know put it together all the pretty
easy to put together

462
00:26:30,029 --> 00:26:34,710
just to add project given a name I'll
give you a project URL

463
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:38,260
like invisible tracker and then it
without some code for you

464
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,639
before the fall place in code and then
it

465
00:26:41,639 --> 00:26:45,260
without a doubt though like when the
hell

466
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:49,470
low and the kinda hot mess it's really
really dirty and

467
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:52,510
tracking you don't need have all it and

468
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,539
essentially all you're looking for is
the URL

469
00:26:55,539 --> 00:26:59,779
because in email client they're mostly
gone through about all the JavaScript

470
00:26:59,779 --> 00:27:00,840
you not get that

471
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:05,120
advantage in laka trying to get them
additional stuff there that's not gonna

472
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,029
be relevant you

473
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:10,950
the one thing I found it you can just
take that image tag the tickets you

474
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:15,470
copy that output gmail I'm we're just
building image tag yourself

475
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:20,529
I you're using some other kinda yes
gripping platform and i actually a

476
00:27:20,529 --> 00:27:23,090
little later that I'll show you guys on
how to do this yourself

477
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:26,429
but I get you throw that in there

478
00:27:26,429 --> 00:27:29,760
and it'll hit a the server and you'll
get your alley

479
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,659
for this particular example here

480
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:35,190
on one thing no

481
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:38,650
that in most cases gmail hotmail and

482
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:41,710
I think ya who is now actually doing are
they actually

483
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:44,840
proxy all the images so what that means
is that the

484
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,630
here you have people that proxy in the
IP address and do a dot com

485
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:51,630
so you're not gonna get the actual IP
address I'll

486
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,770
the actual user a the rapid

487
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:57,970
other figuring out your Europe they
opened it and that's what Michael

488
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:02,600
done it figure that out on though here's
an example me opening in

489
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,870
gmail that being said if they were using
Thunderbird

490
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:09,210
I'm out or Outlook or whatever quite law

491
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:13,000
you will get the IP address because that
the image tag

492
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,590
directly calling from the client to the
server and ongoing

493
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:20,040
so it essentially

494
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,240
know your fireman know who you're
targeting new Witcher

495
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,030
what you're going after on now being fed

496
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:30,350
I told you guys I ran for five years
didn't get it acted

497
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:34,690
eventually I want my friend said
acknowledged tough that the entire year

498
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:39,010
your email why a while you know
potentially here at I i sat at that

499
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:39,410
point

500
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:43,940
here ahead all-american

501
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:48,840
you know it work five years on and
everything you can do if you're trying

502
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,330
to get that

503
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:53,710
is you can embed it in Word document
direct out that he is the object

504
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:58,120
he on it will actually no call out

505
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,250
on and he'll call server

506
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:04,860
and you get like this though the one at
the very bottom

507
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:08,250
is when I first made the object one of
the top

508
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:12,380
is Microsoft Office then discovery

509
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:15,670
unknown on but that outlook a

510
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,920
object that the Microsoft Word calling
out though

511
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,020
like the Microsoft Office suite with you
know

512
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,290
calling out at

513
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:26,460
user-agent: it figures out the that on
that's why

514
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:30,140
for IE 11 because Microsoft I E

515
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,190
they are picking it up thing

516
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:37,070
to read in when calling out your

517
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:40,960
after and whether this works just for
you guys that don't understand

518
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,930
exactly what's going on here on
essentially

519
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:48,170
you have reached him now where you had
your

520
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:52,090
web page on or your distraught taxing

521
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,340
when you in bed image tag any now
actually call

522
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:58,640
to the direct server and that server is
now making

523
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,210
communication with your computer cell
I'm with the exception

524
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:05,410
Google so that's why we can actually

525
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:08,550
get this information and understand what
people are doing

526
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:11,670
with the now on

527
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:15,520
though another another trick that I
found out well that you can use

528
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,820
up certain airco an hour to figure out

529
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:23,050
I what a valid e-mail on so

530
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:27,780
you can I do see a neck at work Alma but
there's NW tools that is actually bill

531
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:31,490
script around doing on Flickr trying to
validate

532
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:34,830
you know what what emails her are
actually correct

533
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:38,810
are you can just put it in there go and
that it will show

534
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:42,850
you know a okay email ballot invalid
email

535
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:46,510
wealthy like rejected host rejected
Thunder

536
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:50,460
on depending on how they that nurtured
you

537
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:54,780
word and a valid a who you're sending
you I'll

538
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:58,280
on the air thing to do that there's no
authentication

539
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,710
on the server on this would be the way
that you would go through

540
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:05,530
actually send something as if you were
one other people in

541
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,310
you can telnet into the server you can
issue the command

542
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:13,150
you were I user sending S&P

543
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:16,200
request authenticate at that user

544
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,120
and then and for this was something that
was happening UN txt I was able to

545
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,680
actually

546
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:24,050
authenticate as one of my professors an
email

547
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:29,590
they suspect that I'm causing it but
there are many theories on the Internet

548
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:33,310
thought do this allied hoppin

549
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:36,370
and send as as an individual are the
company

550
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:42,060
something a try Anthony I'm gonna hop
over and she got the demo

551
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:45,430
a tool that I wrote that essentially
packages the image tagging out

552
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:50,130
and also allows you to be able to figure
out even on Gmail Hotmail

553
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:53,870
did the user actually open the email
other call

554
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:57,080
going fishing hopefully

555
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,680
day alright cool I'll

556
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:07,680
yes that okay

557
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:10,370
bar

558
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:12,920
more pills more pills here

559
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:17,720
or

560
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,910
are

561
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:24,970
cool art so

562
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:28,200
what essentially this is I'm hurry
through

563
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,370
I isn't that great

564
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:35,370
to tag you can send an email that a a
link tag and

565
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:39,880
image tag and what it's going to do that
gonna script a certain pieces that based

566
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,360
on the email that you're sending

567
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,570
you so that you can figure out who is
actually open me now

568
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:48,870
and who is actually clicking on email
and for this is

569
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:52,270
the goal of this is to be able for you
guys to be able to use this

570
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:56,060
in your organization a row what users
are clicking on

571
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:59,380
and you know maybe them you know

572
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:04,550
discovery yet

573
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:08,250
question was the mentally ill

574
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:12,920
under the weather on so

575
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:16,840
renal scan about what I had a friend of
mine who she is actually does and her

576
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,130
there is a a ruby tool out there that
open

577
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:24,130
on my gonna share anything but

578
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:27,450
simply did not work very well I and then
it was also very hard

579
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:32,280
that up very outdated are sized for your
well when I create something in PHP

580
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,700
and while I just go and open source it
and and let you guys

581
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:40,300
use it lead anywhere you that arterial
disease camp they can figure out what

582
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:40,750
the Reserve

583
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:43,970
clicking on because a lot of companies
that do this for

584
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:44,920
you love them

585
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,660
me but I want something gonna be out
there that and the average consumer

586
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:52,870
other you know contacted you and doesn't
have a lot of money

587
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:56,460
can be able to pick up another on the
help with something that

588
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:00,750
if you guys feel it useful yes complain
to me and say hey this doesn't work well

589
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:03,900
bad you or class on get have

590
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,990
upload it later tonight on and

591
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:11,490
you know it's something that we all can
build together on Anabelle

592
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:14,610
a lot on it will improve as well on
though

593
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:18,169
for the basic concept that is ni put in
just the

594
00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:22,020
email with from that mister smith here
on

595
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:26,090
met at hardware dot com who wanted it to
you

596
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:29,169
apparently theory doesn't

597
00:34:29,169 --> 00:34:34,110
she's having an effect on I was on its
theory

598
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:37,169
a letter for your dollar anyways and you
can send

599
00:34:37,169 --> 00:34:42,410
multiple email on by just putting a
comment so I have

600
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:46,130
gotten down plus one dozens are opposed
to you you can't then

601
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:49,640
I email this is at least tag out

602
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:53,220
love you received as well important
message

603
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:57,390
I can fly today on so I figure out a way
to thank me known

604
00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:00,460
path for the future on for this
particular

605
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:04,130
one wall and from me I can get a

606
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:08,000
random I'm whatever you feel like

607
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,220
and then for the image so when you click
I

608
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:15,600
given air and all these can be edited
I'll be the source code that obviously

609
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:15,950
thing

610
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:20,030
later tonight us and then there's an
admin email:

611
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:23,260
so I'm disgusted in myself does for
simplicity

612
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:27,580
and then you can also do you a
passphrase so what this could be it

613
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:31,100
you had multiple and hazard me why
divide out different campaigns that he

614
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:31,940
wanted to you

615
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:35,810
the accounting department and then you
wanted to you on

616
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:39,130
HR as a separate campaign you can
essentially

617
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:43,310
flying different passphrase is for those
understand Carolina on

618
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:47,470
for here and

619
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:52,590
than I also have use a.m. thing called
fck editor

620
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:56,890
possibly can at images and very sorry
think there's also a temple option here

621
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:57,680
so you can add

622
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,310
HTML coding here and have ray bill
template together

623
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:05,400
and testers I you want to just go ahead
bill was in Tampa with the No would be

624
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,590
useful one recommendation to me I'm
actually implemented yet but was like a

625
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:12,690
on a Outlook mail your mail

626
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:15,970
almost exceeded other one that we're
providing

627
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:19,700
a click on that and sign and on

628
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:23,220
and me you can use a separate site for
the final after that

629
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:26,220
I may actually and one at that

630
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:29,510
features well haven't gone I'm so

631
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:33,000
so as you can see here I selected the
UPS template essentially says that

632
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,990
there's a UPS package three to pick up

633
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:38,190
in the click here nor confirm the pickup
because it's gonna be them back

634
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:42,050
and I but some random data in here for

635
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:49,050
ending at on of than the mail

636
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:58,130
okay call and it gives you a full report
though it says all rights I sent an

637
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:58,789

itself

653
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:08,160
still got a clip view images in order to
get that to work

654
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,950
on I feel

655
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:17,300
right by I so when I click it

656
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:20,380
it shows an air thank for been

657
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:23,859
can't you know that and he has to modify
this as such but

658
00:38:23,859 --> 00:38:27,750
the strip straight up patty a trip is
that

659
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:31,160
user think that oh well there's a
problem Howard

660
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,849
whatever on go back to the site

661
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:38,300
and we go

662
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,910
you result will be explored in CST put
in the key

663
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:47,440
and now you can see that

664
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,530
at 740 I

665
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:53,550
essentially user click on

666
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:57,670
the link and also you the link say see
the cool and it rocky right there

667
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:01,020
hear the call thing though it actually

668
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:05,060
md5 the email and for each

669
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:09,020
individual person that click on the
email you now know

670
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:13,359
who clicked on because it has an actual
tax socially

671
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:17,750
come back over you now on

672
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:21,420
down here at the bottom you'll notice
that

673
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:25,500
as equals two that a remember to I

674
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:29,030
and then we also have md5 for some other
things

675
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:33,530
here and then also a capsid designating

676
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:36,970
the actual pack up the campaign

677
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:40,210
with that doing is instead of just
saying

678
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:43,460
who click on the email or who you this
email

679
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,630
it actually targeting it to the end

680
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:48,950
jewel person the Senate now you know

681
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:51,970
are you there someone so that so

682
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:55,869
on I think that md5 don't really mean a
lot to us right

683
00:39:55,869 --> 00:39:59,009
on we've got a we've got to have some
way equipping

684
00:39:59,009 --> 00:40:02,720
so what you do is I

685
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:09,720
because you don't want to leave this on
the server I've create a Python script

686
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:15,180
as long as you know you know the URL I
thank you

687
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:20,130
you

688
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:23,299
essentially but then ending enough I'll

689
00:40:23,299 --> 00:40:26,490
we have that in general

690
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:29,740
one to and I create

691
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:33,089
is all txt

692
00:40:33,089 --> 00:40:37,440
put in my result I got no answer and
hopefully

693
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,670
this work correctly we'll all

694
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:43,849
go ahead and clean

695
00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:47,990
the input for the email us and then
we'll have a log file

696
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:52,359

698
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:59,269
the that there were

699
00:40:59,269 --> 00:41:03,289
a particular email

700
00:41:03,289 --> 00:41:06,880
ya general 5 but 5

701
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,200

702
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,530
on throughout a the the ones that I'm

703
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:16,599

in order to to do the

715
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:05,010
Nigerian Fisher so essentially what I
did

716
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:09,400
I made a custom campaign and the before
I britain at War I was on my

717
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,930
x-box online I'd gotten over Black
Friday and I was tryna make a little

718
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:14,670
extra money

719
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:18,730
on units on on Craigslist so

720
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:21,940
as name you probably know years Nigerian
that right

721
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:25,130
any other thing great I am

722
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:28,790
so I gotta hit up by this Nigerian

723
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:32,510
he was like hey now I you know is the

724
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:36,010

simply that India

726
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:43,130
and the message so he says

727
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:47,089
alright well go and buy it and
understand you actually hundred dollars

728
00:42:47,089 --> 00:42:48,430
because I have a friend

729
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:52,290
I'm going to be funny to another country
that other arm acclimated

730
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:56,140
I as like thumbs up so

731
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,770
on you know I play along you know he
says OK at can be

732
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:02,970
UPS and I them through Pay Pal on

733
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:07,880
can be you confirmed we know once you
you pay for the shipping I'm gonna know

734
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,750
and then

735
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:13,540
in all going but the other four dollar
now so I get this email

736
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:17,590
it was really interesting because the
email actually loaded the images right

737
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:18,070
away

738
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:22,340
on my guess is because it was using them
care proxy

739
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:25,590
through Google II don't quite understand
why

740
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:29,340
I am by it look pretty special I mean

741
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:32,530
everything at the table top images

742
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:35,630
you know confirmed

743
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:41,220
pretty well written on but then it has
things as papon whole

744
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:45,490
their payment on hold sorry and the
century thing that

745
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:48,550
you know I need to put money and I need
conaway

746
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:52,200
they actually give me a real link for
paying for the shipping

747
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,210
so unique that

748
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:58,960
real information or wherever you can be
picking up

749
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,820
so I'm like alright well let me see if I
can get him to click on a link

750
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:06,580
your text message so essentially crazy

751
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:10,780
some more thing to what I did and my log
yup

752
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:13,900
and I put it on Dropbox and I put an
iframe

753
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:17,550
on Dropbox and so intensely there's an
iframe

754
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:21,190
that hit a you know burner server that
I'd

755
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:24,370
that up you know PHP 11 hosting

756
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:27,450
thing whatever and I'm and that it in
the Dropbox

757
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:30,490
the handling ham how much trouble
getting payment or

758
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:33,880
new take a look at and I essentially
clicked on a link

759
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,450
the newest real paper I'll I did the
right click inspect element

760
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:41,430
changed all the addresses so wasn't my
actual pay pal information

761
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:46,130
and made it look really real the katana
and

762
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:48,380
you know if this is essentially I what I
thought

763
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:51,200
and what it what it look like and
there's the code right there 3

764
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,160
pick up a and I created net 54

765
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:59,110
though it would kathy Anderson and

766
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:03,170
here's interface for that on

767
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:06,240
and ISO through these were the feel that
I was interested in

768
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,680
so the electronic like his IP address
any kind either agent information

769
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:16,200
on and where he come from a

770
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:20,870
so I created another script email me if
he is a

771
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:23,930
hit happen but that was right there

772
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:27,230
together night me now

773
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:31,330
40 well on and so I was able to get his
IP address

774
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:36,110
and and usury through that I'm as i
three doing doing

775
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:40,270
and I found that he was on his camera

776
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:43,980
of them had received an email from him
as well same IP address

777
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:49,170
I I found out that the honey net project
where it had also found him as well

778
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:54,220
and I also found out that he had logged
into this African .cc with PHP shop

779
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:57,260
and PHP shell had been archived by
Google

780
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:01,000
so that I can actually see him long into
it under the

781
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,300
up essentially nets that option on the
PSP Cell

782
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:07,920
K so kinda

783
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,210
interesting situation but is more
research

784
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:15,070
on I found out that I Peterson you were
using actually for

785
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:19,060
a mobile phone provider in Nigeria

786
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:22,060
are located in this general location

787
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:26,620
I found for more information other
people have been receiving a lot of it

788
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:31,790
from the same IP address on here the
information from the

789
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:35,000
PHP healthy be wary actually

790
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,960
sending mail on

791
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,030
like and that's that thing

792
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:44,950
and I sir do more research and so what I
found was

793
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:48,520
that Nigeria the use phone for a lot of
things

794
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:52,260
and on the form that they actually use

795
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:57,490
they post the entire I peter so if you
were able to track

796
00:46:57,490 --> 00:47:01,320
an individual down at the right time

797
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:04,690
and they were posting at the same time
you can essentially tracked them down

798
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:08,270
they would have their facebook
information on the site as well

799
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:12,000
because they're trying to get much
revenue and then you can you call

800
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,040
on Asian as well so here here's the
problem

801
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,760
where break so a lot of it was all
information

802
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:22,490
on I was actually able to target him but
i just want to see guys

803
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:26,570
how you know the this kind word and if
you have any information

804
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:29,720
you know and it lined up correctly you
could go through

805
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:33,580
and and do it and possibly fine I

806
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:37,020
so i win I wasn't lucky but I was able
to you know find some ramen

807
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,760
I am the the general deductions that I
came to

808
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,839
was that this is probably someone

809
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:47,250
operating kinda like a a small like
Nigerian spamming

810
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:51,140
company I'm because there is other
people that had different profile

811
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:56,619
that same IP address or the IP addresses
be recycled for the company

812
00:47:56,619 --> 00:47:59,780
on and they have certain block

813
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:03,570
and other people were getting that
posting online they were actually

814
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:07,330
so those are the died actions that I
can't you

815
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:11,020
when they think they know that
attribution is really hard

816
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:14,650
on by you can still do you

817
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:18,260
certain things and you were able to you
know getting email address

818
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:21,359
getting user-agent: an IP address

819
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,520
you can

820
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:28,460
search online fine confers now

821
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:32,369
you know of course there are there are
ways to turn all the Saw

822
00:48:32,369 --> 00:48:35,770
but I'll me at from it all got the

823
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:39,130
I don't know how we're doing on time
gunner

824
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:43,160
it okay yeah so

825
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:46,579
if they may have a question other have a
question about the to like their

826
00:48:46,579 --> 00:48:53,579
questioner

827
00:49:00,109 --> 00:49:05,130
on know so it's actually calling to yet
so it's going to a PHP file

828
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:09,059
on and the way that I'm getting

829
00:49:09,059 --> 00:49:12,079
around a is not necessarily

830
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:16,939
I'm getting around it per se it's just
that I'm attributing

831
00:49:16,939 --> 00:49:20,930
a certain tag in that image tag so that
I know who clicked

832
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:25,039
and who visited the image so in other
words if they

833
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:28,449
open the Edit open the email and they
don't click view images

834
00:49:28,449 --> 00:49:33,489
I'm not gonna getting though that's
where breakdown on but if they click to

835
00:49:33,489 --> 00:49:34,269
view images

836
00:49:34,269 --> 00:49:39,410
than that image tag is going to make a
call my server which has a PHP file that

837
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:42,939
listening for that and then it'll all
get to a file

838
00:49:42,939 --> 00:49:46,049
and I can get it because there's a on

839
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:49,739
specific tag has an md5 email that I had

840
00:49:49,739 --> 00:49:53,229
and I will log that and and know that
they

841
00:49:53,229 --> 00:50:00,229
you that image that make sense and about

842
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:09,810
ok

843
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:18,710
yes so

844
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:21,730
i've seen semantic worked very well on

845
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:25,520
I I mean there's there's also a beer
cooler which is an option

846
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:30,819
on by I mean I haven't actually been
able to like him all the enterprise

847
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:34,589
pollution on really should have someone

848
00:50:34,589 --> 00:50:37,609
dedicated on your team she be looking at
this

849
00:50:37,609 --> 00:50:42,050
and on there were also some really good
talk Derby Conn

850
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:46,510
a few years back were thankfully on for
many organizations actually have

851
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:50,829
someone on from the fishing users on and
when the call think that I heard

852
00:50:50,829 --> 00:50:54,309
was not necessarily like you're gonna
you know tried a

853
00:50:54,309 --> 00:50:58,920
attack from a technology solution by
attacking for more on the user awareness

854
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:02,890
because you never know when someone from
like a nation-state is gonna try to

855
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:03,950
spear phishing attack

856
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:07,890
be successful so if you can train your
users to question

857
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:12,220
all other e-mail and the way that they
really

858
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:15,400
on now ru

859
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,680
ru ru I bernard other

860
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:22,049
but yes to going back it's essentially
what they'd it was

861
00:51:22,049 --> 00:51:25,799
they would do a free fishing

862
00:51:25,799 --> 00:51:28,829
email saying hey we're gonna be fishing
you on

863
00:51:28,829 --> 00:51:33,549
what I hear the things that you need to
be looking for

864
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:37,170
in an email that would be you know
subject efficient so

865
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:40,619
looking at your headers looking at I'll
incorrectly

866
00:51:40,619 --> 00:51:44,030
you actually request that someone venue
that media

867
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:47,619
on those kind of things and then they
would fish their users

868
00:51:47,619 --> 00:51:50,650
and then they would go back and they
would have a were camping

869
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:53,710
so essentially the users that reported
the fishing

870
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:57,829
on to the security department would give
reward for maybe like

871
00:51:57,829 --> 00:52:01,150
a fifty dollar gift card to Starbucks or
something like that

872
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:06,359
so that would essentially cause the
years on a daily basis to be looking at

873
00:52:06,359 --> 00:52:07,270
things alright

874
00:52:07,270 --> 00:52:10,930
maybe this isn't fishing maybe this is
fishing

875
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:14,059
I should just go ahead report and so
they would it would be aware and they'd

876
00:52:14,059 --> 00:52:16,210
be thinking okay I'm gonna get this
inning

877
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:19,809
time and not really help cut down more
than

878
00:52:19,809 --> 00:52:23,309
you know buying ten thousand dollars or
a hundred thousand dollars worth

879
00:52:23,309 --> 00:52:26,470
ok with that I'm because the end the day
people are

880
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:30,150
gonna be the weakest link on and they're
the ones that are going to make this is

881
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:31,029
and whether they

882
00:52:31,029 --> 00:52:34,190
among the ongoing recording they oh yeah

883
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:38,339
want to get a free iPod and there's
gonna do that on and for manTech does

884
00:52:38,339 --> 00:52:40,150
that ill send you with medicaid hey

885
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:43,980
got a quarantine message and much cuter
share of checking out

886
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:50,980
think they'll go in there a monthly
really where

887
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:55,240
that there

888
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,330
alright very well thank you sir
