22
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,210

23
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,690
idiotic stuff but I can look at him as

00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:40,690
solvers the noun

25
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,830
they're not hindered by lacquer
resources typically

26
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:47,400
money if they have something they need
to do their gonna figure out a way to do

27
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,110
it right

28
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:52,290
yes I'm getting lionize so a homebody
into the stall

29

embrace your rednecks Idaho

30
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:03,180
I give you some encouragement to do that
by the time we finish

31
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:15,720
yeah it better nm if you can do it
without spilling your alcohol than your

32
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,490
skill

33
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:21,310
in either either group right so I did
grow up in Alexander County is a small

34
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:21,910
town

35
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,160
a the population in 2010 with 37,000

36
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,860
when I was growing up there is a race
car driver named Harry game he was

37
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,890
he was some hot stuff yes

38
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:36,180
this is great these are my people

39
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,120
um there was lots of arms mostly cattle
there were some chicken farms and

40
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,580
somehow

41
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,980
farms cotton is a big thing tobacco
issues before the

42
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,720
the lawyers kinda killed RJ reynolds
business model the

43
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,940
that I couldn't find the statistic on
the web but I read it when I was in

44
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,230
college the year I graduated there was a
hundred

45
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:58,460
I'm at a hundred counties in North
Carolina North Carolina are Alexander

46
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,850
County was like 97

47
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,740
out of the 100 North Carolina was
fourteen other the fifty states I got

48
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,300
probably one of the worst education you
can receive

49
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,630
in the entire country so

50
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:15,709
ruling so

51
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:20,630
Bobby mosier was a nickname that was
given to me at my old employer

52
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,989
they were due for round one day I was
complaining about nickname and they were

53
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:25,250
given a roundabout

54
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:29,170
Talladega Nights and I think they
thought I reminded them of

55
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:33,080
a Ricky Bobby and so

56
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,160
they came up with this scheme which is
described at the

57
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,330
fifth bullet point there on how you
arrive at your Bobby you can

58
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,810
you can come up with your own body
basically take a portion of the last

59
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:43,680
thing for sure your

60
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,120
first name is swapping and then attack
Bobby on the front and the nature botany

61
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,120
mind just happen to be really cool it
comes out the body modo

62
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,350
and I'm okay with that we had a guy

63
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:58,470
a his name is Bobby stabber by me know
da by Bugz

64
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,520
and Bobby beam not as cool as Bobby
Mocho

65
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,500
the body part is optional but a

66
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,640
anyway that's how that came about so
what is a redneck

67
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,610
well from words please me

68
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:18,100
country guns

69
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,900
trucks well

70
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,470
in now no

71
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:30,320
dante that yes so yeah

72
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,080
I think a while other while I mean
they're just they like the party they

73
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,950
like to have fun they like their trucks

74
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:40,230
look bourbon left the lab they love the
mic other people laugh and we'll do it

75
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,870
at their own expense sometimes right

76
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:47,660
um it's a hardcore do it yourself added
to they don't

77
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,580
generally like to buy a things the if
they're like I said

78
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,610
rigidly at the trying to solve a problem
money is the limiting factors at all

79
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:58,780
figure out some way to do it without
having the resort money

80
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,610
they love driving in the snow in the
opportunity for people that indigenous

81
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,820
I know this first hand big trucks

82
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:10,240
excessive drinking the excessive public
drinking

83
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,590
excessive group drinking the boulevard
is the usually originate during the

84
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,540
aforementioned

85
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,930
drinking resource-limited

86
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,700
creative problem solvers that's the one
I really want to focus on I think I

87
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,389
think rednecks are creative problem
solvers

88
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:29,400
and fire fire can leave nobody said fire

89
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,669
guns hunting and tattoos

90
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:36,729
so what are some words that are used to
describe hackers

91
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:40,810
at Scott fire

92
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:46,120
duct tape i think is also applicable to
hackers yes I'm sorry and Henry

93
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,560
drinkin I so we go out inquisitive
inventive

94
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,250
of in resource-limited are some
similarities here hardcore do you sell

95
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,740
that it is as a drinking

96
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,170
create a problem solved I had

97
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:04,030
guns tattoos there's a lot of overlap a
lot of overlap and I think that's a good

98
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:04,510
thing

99
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:09,180
um at that hackers are embraced by and
large they i mean is

100
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,300
it I'm anyway this

101
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,200
it a good

102
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,260
they will be the give me about 30
minutes after the talk

103
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,340
haven't posted um so my wife I had her
do that I can't

104
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,790
anything that creative I

105
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:30,570
sarin expert rating media this is this
is where it gets kind

106
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:34,900
the one most most of the focus is on the
area crap that rednecks the rave scene

107
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,270
that fixes style

108
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,200
friend

109
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:43,420
rednecks for paychecks haven't seen
there some search terms you want to do

110
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:43,980
research

111
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,270
after the talk if you're still
interested in this they usually involve

112
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:52,330
near-death exited experiments maybe
unintentional I don't know

113
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:56,330
destruction of private and public
property often

114
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:00,770
is the result and meant to illustrate
how dumb rednecks up I'm

115
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:05,360
I'm intended to illustrate the opposite
so Jeff Foxworthy was the first famous

116
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,310
redneck that I ever remember

117
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:11,240
I'm getting a lot of attention and I'm
not sure what he's doing here

118
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,430
Beverly Hillbillies yes and then I think
about them

119
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:21,750
and she couldn't chanted got this guy
larry the Cable Guy and mater

120
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,770
which my kids love mater i cant I can't
say anything about

121
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:31,410
mater there's a lot of TV shows now on
History Channel A&E TLC

122
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:36,780
several 0 right the there's a big man is
kinda big money is and there's a lot of

123
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,450
interest now

124
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,580
I think it's at the expense of the
rednecks there laughing

125
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,960
red these guys don't honestly I mean
they have made a

126
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,010
absolute fortune on idiotic crap that
they do

127
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,420
beards is also very important yes

128
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:57,310
it's also important in this crowd I see
beer beer beer moonshiners anybody watch

129
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:57,670
this

130
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:01,280
it's a fun show you haven't watched the
should watch it

131
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,840
what i don't understand is there
breaking the law it's recorded on video

132
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,780
they're like they've got it all but the
cops can't it

133
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,680
it is evidence right I don't understand
how they can get away with it and

134
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:12,950
they're

135
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,820
and they're fully admitting what they're
doing there yet we're we're cookin

136
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,050

00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:35,829
they can hardly understand what the same
but he's a great time to listen to

157
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:39,170
I'm he kinda reminds me of somebody else

158
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:43,769
who also happens to be from louisiana

159
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:48,390
here he also happens to be from
Louisiana so

160
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:52,329
about that was mean really like gonna
look at the 10

161
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:55,360
T anyway

162
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,880
honey boo boo I never watch that when I
can say anything much about it and

163
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,380
thought it was

164
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:03,160
anyway she was that

165
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,190
anyway there's something called sled net

166
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,310
because her this this is it's already

167
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:13,940
it's a it's an MTV show

168
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:18,430
and it's Adam alaska's the rednecks are
just reserved to the southeast anymore

169
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,170
we were going global amina

170
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,389
there we got rednecks in Ohio we got him
in alaska

171
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:28,040
this one was new to me I didn't know
this until I started doing research this

172
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,389
show is cool it on Netflix you need to
watch it

173
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:33,620
as call the Rocket City rednecks in the

174
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:39,060
did not come up approval over here this
particular episode they use men Shan

175
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,360
and nitrous oxide to to build a rocket
that they

176
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,329
they launched other the parachute failed
to deploy any

177
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:50,000
in the kinda came down and stuck in the
ground but it at work the very first

178
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,889
episode the bill

179
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:55,660
among a plywood beer cans and PBC they
made a

180
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:59,079
and a bomb blast that go up underneath
the truck to

181
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:02,240
to protect against IED's basically any
word it actually

182
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,959
the the glass in the vehicle then break
so the they all got there he is a

183
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,069
retired rocket scientist an actual
rocket scientist to sign is a rocket

184
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:10,670
scientist

185
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,980
and they're all kinda engineers their I
guess educated rednecks right

186
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:20,100
and

187
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,120
this guy has a cool guy he's a mean he's
known as the almost politically correct

188
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,940
redneck

189
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:29,250
him I could not include any of his
pitchers the stuff this person

190
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:33,839
that discusses 30 but it's good
entertainment I recommend that you go

191
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,800
check it out afterwards almost
politically correct redneck

192
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,120
here the country

193
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,390
hear that

194
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,870
here's the kinda stuff they then red
nixon made fun of for item in this is

195
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,220
the idiotic there are

196
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:53,120
so you got a Pringles can then even look
like a smart idea

197
00:11:53,120 --> 00:12:00,120
to anybody in this room

198
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,650
the yell

199
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:18,759
the

200
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:21,670
it's a way to solve a problem and

201
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:25,470
I don't know what the kids think the
reason right is biking ill daddy is hard

202
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,240
to steer

203
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,009
yeah I got a redneck mention

204
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:37,160
added that was kinda small gonna do you
make it happen again made a harness for

205
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,589
his desktop computer

206
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:41,910
and his CRT monitor and he's walking
around his

207
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:45,110
I guess again that is

208
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:48,199
that is not me yeah

209
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:52,579
I consider them with the area it

210
00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:57,550
a

211
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:02,569
Alan that was a fail so this one
entertains me is not solving a problem

212
00:13:02,569 --> 00:13:03,790
they're just having a good time

213
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:07,970
write them in a pontoon boat out over
and a picnic table and estimator to it

214
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,790
this when this was kinda thing is I
think this is

215
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:18,439
right laziness is what motivates most
them

216
00:13:18,439 --> 00:13:21,899
raising hand who's lazy yes

217
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:24,430
so you're always trying to figure out a
way to get out of doing work this is

218
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,360
genius to me

219
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,790
this is pure genius and say what

220
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:35,790
efficient is this is cool

221
00:13:36,869 --> 00:13:40,429
I've never seen that before as anybody
see them for couple

222
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:44,079
that tractor tires

223
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,239
that's cool that that kinda blows my
mind I can watch that over and over

224
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:54,429
what wes is for right here like right
after the fire it even looks like the

225
00:13:54,429 --> 00:13:55,229
air that

226
00:13:55,229 --> 00:14:02,229
it fills up with their little bit in the
tire

227
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:06,740
don't tell me you never thought about
doing this like if I could just get some

228
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,880
additional or more

229
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,150
I could cut down the time that it takes
the more grass cus I hate long grass

230
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:15,400
take a minute this will take me some
time

231
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:21,170
soldiers folders on the tail light

232
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:24,339
rice so that was good nasa creative not
so cool

233
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:28,839
on that one scale as bad but

234
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,809
the in the state of Florida their anti
smoking campaign and I did campaign

235
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:34,379
they're making a comparison that if you

236
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:39,290
if if if it you get you can buy you can
buy tires for $950 dollars and Bob

237
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:42,360
wanted ever gonna close to nine hundred
ninety dollars so that's that's kind of

238
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,309
clever marketing

239
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:46,569
alright

240
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:50,959
so this one this one is on the idiotic
side but

241
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,230
this is on the entertainers and as
always trying to make his buddies

242
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,290
laughter something right

243
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:59,040
so now this lady wanted bong

244
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,540
the out at home coach

245
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:07,930
they say what do you think you know that
my out man that sucks at least

246
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:14,930
would wanna do that I know this one is
jean is this was the

247
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:19,470
this was odd to me Russian redneck that
in there such a thing existed but this

248
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:19,809
is

249
00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:26,809
this is pretty cool

250
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:31,690
very simple very efficient

251
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:35,460
say that on a work day and again to use
cheap to do

252
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:39,800
so this guy he made an air-conditioned
bedrooms dog

253
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,270
and I was on him in had to say imager I
am to you are

254
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:47,160
imager okay

255
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:52,200
this was on there the one other the top
quotes are the comment was redneck this

256
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,770
is well-designed and clever and

257
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:57,940
it's basically a something at mash and
he's got some time

258
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,100
the CPU fan inside to their knees got

259
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,770
ice inside bottles that brings air into
the the pipe and it calls dog

260
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:10,380
pretty smart the other comment the reply
to this gas and redneck this as well

261
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,480
designing clever was from someone who
identifies as being a redneck and uses

262
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,240
as a redneck

263
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,760
this is usually the case we r stupid or

264
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:23,190
well some of us are stupid and poor and
but I thought

265
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,090
I mean that's that's pretty good
engineering so this is clever and I seen

266
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:27,760
this one before

267
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:33,980
this 10 this was new to me so for all
those that haven't seen in this is Danny

268
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:40,790
there's a second week ago I think they
have two wires running from the

269
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:45,720
about any down to the ground somehow and
and I think they have a rope on the back

270
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,080
its kinda hard to make out with the
resolution on this but

271
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:53,470
they lower the the cast down to the
ground that have a trial

272
00:16:53,470 --> 00:17:00,470
all right into the bed of the truck that
would've ingenious

273
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,380
I so story time

274
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,720
I know a guy's name is class I'll will
say

275
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,780
and this is a attaining the this is a
real person the

276
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,190
is that had a small business basically
doing Woodward and

277
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:16,940
I'm there was a lot of manual labor
involved a lot I'd really like cutting

278
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,240
lot of it into pieces

279
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,870
and he grew up around this is whole life
and he eventually took over the business

280
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:26,069
from the father he dropped out of school
in six grade

281
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:29,290
is like litter I mean this man cannot
read but

282
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:32,310
he was probably when the most ingenious
manza

283
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:35,460
have ever met in my whole life he in the
developing

284
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,690
machines that would cut in israel kinda
falling one step like you feat a blank

285
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:40,800
piece of wood in the one in

286
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,280
out the other end is is a finish
component has all pre-cut

287
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,870
slots and he designed and built these
machines themself there

288
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:51,400
the pneumatically operated the majority
among they would have like

289
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,740
custom saw blades and i was just
fascinated by this man his cannon what

290
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,920
spark me thinking about all this um

291
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,120
illiterate sixth-grade dropout but he
can

292
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,920
you can do amazing engineering feat
loutish quickly

293
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,610
so included rednecks are very inventive
bunch

294
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:16,350
they're extremely creative problem
solvers you guys agree with that

295
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:21,340
yes excellent they don't let the lack of
resources stop them from

296
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,120
from solving the problem that they're
trying to sell yes things don't always

297
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,150
work out as expected as the truck

298
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:31,010
example demonstrated the hey at least
they tried something

299
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,620
if you're not doing something try
something don't worry about being

300
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,210
embarrassed about I mean did

301
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,610
somebody someone is gonna laugh when
other people are gonna think it's cooler

302
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,620
or they're gonna try to

303
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:44,270
I'm and if you're from the south don't
be embarrassed to be a redneck embrace a

304
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:44,770
redneck

305
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,640
the right now can I get a ego

306
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,860
%uh a yesterday

307
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:56,410
I'm so you can become a card-carrying
redneck up on the website card American

308
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,600
