1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,120
the I

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,399
the thank you all very much

3
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:11,400
I am Skyler town I am the security
anthropologists and research scholar at

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,570
the Rhone Institute

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,010
and the talk to them giving today is the
culmination of four years a research

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,600
into the origins block

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,400
arms began when I was attempting to rate
up the history block based on things

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,510
that I had heard from people in my
community

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:29,560
from books that I and ran on security
engineering and in

10
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,730
encyclopedias and whatnot and for some
reason it just hit me didn't seem quite

11
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:34,260
right

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,880
I didn't know where to go from there but
had amazing help from other researchers

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,620
along the way

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,880
so we're going to dig into all that
before we do I would just like to

15
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,200
dedicate the stock

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,660
to re: wells han Fei and Eric Schmidt
all

17
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,030
were my first and finest teachers when I
got involved in all things locks

18
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,079
not be here I for one for

19
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,870
those fellows so when you first start to
look into the history block

20
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,309
you will immediately start finding
references to a four thousand rolled

21
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:05,329
Gyptian lock

22
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:09,479
box reuse as far back as four thousand
years ago in Egypt

23
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,389
you'll find this all over the place so
before we dig

24
00:01:13,389 --> 00:01:17,389
into what the true origins might be some

25
00:01:17,389 --> 00:01:21,069
the evidence around that I think it's
important to understand how we got here

26
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:24,459
to this fact above the four thousand
year old Egyptian lock

27
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:27,899
run talk about the rediscovery

28
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:33,779
I am so von den in was an interesting
dude

29
00:01:33,779 --> 00:01:36,829
he you why as a player or a neat he

30
00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:40,529
you wrote in a bellows he was a
fantastic

31
00:01:40,529 --> 00:01:45,369
I'll illustrator and after and he was
even a diplomat for a while

32
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:49,509
under a couple different things in
France he was stationed in

33
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,709
saying here's burt Russia as the
secretary to the diplomat

34
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:56,759
France there and his service was
described as

35
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,310
he conducted diplomacy in love affairs
concurrently

36
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:03,409
deceiving his mistresses for his masters

37
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:07,009
he was fishing out state secrets in the
most frequented alcoves

38
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:11,300
adaptable discreet and coming in this
extremely difficult role

39
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,950
he made himself liked everywhere and by
everyone

40
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:20,080
and Matt not just for his diplomatic
service but for his entire life

41
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,500
is a perfect way to some the guy up von
den in

42
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,670
not only survived but thrived in

43
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,790
every air a revolutionary France he was
a favorite

44
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:35,080
Louis the 15th he went back into
diplomatic service for louis the

45
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,880
sixteenth

46
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,390
when louis was getting beheaded he
returned to France

47
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,000
even though he had been put on the let's
kill this guy and give his property away

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,540
West

49
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,460
and immediately ingratiated himself to
the reign of terror government

50
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,590
and he was doing at Jinsha v

51
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,480
I the uniforms other civil servants were
going to use in the news

52
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,730
regime and when I love those guys were
getting killed

53
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:02,260
somehow he managed to make the
acquaintance josephine

54
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,750
josephine napoleon's

55
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,780
number one Lee D introduced him

56
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:13,250
napoleon and when the polling went to
Egypt

57
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,110
but wants I'll that this was going to be
the opportunity of a lifetime

58
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:21,390
I'm here to contribute a lot to arts a
lot of art history stuff use in Italy

59
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,450
for a long time

60
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:26,700
when he found out that not only was
Napoleon going to Egypt but napoleon was

61
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,190
gathering his score to serve ons

62
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,959
a group up dozens and dozens of artists

63
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,080
academics scientists psychiatrists

64
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,950
to travel through Egypt with the main
military force in order to you

65
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,610
document all about the culture the art
the antiquities so on and so forth

66
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,870
this wasn't just an attempt to conquer
Egypt

67
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,660
this was an attempt to completely
appropriate all

68
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,530
egypt what's napoleon was particularly
effective about that over the years

69
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:01,410
so the bomb was perhaps getting a little
bit claustrophobic in this large

70
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,500
contingent of other academics when he
was traveling with the main army

71
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:10,140
but he saw his opportunity to split off
from the main army and heading to Upper

72
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,730
Egypt

73
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:13,810
a bridge a pen will explore we'll talk a
little bit about the history that

74
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,419
but the reason the news able to do this
was because

75
00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:23,010
up the Mamluk basins now I would love to
go into an exhaustive history a man like

76
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,419
me are

77
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:28,680
Lee amazing I'm if the short version is

78
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,150
around 900 they you were

79
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,940
the sleeve cast that were

80
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,669
kidnapped from foreign countries and
training to be an elite military force

81
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:42,520
that were given station above the
regular citizens

82
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,870
love that particular Empire about two
hundred years later

83
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,990
they overthrown their rulers

84
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,400
and they some the

85
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,509
had a 400-year Caliphate

86
00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:58,729
I they maintain the slavery system you

87
00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:02,070
couldn't have second generational
property your sons were not able to

88
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,780
acquire

89
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,060
anything but you had built in your
lifetime was just another group slaves

90
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,840
anyway I remarkable good people and I
should cut off their

91
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,830
really willing to go back three
generations for conduct okay our eBay Al

92
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,410
Kabeer revolt against the Ottoman Empire
who had been controlling

93
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:21,410
the man looks and their people for quite
a long time in the process he managed to

94
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:22,490
conquer a huge

95
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:27,880
area unfortunately his act late Muhammad
be abl all the hob immediately just a

96
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,729
couple years later betrays him and
returns everything to the Ottomans

97
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:34,620
then narod Bay in Abraham de

98
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,840
Muhammad they is acolytes forma do on
Brett

99
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,880
so fever he was in charge a I everything

100
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,630
diplomatic everything to do with the
state and affairs finance Beauvoir

101
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:50,510
and the robbers the military leader know
the reason we go all the way back to el

102
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,520
baile Kabeer

103
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,330
was because when he revolted he also
opened up relations with Europe

104
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:00,760
he reignited an interest in Europe in
this area because he brought in traders

105
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,300
that hadn't had access before he brought
in

106
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,560
weaponry and military and Napoleon

107
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,930
when he saw us opportunity set his
sights right on this area

108
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:14,659
as the first step in the ventral plan to
get India and overthrow

109
00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:18,240
the I I British tea company

110
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,050
yeah thank you

111
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,390
I

112
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:27,830
I am and virtually no that work so rob
and he bring him back a

113
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,910
I'm probably as a result in these dual
revolts in the people immediately above

114
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:32,280
them

115
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,460
what they end up doing actually is just
sort of controlling

116
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,470
Egypt and giving

117
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:41,940
lip service to the Ottomans the Ottomans
were getting sick from it and actually

118
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,200
came in an attempted to drive them out

119
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,570
so the bay's briefly separate

120
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:51,830
but by the time the polling arrives they
are in control a backcountry

121
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:55,310
bear ma'am look I

122
00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:00,550
house is in complete control and Egypt
so at the Battle of the pyramids

123
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:06,350
they are destroyed I'm not completely
destroyed him Abraham takes up for the

124
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,590
Sinai Peninsula

125
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,970
and meron baytex of into Upper Egypt

126
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,930
sound a small contingent under

127
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:18,970
Louis the same in July 21st 1798

128
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:23,100
go after a rock band Upper Egypt now at
that time

129
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,230
then was able to follow immediately but
then realizing that there is this new

130
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,910
small contingent that had none of the
other scholars attached to it was going

131
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:37,070
deep into Upper Egypt he the next ran
cigar attached himself to a Justin bill

132
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:37,600
yard

133
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,760
who in November the same here caught up
to the say and they were chasing after a

134
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,580
ride be together

135
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,990
number obey was a guerilla cavalryman
she was just

136
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:51,130
taking our view would camp out for a
while they were on

137
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:55,590
a ridiculous schedule that wasn't gonna
work to Dan's favor but he got to see

138
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:58,100
things that almost no one before him

139
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,540
at least no one from Europe have the
opportunity to see before now there were

140
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,720
some European similar in the Upper Egypt

141
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,030
I'm throughout the seventeen hundred's
there are a few people going in and

142
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:10,050
ratings small travelogues have their
journeys through their

143
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,070
though on reflection in the nineteenth
century scholars looking back at their

144
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,960
work found that there are a lot of
things where

145
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,720
maps were just incorrect illustrations
they got back in descriptions they got

146
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,620
back we're

147
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,760
if not suspect at least somewhat
amateurish

148
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,870
I'm there were people doing great work
there are some amazing things that came

149
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,390
out of the movies goes efforts

150
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:32,209
but i just want to make it clear that
though there were people there before

151
00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:34,099
what denim winds up doing is

152
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:38,659
is on a completely other level so down
was brought

153
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:43,169
into this not just for his academic
prowess but also because he was such a

154
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:43,419
good

155
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:46,790
illustrator and they wanted somebody out
there trying the battlefields

156
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,660
you know the Gloria France trying the
military so on and so forth

157
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:55,040
but more and more his concerns or with
the actual antiquities

158
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,060
I'll be gypped Misar of etchings
abandons

159
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:02,470
now as I was saying Denon was traveling
with the force that was picking off

160
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,139
after a

161
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:07,569
guerrilla cavalry force they were
traveling all over the place

162
00:09:07,569 --> 00:09:10,720
they would sometimes camp out for days
in the middle of the desert with nothing

163
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,029
to look at they would sometimes be
rolling right past amazing

164
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:18,410
artifacts an amazing temples without
than in being able to stop for a second

165
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:22,060
so for quite a while they were camped
out near Ella Rob

166
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:26,410
and then insisted the saying hey
whatever happens

167
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:31,579
I need to get like a one-mile that way
at some point with you guys

168
00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:35,540
having my back so I can try are these
monuments Bob want to say said don't

169
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,399
worry about it

170
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,920
soon as bill your gets banged we're
gonna crash in Iran but at a lower

171
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,240
and then a couple weeks later they head
out

172
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,449
they'd never went to Allah robber and
they are riding by

173
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:53,740
these two massive monuments and then
recounts this

174
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:57,360
desi dared not look me in the face

175
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,459
if I am killed two morrow said I to him

176
00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:04,310
my ghost will be always hunting you
repeating in your years

177
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:09,340
Rob I

178
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,290
so dem stand up there wasn't

179
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:14,950
the best but we managed to get
accomplished was fantastic and

180
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:18,170
though this is one of my favorite
anecdotes from his travelogue

181
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:23,490
be soldiers were incredibly devoted to
the work that he was trying to do as

182
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,630
much as they could be

183
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:28,150
when they did arrive to a site soldiers
would get on their knees and allow them

184
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,360
to use their backs is drawing boards

185
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,280
they would stand above him just a shade
him from the Sun so that he can get his

186
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:34,950
work done

187
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,990
so they were very committed to what he's
trying to do but this

188
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:44,990
was a difficult situation for both
parties so in July 1799 this is

189
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:50,110
the we care about as as lock people they
arrive at Karnak

190
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,100
now panic is a massive temple will look
at scale a bit

191
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,840
I am ball when he arrives he had he had

192
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,130
done some work there before any

193
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:05,140
you takes the opportunity to introduce
the new soldiers that is with two

194
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,600
some what he sees around him he takes
the opportunity to look around for new

195
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,930
interesting things

196
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:13,870
he describes on a wall

197
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:17,230
seeing an offering of 20 bill asks

198
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:20,810
at gate for a town

199
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:24,570
and that gay

200
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:29,830
as his translator Arthur et conseils was
shot by exactly the same kind of wooden

201
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,770
bolts that are present meet you sir

202
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:35,000
but when you actually look back at the
original French

203
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,170
he wasn't using the word bolt

204
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:41,840
that word is walk

205
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,510
then was seeing a walk on that wall

206
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:48,860
now seeing the walks in the oval Esks

207
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,290
seeing v the door dan says

208
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:56,090
we can infer from this cultures that
Opalesque since such kind monuments with

209
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,590
votive offerings of princes and other
great personages in the even less

210
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,880
monumental objects

211
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,120
such as doors were also pious offerings

212
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,060
and then a can drops

213
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,420
one of the most beautiful sentence is
this guy ever says this isn't in the

214
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:19,420
original the the English translation and
that such utilitarian objects

215
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,190
are transmitted by a tradition that runs
through

216
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:27,350
all revolutions have nations that this
law

217
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:31,040
that he is seeing around him in use

218
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,060
in Egyptian huts in the small
communities in he was seeing

219
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,970
the exact same thing that were in the
communities around him

220
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:45,970
carved into an ancient wall he says the
image I given absolutely modern walk

221
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:50,560
can stand in as a drying up the engine
one as I did not notice any difference

222
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,210
so unfortunately was so hot at Karnak
that he was able to draw the wall that

223
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,020
he was looking at

224
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:58,600
but he did provide us with these
illustrations

225
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:05,050
now be spine drawings are the reason
that you have a pin tumbler lock on your

226
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:05,580
door

227
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:11,520
when his journals were published in
France

228
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:16,320
it media a huge stir and then when they
were translated into English

229
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,060
four different times over the course
about six years cuz his translator

230
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,630
thought they could do better than the
other

231
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:27,040
I'm in and he published his own version
his travelogue in three volumes

232
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,770
with the plates with all his
descriptions have the

233
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:33,980
Gyptian revival movie there were some
Egyptian architecture the people are

234
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,120
playing with the Egyptian Revival
movement X

235
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,650
loaded in our architecture fashion
everything

236
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:43,610
and these fine little drawings when
brought

237
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,970
England ignited a new debate in the
security community there

238
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,990
as W nicholson put it

239
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:54,300
in the Journal of natural philosophy
chemistry in the arts

240
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,270
the simplicity and other advantages in
this lock are too obvious to require

241
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,070
much remark

242
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:02,460
yes was unlike anything they had seen
before he goes on

243
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:06,130
I should confine my present observations
to its degree of security or in

244
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:06,960
viability

245
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,220
we may admit that the ancient walk with
many pins following independently of

246
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:11,900
each other

247
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,440
cannot be picked or opened without its
key

248
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,900
now if there be a number of these pienso
place then adjusted

249
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:25,540
as to fall into their respective sockets
at that position and the bolt when shot

250
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:29,089
if their lower tales be a bit different
whites

251
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:32,940
and a key be made to correspond with
them

252
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,870
and lift them all to the proper hate at
once the combination will be such as

253
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,130
cannot be made out by any impression

254
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:43,760
or tentative process upon the walk
itself tentative process is the term for

255
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,150
pension manipulation walk we teach you
was back then at least

256
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:51,210
let's have one more look at those
illustrations cell

257
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:55,010
these were fixed-length pegs

258
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:58,520
that we're pushing small pegs

259
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:03,080
up into what we would now think it was
the Bible in the locker really was just

260
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,040
the housing

261
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,480
have a stable the ball would run through
that staple

262
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,950
into the wall the pins would fall down
into the Bolton that he would lift them

263
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,860
out of the way in which portrayed out

264
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,090
This was unlike anything that the
European world have been dealing with

265
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,310
for a very long time

266
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:21,340
awarded locks have been all the rage for
centuries and centuries

267
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,950
this was sea change for them

268
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:29,140
and at the time they thought this was
incredibly secure

269
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:33,920
and as this guide describes I mean me
the changes that this man describes an

270
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,140
1804 become your lock

271
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,620
instead of having the sticks linköping

272
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,330
pins he says if they're lower tells me a
different links in a key made to

273
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,420
correspond with them

274
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,950
and let them all to the proper hate once
the Company shall be such

275
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:53,340
as cannot be made out by impression
personality or tender process of course

276
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,050
we know

277
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:57,180
now became upon the lock itself

278
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,300
on 1805 we see the first

279
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,270
implementation of a pin lock this is
Abraham odor Stansbury

280
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:07,870
I'm this is actually really rate in line
with the

281
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:11,930
Gyptian lock I that's a spinning plate
but as a series of holes cut out a bit

282
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:15,550
there's a leaf spring what you'll see in
the lower left that has a fixed length

283
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,060
pic on it those leaf springs push

284
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:22,910
up into the holes in the desk you'll
have a key with a series of pegs that

285
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,280
match the pattern of the desk

286
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,120
push that and you put all the leaf
springs back and now you can roti

287
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,320
that roller but will throw the bolt so

288
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,120
still fixed-wing really rate in line
with the I Egyptian walk

289
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,080
this slide is from Alfred C harms

290
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,610
I am I

291
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:43,689
fantastic work on lock to lock picking
her up the region's

292
00:16:43,689 --> 00:16:48,040
he also in this is with quite a bit for
sale at this point covers how he would

293
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,670
have attempted to pick the Egyptian walk

294
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:53,319
sorry just as a street pic there any
describes that he would put pressure on

295
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:53,819
the ball

296
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:56,889
while lifting up the pins on the sounds
incredibly familiar I hope

297
00:16:56,889 --> 00:17:00,439
and the bolt is able to come free I

298
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:04,760
butts at the time

299
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,220
this was remarkable and wanna see all
senior

300
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,199
wines at making the closest thing the
you would think a

301
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:16,569
as a modern contemporary lock and I
think maybe forty four 1844

302
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:19,589
this is actually has a rich patton model

303
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:22,980
for that walk I am and then his son

304
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,350
wanna see all junior fifteen or twenty
years later

305
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:30,870
comes up with the modern can come where
lock it rotates

306
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:34,740
the cam operates on the Boltons that
have the key directly so on and so forth

307
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:40,860
and following this was directly directly
inspired by the montanans re finding

308
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:47,090
up this carving in the wall and now you
find pinned under locks all over the

309
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:47,570
world

310
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:50,830
see you can understand why would such
the

311
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:55,470
incredible connection to the pin to
unlock that we would take vyvanse word

312
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,389
for that four thousand years right okay

313
00:17:58,389 --> 00:18:02,740
so what's disrupt that a little bit
denim

314
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:06,919
I'm throughout his travelogue says
things like these rooms are waiting for

315
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,200
me for four thousand years he he refers
the four thousand years

316
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:16,139
a lot napoleon in giving speeches to his
man says things like from these

317
00:18:16,139 --> 00:18:18,919
monuments younger forty centuries look
down upon you

318
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:22,279
this idea the Egyptian ruins just being

319
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:25,440
as a whole four thousand years old

320
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,159
was just the thing to say I do you see
this repeated a lot not just from these

321
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:32,519
two guys but in other literature of the
time

322
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:37,960
now white denim says really specifically
that really tells us for us

323
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,929
when talking this is from the
description of the actual plate

324
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:45,529
I have placed among the antiquities
because it is the same as that which was

325
00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:47,639
used there for four thousand years

326
00:18:47,639 --> 00:18:50,990
but I have found sculpted among the
release adorned on the Great Temple of

327
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,430
Karnak see literally says this locks
four thousand

328
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:58,090
old but Egypt one for a really long time

329
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:02,750
really long time VR

330
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:07,610
on this which is from very early
egyptian civilization around 3100 BC E

331
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:11,660
BR Donbass the figures the systems of
government

332
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:16,280
religion so on and so forth wall there
were great revolutions within that

333
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,010
community

334
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:20,980
if you were to drop in at any point
injection history would recognize it as

335
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,910
ancient Egypt

336
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,990
this from three thousand years later

337
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:28,730
seems Tyler figures same style of art:

338
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:33,960
so when they're saying four thousand
years then comes in three thousand years

339
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:40,420
of history in that incredibly inaccurate
now at Karnak itself just Karnak

340
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:43,730
that developed over the course a blue

341
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:49,130
nearly a thousand years just that one
site and Karnak was enormous

342
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:52,250
conic went on for so long

343
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,910
the position in the water changed and
went away

344
00:19:55,910 --> 00:20:00,180
aerial the build out larger and larger
areas there were 30

345
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:04,280
different heads of state that were
involved in construction

346
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:11,280
at cana so even being able to find out
where he was looking

347
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,450
and what time that would correspond to

348
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:19,080
starts to become different difficult
especially because

349
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,210
ruins continue to be ruined he was
looking at this more than two hundred

350
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:25,590
years ago unfortunately in that time

351
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:29,650
lot more destruction is taken place add
very small example on

352
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:33,250
1899 there is a domino Lake collapse

353
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:38,480
a series of columns have a style Hall
the never

354
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,910
stop getting wrecked now thankfully

355
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,920
he said to us ice on offering of 30 bill
asks

356
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:51,710
adore on a gate and that it was secured
by a walk but I see all around me

357
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:56,240
and he says then we can might think you
know I saw that he rests on that here

358
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,260
saw that here

359
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:00,680
but then he clarifies for us thankfully

360
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,760
that he can interpret this collection
items as meaning

361
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,800
that all of these things had a

362
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,830
ritual significance so we now know the
all these things were involved in that

363
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,340
offer he wasn't a saying in offering a
20 bill asks

364
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,310
and these other two things I was an
offering of 20 ballista temple getting a

365
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:16,800
lock

366
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:21,120
so we know that they go together and
thankfully Elaine so lovin that the

367
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,800
digital cernak project in UCLA when I
sent her that blocked access

368
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,830
I'll figures look at this

369
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:31,270
I cell

370
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:35,930
this is a but most the third offering to
ob lists on interior wall

371
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:40,760
I'm has stepped up its Paulus a map so

372
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,860
to put this into context with the rest
of the facility

373
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,070
that red area is the palace

374
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:51,310
so

375
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:55,180
it's a really small area in the context
of the rest in the sanct I am

376
00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:00,900
but what we've known for sure was that
was built around 1470

377
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:05,750
he and while this isn't a huge haha I
gotcha

378
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:09,260
we do have to correct him to say that
this had been waiting for him for thirty

379
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,220
two hundred years

380
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:14,880
now in game eight hundred years on the
guy right so what can we do that we need

381
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,250
to start exploring some alternative or
Jim theories

382
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:21,730
what I will propose I'm not the first to
propose that

383
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:24,910
is that the Egyptian walk

384
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,460
was actually present in Mesopotamia

385
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,990
for is going to the northeast a little
bit arm

386
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:35,450
and again I'm not the first person to
say that they had complex locks

387
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:39,970
there are a lot of people 1843 bada
actually finds parts of a complex

388
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:41,360
locking course a bad

389
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:47,100
Austen Henry Lee Rd fines a I believe a
brass key for a pin to my walk-in clinic

390
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,470
Daniel teapots who will be very
important to

391
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:55,630
this paper arm wrote a fantastic piece
in 1990 that will be exploring

392
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:58,650
arguing for complex likeness between mia
Andreas

393
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:02,610
fact I i'm and Finland me the a

394
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:05,750
the fantastic recreation have
accomplished in time we walk from

395
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,510
Mesopotamia

396
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:11,100
David and Joan oats found the all this
artifact have a lock

397
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,150
ever which was in Mesopotamia

398
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:18,320
bird bander specular Bing finkel argued
for

399
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,120
court positions related to pin tumbler
locks and Karen radner Co to fight this

400
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,150
and gave it a name

401
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:27,940
so I am NOT here saying that they had
complex locks

402
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:33,110
I am here sayings they have them first
sup

403
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:37,240
David and John Oates I am they needed

404
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:42,280
the devoted their lives to memory I
fantastic old saying this but Amy a

405
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:46,690
they were there digging I believe in the
fifties and continued going back and

406
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:49,559
doing additional research on finds that
were happening throughout the rest of

407
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:50,290
their lives

408
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:53,780
I am i believe the david has passed with
joan is still with us I'm

409
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:57,140
and this is a drawing I love a

410
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,830
how locking plate that would accept 3
pins dropping through it

411
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:04,200
and where they found this in the context
they found an

412
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,620
puts it as the oldest la carta fact that
we have ever seen

413
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:11,660
now a la carte de facto go back four
thousand years lock artifacts to go back

414
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,690
twenty-eight hundred years almost three
thousand years so

415
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:17,990
what we're seeing carbon the walls and
what we will later look into in the

416
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:18,870
Linguistics

417
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:22,290
are really going to dig in to try to
make our point but

418
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:28,059
all this piece found in Mesopotamia and
earlier this month

419
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:33,610
nimrod was leveled by axis and they had
many more walks

420
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:37,110
in and this obviously is important for
all sorts of

421
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:40,900
by yeah this was

422
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:46,539
frustrating so

423
00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:48,500
Daniel Potts I am

424
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:54,159
a fantastic the egyptologists the serial
adjust with an incredibly

425
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,669
along amazing career recently I'm took a
position I believe that new york

426
00:24:58,669 --> 00:25:01,269
university has been out must really for
quite a long time

427
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:06,590
I he published a paper back in nineteen
ninety that was called walking teenage

428
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,490
misfit email

429
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:10,690
and the typesetter accidentally wrote as

430
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:15,110
lucky and key the name of the journal
was just Mesopotamia

431
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:20,279
I this way and was the Italian it was
very difficult to track this down but

432
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:23,200
when I did it was the first real clue
that I have that somebody else out there

433
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,559
were saying I'm pretty sure

434
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,769
that this was going on a lot longer ago
than any of us thought so the way that

435
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:29,330
he

436
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:34,779
has proposed to solve this puzzle is by
looking at a constellation of terms that

437
00:25:34,779 --> 00:25:36,590
he was seeing come up with a name form

438
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:39,590
over and over and over again they're
always appearing together

439
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:44,769
and the current researchers have his
time were saying that these terms refer

440
00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:45,830
two bolts

441
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:49,200
they referred to doors they may be
referred to hinges

442
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,340
handles but that there were no complex
locks at the time

443
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,399
reasons for being written so they could
not possibly be applied the back

444
00:25:56,399 --> 00:25:59,820
soul literally all he did was he said
listen I am going to take this

445
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,909
consolation terms I'm going sume

446
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:06,240
this more complex model the Egyptian
lock and we're gonna leave these in

447
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,389
there and see what happens

448
00:26:07,389 --> 00:26:11,049
so first he has a the

449
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:14,490
screw to Shigeru and secure ru

450
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:18,539
all three of these he argues are
synonyms for the bolt

451
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:21,620
they appear with the other

452
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:25,690
terms that we're going to look at very
frequently and I almost never appear

453
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:26,330
together

454
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:30,730
rethink their descendants then we have
the

455
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:33,950
blue these are are pinching boers

456
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:38,250
and this just meant whole basically but
in this context serpent reamers

457
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:42,149
noms aku this is

458
00:26:42,149 --> 00:26:45,980
again what we would now think it was the
Bible unblock the housing unblock

459
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:49,149
this for them was just the lock main
component

460
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:52,669
musha lou the key

461
00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:55,840
and finally say

462
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:02,320
it to you the pins in a walk doing this

463
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,330
he went back through a couple other
translations that had relied on this

464
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,440
constellation terms

465
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,659
and he just corrected them in this paper
is that if we follow

466
00:27:10,659 --> 00:27:13,940
what I'm doing here it makes more sense
one

467
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:17,140
example in this is this outlines

468
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:24,140
7 for 15 min are line 73 15

469
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:31,860
are a technical request basically

470
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,820
they sent a letter saying hair locks
don't work

471
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,809
every time we do this this happens and
are not functioning for us anymore we

472
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:41,270
need something to fix the locks

473
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:46,309
so the way here that we're gonna look at
110 here which is sort of the crux of

474
00:27:46,309 --> 00:27:46,970
the argument

475
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:50,240
the wavy Chicago Assyrian dictionary

476
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,929
section Eve page 133 reads this

477
00:27:54,929 --> 00:27:59,380
as if the bet above the key above the
temple with his star

478
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:03,370
is lifted and why is on top of the
handle and the lock

479
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:07,320
something goes wrong so if we think
about what

480
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,990
the cat is saying you're saying if the
key is set

481
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:15,580
on top of the handle it doesn't work
well wooden workers that doesn't make

482
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,480
any sense that doesn't operate a walk

483
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:22,919
using arts is who arrangement have these
terms

484
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:26,270
he said this says if the pin

485
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:31,240
up the lock up the temple this star is
lifted nope hav the whole the bolt

486
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,029
it goes on to say that when we lift

487
00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:39,039
up the pens with Turkey they don't read
the send

488
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:44,809
because they're getting misaligned and
lying on top of the ball so by

489
00:28:44,809 --> 00:28:48,510
adopting this new model he was able to
go through not just this but several

490
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,799
blocks in Texas and previously
translated

491
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:55,240
and make them make sense so this is a
strong linguistic argument for the

492
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,140
existence

493
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:00,870
up the pen lock the pins the second to
over the la Clemenza q1 in alignment

494
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,500
with the PM chambers in the Hoople

495
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:09,240
I love the bolt miss you too

496
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,190
so now that we have potential new origin

497
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:14,530
now that we have this linguistic
connection I think the weekend

498
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:18,020
mystery a progression up technology

499
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:22,450
whereas we've never been able to do that
in the Egyptian theory with the Egyptian

500
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:26,530
theory when we look back at this we just
say arm and they have these locks today

501
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:30,080
looks like they have in four thousand
years ago who knows what came before

502
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,960
in the mess but a man sorry we have a
really strong

503
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:40,650
very important precursor elsewhere
Karnak we have this series release

504
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:45,300
in what you can see

505
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:50,910
in the second panel is that he is
pulling up a

506
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:54,660
out of a wall what he's doing is he is

507
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:58,280
opening the sea love the store is
opening the door seal

508
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,840
so Mesopotamia door seals

509
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:07,190
were around for a very long time on the
way that this worked is that you would

510
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:10,900
have ropes coming out of a door to
secure it

511
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,180
you would then run them into this

512
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:17,320
put up a go through it rate into the
wall

513
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:21,160
in a slot for that pay and then seal it
over with more clay

514
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,430
and this was just a seal it had an
intricate design on it and the only way

515
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:27,560
to free those ropes was to break the
seal

516
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,570
once the seal was broken somebody

517
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:34,170
new at least that you'd been in there
whether or not it was able to

518
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:37,890
directly stop you so

519
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:41,450
door seals been around for an incredibly
long time I

520
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:44,990
this is tally macklin a I

521
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:49,100
and the a period becker et was from
about forty

522
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:56,100
460 to 43-40 BCE this turns out to be an
incredibly complex

523
00:30:56,590 --> 00:31:00,680
if small community in this is a layout

524
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,090
have not only rooms that they lived in
but also as

525
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:07,580
also rooms that were dedicated just to
warehousing goods that they were

526
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,330
creating

527
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:13,330
and they protected those warehoused
goods with door seals

528
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:17,360
good written for me

529
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,039
so this is an illustration by the author

530
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:23,679
paper this is referencing demonstrating
how the door sealing and unsealing might

531
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:24,499
have taken place

532
00:31:24,499 --> 00:31:28,210
now importantly he describes that there
would also be a human there

533
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:33,919
walks even door seals the most basic
forms a mechanical security

534
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,940
were always meant as a second layer

535
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:43,940
this is the fence and death here are a
few fragments

536
00:31:46,049 --> 00:31:49,960
the door seals from tell Eva kooning I

537
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,179
you can see some of the patterns on the
ceilings in these

538
00:31:53,179 --> 00:31:58,149
and by taking all these together you can
recreate what the seals would've

539
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:59,169
actually look like

540
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:02,190
now I love this quote

541
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:05,349
door ceilings may be taken as the
earliest

542
00:32:05,349 --> 00:32:09,999
tangible evidence on the evolutionary
transition from a tribal society

543
00:32:09,999 --> 00:32:13,899
to a civilized society Abbas argues

544
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:18,479
practice and ceiling certain buildings
implies a kind of social contract

545
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:22,059
which would be respected by the members
and the community in whose breached

546
00:32:22,059 --> 00:32:27,729
may bring punishment to the offender the
fact that the Dorset things existed

547
00:32:27,729 --> 00:32:28,359
meant

548
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:32,070
that there was some sort of authority
behind them there are some sort

549
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:34,070
organizing structure to their community

550
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:37,889
but their community was perhaps as part
of an organization other

551
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:42,029
larger communities that there was trade
happening the the existence of these

552
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:43,720
mechanical precautions

553
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:48,289
really were the harbingers of a
transition into actual civilization

554
00:32:48,289 --> 00:32:53,669
him

555
00:32:53,669 --> 00:32:58,629
this is a cuneiform for lock master

556
00:32:58,629 --> 00:33:02,460
Karen radner

557
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:08,690
I any amazing paper call that the lock a
master's in gatekeepers binge mass Petey

558
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:09,239
Mia

559
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:14,739
took some the work and Daniel Potts took
some of the workers from the other

560
00:33:14,739 --> 00:33:16,019
researchers I've mentioned

561
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:21,139
and she said we know that we've had
gatekeepers

562
00:33:21,139 --> 00:33:24,149
attested to for palace we know that
we've had guards

563
00:33:24,149 --> 00:33:27,779
we know that we've had people attest to
that literally response to stand doors

564
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:29,559
and be the human barrier Ventre

565
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:32,529
we have a southern term that keeps
appearing in the we're not defining well

566
00:33:32,529 --> 00:33:33,070
enough

567
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:39,889
I propose that it means walk master she
describes this position as a person

568
00:33:39,889 --> 00:33:41,139
would actually be in charge

569
00:33:41,139 --> 00:33:44,970
love the pins up the lock Union Church

570
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:48,519
the pins and the key is they would be
the only one that could apply a lock to

571
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:49,179
adore

572
00:33:49,179 --> 00:33:52,700
and may be the only one that could
unlock it so even if you have a guard

573
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,880
dealing with your human traffic in
saying yes this person can come in

574
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,269
it takes that second factor over

575
00:33:59,269 --> 00:34:03,299
the lock master to come in and actually
open the lock for you

576
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:06,629
so if one person is corrupt if one
person is bribed if one person is

577
00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:07,480
murdered

578
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,310
you still have the back above the lock
which is under the domain of the lock

579
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:14,139
master who would not be in that same
place that same time

580
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:21,060
you have to be called open what's really
important here is

581
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:24,690
sick at a Rob secretary

582
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:28,790
this is the player a lovesick it to you

583
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:34,179
the pins in the lock the name for the
pagan

584
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:41,119
in the door seal was also security as

585
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,200
Karen radner sense the very fact

586
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,690
but the words were the exact same that
we have this league with the connection

587
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:52,679
would imply that there was a
evolutionary connection between them as

588
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:53,149
well

589
00:34:53,149 --> 00:34:59,990
in her paper she says its busy and
Herbert when studying the 565 nearest

590
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,380
the wrinkly ceiling from Innova

591
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:04,839
was unable to identify a single example

592
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:10,069
OVA door sealing so they had all sorts
of seals but she found node or ceilings

593
00:35:10,069 --> 00:35:10,420
their

594
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:15,069
can believes that this would indicate
that the system was no longer in use the

595
00:35:15,069 --> 00:35:15,579
time

596
00:35:15,579 --> 00:35:20,109
the door seals were no longer in use it
never and she believes that was because

597
00:35:20,109 --> 00:35:22,240
it was replaced by the sick to walk

598
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:27,130
so I reached out to her directly as I
was getting really excited about this

599
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,490
point and Karen

600
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:34,130
just Lake Suzanne and Daniel got back to
me immediately enthusiastically

601
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:38,700
and when I said could we say that the
lock was invented

602
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:43,319
by the time we saw these words by the
last time we saw the ceilings

603
00:35:43,319 --> 00:35:46,240
she told me the

604
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,330
title I've Rob secretary was

605
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:52,460
already attested to in all the
Babylonian

606
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:55,650
as all these 1800 PC

607
00:35:55,650 --> 00:36:01,340
and the last clay ceilings that they
have found from large collections have

608
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,700
dubbed or ceilings

609
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:07,030
around 2500 SAR last

610
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:10,280
artifacts door seals that are currently
in the record

611
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:15,480
myron 2500 BCE the title Lovelock a
master

612
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,810
the title unlock master not just
references to the parts block the actual

613
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:19,900
codified title

614
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:24,420
is already showing up in 1800 BC

615
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:30,410
so what we know is that somewhere
between 2500 BC in 1800 BC

616
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:34,630
the lock came into existence and I
believe that came into existence in

617
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,530
Mesopotamia

618
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:41,220
now that's a huge range rate but I think
we're going to close the gap

619
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:45,780
there are more than a quarter-million

620
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:49,119
cuneiform pacts texts that have been
found

621
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,550
more than a quarter-million those
include

622
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:57,350
thirteen million or more words there is
more cuneiform

623
00:36:57,350 --> 00:37:00,380
being studied then the entire corpus %uh

624
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:04,500
Latin there are three million more words
known rate now

625
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,530
the people are looking into that are
trying to understand then we have

626
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:14,550
all of latin history there are a lot of
people working on it so might be a while

627
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,810
before we close the gap

628
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:18,750
but they're doing amazing work and I
wouldn't be able to do any of this

629
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,330
without

630
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:23,720
so I genuinely believe that both from
finding new artifact as states are

631
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,109
continuing to be uncovered

632
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:28,359
and through the linguistic channels as
well that we will

633
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:31,970
ever taking this gap until we have a
really good idea

634
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:38,420
I've when the lock came into existence
and when we know when

635
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:45,020
we can start to think about why

636
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:48,470
and if you'll indulge me I would like to
read to you

637
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:51,890
a passage from a lament for Sumer and

638
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:55,980
her they were destroyed

639
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:00,250
by Warren flood I am and the author of
the lament

640
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:05,450
is describing the scene this is
particularly evocative to me

641
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:09,720
because throughout this research I have
come to quite passionately believe that

642
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,510
walks

643
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:14,099
are inherently human

644
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:18,940
they are tied directly to every attempt
that we have at a society

645
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:22,730
at culture that locks before any other
system

646
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:25,970
love law of policing anything else the
locks

647
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,109
always come before and that locks give
us

648
00:38:29,109 --> 00:38:32,130
room to build society

649
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:36,770
that locks from time immemorial have
borne the burden

650
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:43,770
of social order large axons were
sharpened in front of her

651
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:48,710
the spears the arms a battle were
prepared the large bowls throw sticks

652
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,950
and shields gathered together to strike

653
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:54,609
the bar barrows covering its outer side
like a rain cloud

654
00:38:54,609 --> 00:38:57,910
large stones fell together with great
floods

655
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:01,660
daily the evil women returned to the
city her

656
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:04,890
confident in its own strength stood
ready for the murderers

657
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:09,010
but its people oppressed by the enemy
could not withstand their weapons

658
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:12,640
in the city those who had not been
filled by weapons succumb to hunger

659
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,930
hunger filled the you like water it
would not cease

660
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:19,260
this hunger contorted people's faces
twisted their muscles

661
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:22,299
its people whereas if drowning in a pond

662
00:39:22,299 --> 00:39:25,480
the gas for breath its king

663
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:30,049
brief heavily in his own palace the
glory of the palace

664
00:39:30,049 --> 00:39:33,339
which was once so lovely was
extinguished

665
00:39:33,339 --> 00:39:37,940
like a storm that fills all the lands it
was built there like Twilight

666
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:41,299
in the heavens its doors adorned with
the heavenly stars

667
00:39:41,299 --> 00:39:44,980
it's great bronze latches secured

668
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:49,210
you could not hear

669
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:54,270
the door being watched door went on last

670
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:56,230
there was no one left

671
00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:03,230
the lock thank

672
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:14,800
here

673
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,250
I very much before I take questions have
to acknowledge the help of a number of

674
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,870
people caring rather than a possible in
Seoul been

675
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:24,500
I wouldn't have been able to get started
on this I wouldn't be able to continue

676
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,410
on this if

677
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:29,320
every time I reached out to these people
as just some guy sitting in his bedroom

678
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,390
late at night

679
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:34,410
saying hey I read this paper and I think
it's Lee can you tell me more

680
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:37,510
Daniel Potts got me within an hour

681
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:41,170
can randomly insolvent both got back to
within a day we've incurred

682
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:45,000
new information we've with specifics

683
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,750
other papers they were amazing I

684
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:52,840
Debbie tractor Molly sound turn into
some peer are phenomenal friends of mine

685
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,080
who have helped me

686
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:58,120
work for the last stages this understand
how to present at understand how to

687
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:58,740
structure

688
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:02,540
and understand what it all means arm and
in particular

689
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:05,720
what I really appreciate is that they
not only

690
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:09,960
encouraged but never tried to tone down
my ludicrous

691
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:14,560
enthusiasm an emotional connection to
this material I don't think that

692
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,630
I would have followed this for four
years if I didn't believe so

693
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:18,610
passionately in

694
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:23,880
what locks me John Wilkins all my
colleagues at the Royal Institute

695
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,780
be a champion independent scholarship to
give resources liberate community for

696
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:31,290
independent scholars to do the work that
they love and believe in and I am

697
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:32,660
incredibly grateful to them

698
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:36,200
I my citations will begin

699
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:42,210
I am but does anyone have any questions

700
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:49,210
yes

701
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:59,270
in exxon so the questioners looking back
at that this

702
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:02,890
this password the locks are the
foundation have society

703
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:07,270
how does that in for my feelings about
encryption in the fight for the

704
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:12,580
legal and an easy access to encryption I
think they're a really strong parallels

705
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:17,370
I really do. I all what I believe
happens with walks in particularly

706
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:22,890
regularly I'm we see it in door seals
originally we see it I believe in the

707
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:25,380
transitional oxo bill gets big more into
that someday

708
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:30,390
and we see it in particular I am and in
a more modern lay in the great la

709
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:32,140
controversy pitting 51

710
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:35,150
what locks do for us

711
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:38,690
is they provide us the room to develop
the other systems

712
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:44,190
that creates a civil society in the
social order if you cut of the ability

713
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:45,460
to secure

714
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:49,600
yourself your community or person
whether that's mechanically or whether

715
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,610
that's digitally

716
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:54,200
you prevent the opportunity for the
development

717
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,370
about other incredibly important systems

718
00:42:57,370 --> 00:43:01,970
that society needs to function if we
really want to have

719
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:05,110
a an efficient a

720
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:08,480
collaborative ace see if digital life

721
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,800
I genuinely believe that encryption must
come first

722
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:16,070
because it needs to be there for us to
build all the other structures that when

723
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:17,560
the encryption finally fails

724
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:21,930
like the locks finally fail all the time
all the other systems will now be in

725
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:22,590
place

726
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:29,590
thanks

727
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:37,520
yes

728
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:49,290
mmm

729
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:59,190
mmm

730
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:02,380
I

731
00:44:02,299 --> 00:44:06,400
answer the question is were looking back
at I am particularly

732
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,429
textual evidence of society I am

733
00:44:09,429 --> 00:44:13,309
which do I think will come first the
locker the society so

734
00:44:13,309 --> 00:44:18,059
we don't have much in the way of tax
except for the ceilings and some

735
00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:22,630
wow what we've been able to the sorry I
say we this is one guy in particular is

736
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:24,999
in chicago is amazing news in my
citations

737
00:44:24,999 --> 00:44:29,089
and he's incredible the guy that was
looking at tell you between a I

738
00:44:29,089 --> 00:44:32,579
his main argument that was the tell you
could name it was the transition from

739
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:33,160
like

740
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:38,309
agricultural communities to organized
state oriented societies

741
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:42,319
and while BT based lock might not have
been there at that time

742
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:46,009
he argues why explicitly

743
00:44:46,009 --> 00:44:49,259
that this community was that turning
point

744
00:44:49,259 --> 00:44:52,349
and that it could not have been there
with out

745
00:44:52,349 --> 00:44:56,140
the door seal without that first
mechanical sealing

746
00:44:56,140 --> 00:45:01,619
I so when we look back at these texts we
find references the locks we find

747
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:04,160
references the door seals find
references to the bags are put through

748
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:04,619
it

749
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:08,759
arm and so far they seem to run hand in
hand

750
00:45:08,759 --> 00:45:14,009
tell he become any very well argued

751
00:45:14,009 --> 00:45:18,039
appears to be that first transitory
moment I am

752
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:22,209
to us to potential organization of state
potential organization society

753
00:45:22,209 --> 00:45:25,429
and the door seal was there right at the
moment that happens I think that they

754
00:45:25,429 --> 00:45:25,789
are

755
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:32,789
linked went direct yes

756
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:38,150
it's a very good question the questions
were locks the building in China

757
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:39,440
independently

758
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:44,420
separately arm this is one of the big
things that I wanna do

759
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:48,420
with another chunk of my life at some
point in time I am there are a couple

760
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,380
have wonderful researchers in Taiwan

761
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,540
but I have reached out to I'm hopefully
be able to help me translate those

762
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:54,150
waters

763
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:57,320
what I can say is that we know that a
lot

764
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:01,740
love the technology culture are et
cetera that was developing

765
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:05,510
in the Fertile Crescent was going each
direction right

766
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:09,220
so so we have some continental europeans
we have some Africans we also have

767
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:14,050
I the the Far East I mean this whole
area is called Near East Studies

768
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:17,930
as a whole arm so we do know that
technology would travel in that

769
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:18,520
direction

770
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:24,340
I don't want to I can offer a strong
enough opinion about that right now

771
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:27,510
but I'm very curious to see how much
independent development

772
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:31,040
there was how much was inspired by some
what was going on here at this time

773
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,580
I and I think that's going to be another
rich

774
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:37,890
multi-year part of my research life at
some point I hope

775
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:40,910
help thanks for the question anyone else

776
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:47,910
yes although that's a really good
question what's early since this is

777
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:50,480
owned by passing a lock surreptitiously

778
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,390
I I don't know the answer to that right
now and I think that this is maybe one

779
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:57,380
of the most revelatory moment meeting
more of an academic been a lot better

780
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:57,950
now

781
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:01,740
I

782
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:05,460
I I had to pick a lock for my father
recently and I was having a hard time

783
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:06,940
you like out or even as a car

784
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:10,050
not that much academic I'll get it I am
and I did

785
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:14,360
thankfully like five after anyway I am

786
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:17,480
I don't know the answer to that i I have
these technical accounts

787
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:21,660
a we have a temple the lost the key
leave the key replaced we have

788
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:24,900
I the locks there were no longer
functioning correctly

789
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:29,010
I I don't know the first time the one
was was defeated surreptitiously we have

790
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:31,860
descriptions and destructive attacks on
locks and gates

791
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:35,560
I'm we have many descriptions and
destructive entries matter factor in

792
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:39,090
in the various laments if you wanna read
some of the most

793
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:39,400
on

794
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,260
gut-wrenching I Lake tragic poetry

795
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:47,740
just look up these laments for server
rumor I think hairdo few others

796
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:52,000
they are epic they are are hundreds and
hundreds winds long they're all just as

797
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:52,349
like

798
00:47:52,349 --> 00:47:56,099
you know their faces contorted with
hunger that sort stuff a lot of them

799
00:47:56,099 --> 00:47:57,500
reference like they

800
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:02,230
ripped the hinges of they did this they
did that as a means of gaining entry to

801
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:03,049
these locked

802
00:48:03,049 --> 00:48:06,470
doors but I don't know of any
surreptitious

803
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:09,950
accounts yet I'll keep an eye out yes

804
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:16,940
I do

805
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:20,819
Adam 17 maybe one other similar to why
we have trouble

806
00:48:20,819 --> 00:48:24,930
I finding appropriate steps on entry now
that that it may just not be

807
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:26,240
investigated and reported

808
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:30,380
I'm in particular I doubt there is much
friends tradition at this moment I'm

809
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:34,900
arm but I I also think that it's worth
remembering that these were

810
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:41,900
human mechanical systems these weren't
supposed to be left completely alone

811
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,050
he

812
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:09,050
I think that is a fantastic point a
fantastic point that those

813
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:15,900
in the in the upper classes were
probably keeping their jobs because they

814
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,320
knew how to open these locks

815
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,450
that is yeah I agree with you
wholeheartedly all

816
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:25,380
real quick i'd do I don't have a
reference to rate now but I do know of

817
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,690
an instance where somebody

818
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:31,390
had developed a system where the word
the seal something with their ring and

819
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:33,800
then through their ring into the think
they had sealed

820
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:37,260
break it open and retrieve the ring
thing I wore my ring is in there so they

821
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:39,240
can make a new ceiling at which is
obviously

822
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,710
I'm and his servant started stealing
from him by breaking the seal

823
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:45,720
taking whatever they wanted to out of
the horn

824
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:49,210
and then resealing with the ring and
bring it back in I am

825
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:53,120
so we do know about that that was Roman
and so not nearly as old

826
00:49:53,120 --> 00:50:00,120
I yes awarded walks Armando around like
1500 we start seeing what are called

827
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:03,380
spring water there

828
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:07,140
basically the same thing as were two
locks was a huge change ominous all

829
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:10,570
continues until around 1770 wanna start
being massive

830
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:14,010
a massive waves and security I

831
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:18,110
which works out really nicely for the
moment the Denon comes around as well i

832
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:19,370
mean all these things really

833
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:22,890
fit together really cleanly I

834
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:25,910
for us to finally wound up with this
lock I

835
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:29,750
getting into the DEP supported locks and
some other variations isn't great but

836
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:33,730
other I don't have time for that right
now I am but suffice it to say that the

837
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:34,730
Egyptian walk

838
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:39,130
on space more secure than awarded lock
I'm we just

839
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:43,860
after the decline of the Roman Empire
other than small localized communities

840
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:48,700
we mostly lost the technology interest
in the world real

841
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:55,700
yes

842
00:50:57,250 --> 00:51:00,770
up what kind have what's being used in
the engine Western row

843
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:05,520
I we know that if you look particularly
around the the one of the reasons we

844
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,880
have 10 blocks is because the room
started

845
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,010
down a different path of development
which is actually still a little bit

846
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:13,710
better than the traditional Ward lock
but eventually became the word lockers

847
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:15,140
their keys were this big

848
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:18,460
and we're lucky gonna be in a leopard I
am

849
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:21,780
the as far as Greece I'm not present
roar

850
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:25,370
I'm but it was very much informed by a
lot about this

851
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:28,740
yes anyone else

852
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:31,970
thank you all so much

853
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:35,320
I love going to present 30 Thank You
Think Carolina con

854
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,220
thank you all
