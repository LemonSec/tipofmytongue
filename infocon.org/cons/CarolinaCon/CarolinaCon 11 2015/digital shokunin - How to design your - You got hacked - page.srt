anytime a file to a directory on the
server which apparently people thought

15
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:56,960
this was like Billy hack

16
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,079
and so everyone across the world had
uploaded to Facebook page

17
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,340

when this you know they said they need
to talk stand literally from conception

23
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,200

24
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,610

37
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,519
about the Facebook pages basically

38
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:27,360
summarizes things to be the digital
video graffiti on the Internet

39
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,269
they they have so many parallels between
the two so many so that the really the

40
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:33,799
face pressures are nothing new in the
Spanish human history

41
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:38,530
I'll I mean I have to bisbee

the to go back to storms to go

46
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:58,140
on would happen work going the concept

49
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,170
a so I'll up like graffiti interest

50
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:16,320
see working from originated I'll so
you're

51
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,080
I'm gonna go through normal to face with
throughout history so up

52
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,340
graffiti goes back as far as ancient
Egypt fingers

53
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,140
on on like go through these
archaeological sites in a finder fee the

54
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,080
obvious wasn't meant to be that began
with are here we define a couple

55
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,890
examples were

56
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:36,240
cause the cartoonish are caricature of a
politician

57
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:41,430
and on the other side is basically what
could best be described what you'd find

58
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,800
in the bathroom at all

59
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,930
Walmart or something basically said
so-and-so had sex with someone so his

60
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,120
wife at the spa

61
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,100
so ho I yeah

62
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:56,850
a its pompeii is like dole treasure
trove ancient graffiti

63
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:01,640
up was a lot of penises everywhere Leo
declarations of sexual prowess

64
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,450
things like that I'll so forget I'm
getting it here's nothing's really

65
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,500
changed since then

66
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,010
a also interesting to note is

67
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,390
I'll lot of you know it vandalism where
we actually gets

68
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:18,980
the term vandalism from a Germanic tribe
called the Vandals

69
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,300
not the pomp and actual Germanic tribes
Lee

70
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,460
got the name from the same thing I'll
the

71
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:32,990
their whole thing was they would go into
an soccer Roman town and just tear shit

72
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:33,600
up

73
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,770
and so yeah at not unlike some hackers
that just a phase pages

74
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,310
this interest in it so now luv

75
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,720
in there later on that is involved today
to what we have is the

76
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,710
modern-day graffiti where you have up
people

77
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:53,180
Europe's spray-painting everything

78
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,360
for every reason up you know you ever

79
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,289
for doing Banksy up %um

80
00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:03,800
with my placer you have like

81
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,210
minute or so a person was your bank's
you doing political

82
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,310
up statements you have people just
saying hey I was here

83
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,090
whatever it's usually bragging whatever
I kinda think so

84
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:18,560
I'll

85
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,460
excitement showing up I'm not the wing
it

86
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,840
I guess I chose two studs more a

87
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,689
so the basically about the evolution of
modern day graffiti

88
00:05:31,689 --> 00:05:34,830
as a stands as it started out around the
60's or 70's

89
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:39,689
a jazz musician called up something is
called the bird or something bird man

90
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:42,909
I can remember not the movie and so

91
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,960
yeah overtly

92
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,469
I'll demigods are not being kind to me

93
00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:55,219
up the the start out with people pulling
bird lives all over new york city

94
00:05:55,219 --> 00:05:56,550
eventually evolved in the

95
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,879
people tagging things arm the most

96
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:03,839
the the group remove it really hits
heighten the seventies and that's where

97
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:04,729
I get to this part

98
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:08,250
or there was a train going through the
Brocks

99
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,270
and it will close above ground and so
graffiti artists would

100
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:16,789
basically target the strains reason
being is everyone got to see it like

101
00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:20,349
Porter taluk you just spray painted in
like everyone got to see

102
00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:23,719
I'll and then it became a whole thing
we're

103
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:27,379
you know the more interesting places you
got attacked the harder play

104
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:31,789
harder the place was to tag the more
bragging rights you got the tiger got so

105
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:32,560
hot tag

106
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,819
the spot it was really hard to get to
kinda like almost like a physical plant

107
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:36,779
us to place

108
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:40,419
so store like this thanks a lot of
parallels between that

109
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:44,069
and up modern-day the Facebook page is
doing and what site interfacing it and

110
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:45,029
then bragging about it

111
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:48,800
so the face for pagers

112
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,740
on themselves how they have all or bball

113
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,710
rather

114
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:58,370
as we get into on this started out with
the rarely hacks

115
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:01,520
this is the Department of Justice

116
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,740
their site got hacked back in the tell
you

117
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,910
as I think it's like 96 but my notes
another up

118
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:12,340
and then later on the CIA had to act

119
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,380
I'll was that

120
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,780
a with links to porn site apparently

121
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,150
and all sorts of you know

122
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:26,970
interesting up things that make fun of
the CIA

123
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:29,970
what's that

124
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,960
was always been cornelia

125
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,230
a it started at ASCII art apparently and
and you know

126
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:41,200
ball from there I'm that's a different
talk though

127
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,490
so yeah exactly

128
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:50,530
a

129
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,650
the later nineties everyone remembers
this actually sadly

130
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,690
remember owning the bumper sticker for
thus and I promise

131
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:01,160
people skull having our I guess these
days as the other

132
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,740
Rick with 100 bell bottoms I'll

133
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,990
by your Kevin urological hack site in
just plastered for it everywhere

134
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:14,710
I'll

135
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:18,450
so I've brought this up because others
not really you talk about

136
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,740
there are a lot of famous graffiti
artists and

137
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,039
I'll in Brooklyn New York and you know

138
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:27,699
as well or if you've ever seen Exit
Through the Gift Shop the the Banksy

139
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:28,509
documentary

140
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:31,759
or if you have an issue it's pretty
interesting banks is like i neva

141
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,330
Eastern sorta graffiti in 2004 or
haven't really seen that with the

142
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,500
Facebook page yet

143
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,260
%uh I so

144
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,560
yeah I'll it's almost the of certain or
get into that a

145
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,640
so the what I did get

146
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,149
is in land good as the showdown for
recently

147
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:54,089
they just right like the new laws doing
the salk the they put up a a blog post

148
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:54,670
about

149
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,950
with scanning excited I've got hacked
and

150
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:01,050
and finding out big the handle 0

151
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:05,830
these guys that are acting the sites and
so and on a few calluses notoriety but

152
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:08,640
basically these are the guys that have
packed the most sites

153
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,140
the top or more or less from everything
they've ever inventory

154
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,250
and I O

155
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,870
could cover the last a there are so many
that

156
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:23,180
would just be here all night I just like
to point out the

157
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,910

166
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,200
