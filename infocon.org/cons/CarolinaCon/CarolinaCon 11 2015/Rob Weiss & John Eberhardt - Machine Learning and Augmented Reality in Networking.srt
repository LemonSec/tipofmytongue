1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,850
we kinda at

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:07,299
to say at the last time we did this

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:11,320
we use streaming analytics and machine
learning so my background as a data

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,030
scientist doing machine learning

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:17,390
hygienic our interest x-art algorithms
so we actually built

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,710
I a working prototype micro fronting

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,910
I'm so we actually built a working
prototype but had

8
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,449
issues with it right and it wasn't
sensitive enough to detect stop

9
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:31,519
there are too many false positives arm

10
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,070
kinda classic analytics problems a lot
of the algorithms for proprietary

11
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,540
saw for our them so when it came time to
basically put in production

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,870
I that project actually wanted two big
issues is one of this offer vendors

13
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:47,230
who actually is my former employer who I

14
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:51,100
quit after they screw the project as
they wouldn't give us offer license

15
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,399
we happily hired immediately after that
that

16
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,800
so while any other thing was at the end
the day you still need someone who is

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,109
pretty sophisticated operate this top
right if you do in

18
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:04,390
analytics are statistics you need to
understand math and statistics

19
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,610
if you doing network engineering unit
Action Network Engineering so the

20
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:08,510
question was

21
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,049
you know what can we do to make this
more open

22
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:15,820
and get more people working on the
problem without the necessarily having

23
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,409
have

24
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,290
really the really specific knowledge
I'll you know network engineering

25
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:21,729
mathematics statistics

26
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:26,450
so mom you know the idea with our
approach was

27
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:30,960
can we actually take raw data and do for
raw data what to do we did for the

28
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,759
personal computer

29
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,850
right so once we created this metaphor

30
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,560
out the desktop and pictures and files
you know people who didn't know how to

31
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,049
write code could actually buy and use a
computer

32
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:44,340
and so the question wise could we do the
same thing for data

33
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,200
right who we take in this case network
data which is streaming data

34
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,560
right could we analyze it and
visualizing away

35
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,909
that would make it representative to
someone who may have no technical

36
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:57,229
background at all

37
00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:01,780
right but can look at pat to the idea
was kinda prosthetic

38
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,780
for the brain in in also had to be real
time

39
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,830
so but before we worry about hooking up
to the brain you don't have to flip out

40
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,580
I am

41
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,070
so this of course not what we did

42
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,680
but we put some cool videos on here cuz
we could

43
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,570
so

44
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:26,220
weekend with the idea data winning right
to the ideas you can go

45
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,820
the Loom and I can settle in muppet have
the threats come in and make a very

46
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,270
complex pattern like this Persian carpet
if you watch that when working

47
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:37,570
you're going to have a hard time
figuring out how every threat works

48
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:41,250
right by trying to deconstruct the low
on the other hand the thing that comes

49
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,420
out the other side

50
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,680
is very obvious to you write like this
is a floral pattern

51
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,840
in a Persian carpet so could we take
these very complex data patterns

52
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,360
and put them into a virtual environment
to make them

53
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,300
more obvious to the user so how john
came up with is the looming concept was

54
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,100
I had Wireshark up one day and I'm
watching all stop both the Wireshark

55
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,400
he is what the hell that shit to watch
what's going on network years

56
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,140
had tubes seen how you can figure
anything out I'm like he's gonna watch

57
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,100
really carefully

58
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,440
so he he meeting in Algiers well

59
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,450
kinda looks like it it would be

60
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,760
your building fabric on Hulu with we
came out this whole concept to deal with

61
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,140
me

62
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,360
yeah X and so are the reason we're also
doing this

63
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,340
is that you know we got started working
are trying to detect zero-day attacks

64
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,930
right is your day intrusions

65
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,280
arm you know part of the problem is you
have a sparse

66
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,450
pattern recognition problem right so
mean a sparse pattern recognition is an

67
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,630
area of machine learning in statistics

68
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,799
when trying to draw an inference from
very limited data

69
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:48,900
so the purpose of this slide said to
make a point

70
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,100
about what people do versus what
computers do so I can take a three year

71
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,830
old kid and show them in eagle and tell
them it's a bird

72
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,489
I can show them a swan and tell them
it's a bird and then if I show them a

73
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,110
cardinal

74
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:04,600
the kid knows it's a bird right you know
the most sophisticated pattern

75
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,890
recognition albums out there still
cannot do this right

76
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:11,230
because they require data curation the
required definitions

77
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:15,409
require training SATs captures are
another example

78
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:18,989
I'll Albert a way that we can show that

79
00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:22,320
human beings can understand these images
and computers

80
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,210
still arm the other example are the
yellow lines in the school bus

81
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,760
so there were some researchers who
actually built a series of random

82
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:35,620
image generators they were able to for I
image recognition algorithms say

83
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,830
this again is all about the fact that
the best pattern recognition algorithm

84
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,850
we still have

85
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:45,000
is the human brain right so how do we
find ways to make

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,419
raw data more accessible to the brain
and this is kinda this lied about where

87
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:50,320
we came from

88
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,080
so I'd John Hanna me a book I guess
about

89
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,570
two years ago and some it was Connor
mansur

90
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:03,190
LZR means the matrix against matrix is
like let's build

91
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:07,570
I was like okay try to build a matrix we
all excited we start thinking about all

92
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,850
the other things are gonna go into it

93
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,610
talking about how we wanted to do it how
we will approach it

94
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:17,610
what we needed to do we realize we're
both sake game developers so we

95
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,780
apologize for visualization military
later

96
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:24,550
I'm we decided to do it all in open
source because clothes or socks

97
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,520
and thats the genesis of John in
nineteen up

98
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,599
arm we needed

99
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:36,000
network expertise we need is some the
science expertise and

100
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,470
we wanted to make it so that we could
almost came off I network defense so

101
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,590
you're playing you know

102
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,940
candy crush you have no idea actually
and my network for E I'm so I was kinda

103
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,900
leading to the whole concept beginning
to the big idea

104
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,849
so the idea was to

105
00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:56,020
again focus on what a computer is good
right so

106
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:00,240
high-speed high-precision high recall
not quite as good at sparse pattern

107
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,000
recognition

108
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,650
interface that with the human brain
which is very very good its part pattern

109
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:06,400
recognition

110
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,409
but has a very low baud rate and socks

111
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:13,130
precision and recall right anybody's
refer got a birthday or anniversary

112
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:18,260
knows how bad we are recall arm and in
order to kinda get that last mile

113
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,289
to the human being create immersive
interface

114
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:24,080
so that the way that you interact with
the data

115
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,140
actually feels a lot like it doesn't
feel like you're doing data analytics

116
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,200
for network engineering

117
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,920
as rob said you're playing a game so

118
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,410
arm is kinda we broke it down for

119
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,120
major areas that we need to kinda tackle
arm

120
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,000
one was data we had a sheep much data
from we can find anyone to allow center

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,700
network

122
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:50,940
why we can allow anybody to give his
data from anything

123
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,620
don't know why UN going out to you

124
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,660
academia and saying hey can reset your
network for like a week

125
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,840
like now arm so we came up with

126
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,500
aside some training says that we had we
build up

127
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,650
the red team routine capture flag
platform that we're able

128
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:13,590
capture some data from teams played
against each other that's kinda what we

129
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,990
used as a basis for the

130
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:19,290
the scoring a to the training the
results kinda

131
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,870
synthetic in morning the platform

132
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:27,350
we really want to make this is is as
fast as possible

133
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:31,140
his in network defense for your
detection

134
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,130
it really is one of things that you got
to be turned on the money operating

135
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,030
wireline speed

136
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:38,630
and then heterogeneous networks whiskers
all

137
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:43,370
and so is trying to figure out how to
get as fast as possible skill

138
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:48,229
possible we quickly learned that we were
gonna do user

139
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:51,169
yes there was a Merced that we had come
up with some type of visual language

140
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:51,880
contract

141
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:57,860
so have to be able to describe the data
enough such that I can create objects

142
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,940
from that data

143
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,660
that has many the attached to it and i
cant put in over sure buyer

144
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,729
that actually was a really for an idea

145
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:11,020
to a lot and major game manufacturers
that we talk to

146
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,260
on they didn't understand non
scenario-based gameplay

147
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:19,300
really would want to do with it why
house esiner

148
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,310
has a person when this key were like
they don't they just play

149
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,310
anything at that so

150
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:29,200
you know we also wanted to do a 3d
experience that was a mercy that also

151
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,289
active like real-world physics so that
anyone can play it so it

152
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:36,729
here used to climb in apps cases you
know what that feels like going down

153
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:37,259
sick is

154
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:40,750
throw things up they fall shootings able

155
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,139
that's kinda how we want the model those
four areas

156
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:48,399
course the important thing here is if
you're going to connect this to a brain

157
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,139
needs to be good brain on Abby normal

158
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:55,690
arm so this is the architecture

159
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,279
arm first Jan 1st version that we bill

160
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,759
your half go a year and half ago we
actually put the thing together and made

161
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:05,209
it work

162
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:08,730
arm the majority this fall this is
actually open source

163
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:13,050
I'm lodged at the IC appears probably
really from a teacher in the

164
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,649
big data analytics are streaming
analytics

165
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:19,680
nothing new nothing need unique nothing
novel

166
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,920
what the hell are researching trying to
figure out how the architecture of it

167
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,720
together work

168
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,050
arm most important thing that we built
was

169
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:31,029
the visual language contract so that was
kinda something it

170
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:34,329
just before and I was kinda britt
industry me analytics world

171
00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:38,209
arm and the actual user experience if
you guys remember

172
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:41,569
in the matrix new goes in the weight
room says guns

173
00:09:41,569 --> 00:09:44,940
guns come out what kind where we put

174
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:49,540
the capability for us to describe things
to bring into the game a couple thought

175
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,319
so that the user experience is based in
the Blender Game Engine

176
00:09:52,319 --> 00:09:55,519
open source game engine probably not the
ideal game in Denbigh

177
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,959
its open-source arm the analytic
switcher kinda my

178
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,850
my thing real time weather for one
second arm I'm sure most people in this

179
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,959
room know storm is basically the

180
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,269
infrastructure that water runs on top
right so it's a very very scalable open

181
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:12,860
source environment for our streaming
data and doing

182
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,540
analytics the challenge with storm is
that storm is a stateless computing

183
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,930
environment so it puts the data
someplace and then forget about it

184
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:23,519
so the minute you me to do analytics any
kinda mathematics statistics

185
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,079
classification

186
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:29,439
it doesn't work well Nathan marcy
created storms pretty smart guy

187
00:10:29,439 --> 00:10:34,029
she's a framework inside storm trying
it's a stateful framework inside the

188
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:38,399
stateless environment and then there's a
library call Triton and now

189
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,529
which is basically a set out from arbol

190
00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:44,720
for storm so operations historical balls

191
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,589
to set up bowls that actually enable you
to put analytics

192
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:52,350
in storm try so there's already some
bolts there were you some of the shall

193
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:52,920
stop

194
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,149
but basically any kind of Python and
Java analytic

195
00:10:56,149 --> 00:11:00,560
and since I did the Triton ml framework
is actually really really cool because

196
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,769
there is a limitless supply of open
source Python and Java analytics out

197
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:06,089
there

198
00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:09,690
right so you could actually build this
and deploy

199
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:13,269
dozens if not hundreds of analytics on
your streaming data

200
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:17,339
without really having to write any
athletics which is part of the benefit

201
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:18,470
about the Pew

202
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:22,540
as a data scientist that we don't
actually need to write anymore analytics

203
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,089
arm there is a almost limitless supply
open source analytics out there

204
00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:32,810
we just need to focus on using them
better I'll so

205
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:36,050
again on baccara design principles you
know we want to use all open source

206
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,750
components not burden our

207
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,019
customers are friends or family with
dealing with licensing

208
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:44,510
arm we wanted to make sure that

209
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:48,459
that we were able to to you run the data
through and score

210
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:51,519
invalidated very very quickly arm

211
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,290
one of the things that by our customer
base likes recently is immersive user

212
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,180
experiences

213
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,279
the guy on merced UX immersive UX kinda

214
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:03,440
so that's that's kinda where we some

215
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,350
word also trying to address a recurring
problem so we won't have really cool

216
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:07,870
kids

217
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:11,089
you know in the basement on Friday night
I'm playing our game

218
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:15,579
need to be some kinda interesting factor
behind it and then also

219
00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:18,620
the pluggable architecture you know
we're not we're not the smartest guys in

220
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,519
the world were

221
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,980
you know we're OK but bottom line is a
lot smarter people out there who want to

222
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,339
develop global architecture let them
bring their own things into this

223
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:29,490
so you can bring in your own

224
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:32,010
tools you can design a torn plugging in
the

225
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:35,770
into the visual language contract in
bringing into the game with you if you

226
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:39,029
want to develop a botnet to come in and
help you analyze data you can do that if

227
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:40,930
you want to build your own analytics you
can do that

228
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:46,670
that's kinda how we want it make an
extensible for this is kind of my

229
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,760
favorite slide

230
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,980
arm Larry Bird network defender of the
future

231
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:55,190
coming back to this idea sparse pattern
recognition and what the human brain is

232
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:55,790
good at

233
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:59,630
for his work computers are good at you
know most pro athletes what they're

234
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,420
really good at

235
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,940
is pattern recognition I am a pro
athlete

236
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:08,050
is good because you know when Gretzky
skates to where the park is going to be

237
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:12,029
in two seconds right michael jordan goes
to where the ball is going to be on the

238
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:12,520
court

239
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,820
in five seconds and they're really
really really good at that even if they

240
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,209
don't know how to write code

241
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:20,880
or they don't understand how a network
topology works and so

242
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,160
my favorite part in this fly is all
these these plates right

243
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,720
but happy these diagrams for basketball
players and have them

244
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,370
are diagrams ad network intrusions and
so when you actually look at the

245
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,810
diagrams which you realize

246
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:37,990
they're pretty similar so if I could
actually create a construct

247
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:41,010
that lets people look at data
intuitively

248
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:45,510
right I can use my my network engineers
by certified security professionals

249
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:50,230
basically as leaders and I can hire high
school basketball players to do pattern

250
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,920
recognition

251
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,240
there are a lot more high school
basketball players there are certified

252
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:54,650
security

253
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:57,910
passions so

254
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:01,589
numbers talkin yes lol you know a

255
00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:07,020
we know word on that the fans who we
know we're

256
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:10,350
outnumber be time so we're trying to
look at

257
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,970
you know ways to incentivize people
ought to

258
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:16,700
think about different ways are doing
network defense arm

259
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,110
you know there's all the whole point
aspect people love points

260
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:24,550
on there's monetary aspects and John and
I talked about maybe havin

261
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:28,190
you know soldiers of fortune for network
defense campaign unlike you know a

262
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:31,380
couple hundred grand a year to come in
and do nothing but never Defence Force

263
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:36,670
I played a game and be a fragile yeah
great yes

264
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:41,670
resumes email earlier yes arm eaten so
you know we also want to do

265
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:45,500
for data what do we do is did for it is
standard unless you know make it

266
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,300
understandable

267
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,340
in you guys doin what large data scene
graphs

268
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,430
large data links and news analysis and
see like the big fur balls like

269
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:57,220
alter-ego like model like Marty go

270
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:01,920
arm so you realize their problem is that
you know I get a pic for a vote for me I

271
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,180
really don't interact with her deal with
her what the hell is this thing tell me

272
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:09,060
arm and then you know we realize is not
really

273
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,920
about the technology is more about you
know trying to figure out how to

274
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,820
how to interact with the stuff that's
already there in a way that makes this

275
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:21,060
you know job a couple generations for
start thinking about how the jumper for

276
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,270
of course innovation can often take
strange forms

277
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:29,820
than it actually is a mister portion is
early R&A

278
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:33,170
is kinda what our demo is to so with
that

279
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,580
talk about our demo

280
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:39,990
get yes ok so basically you know is as
Rob mentioned we did a simulation we did

281
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,500
some CTFA dan a botnet

282
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,200
very simple demo arm focus on network
data

283
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,050
what you're actually gonna see so inside
the tried to storm framework

284
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:52,990
we're using an analytical k-means
clustering and we're clustering dies

285
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:57,760
it identifies local populations so if we
took this roommate totally dark and

286
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,830
filled it with children

287
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:02,730
basketball players and regular dolls
right you would base we have three

288
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,110
populations children

289
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:07,850
fast ball players and regular dolls and
if all I knew was high

290
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,130
right and i was just doing averages are
trends I would be able to figure that

291
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:14,800
out so the k-means does identify sorta
local

292
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,230
what about local minima or centroids so
you'd say okay like in a population has

293
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,920
an average height 344

294
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,779
I the population with an average height
up six per day and i've a population

295
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:25,640
with an average height

296
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,209
a fight wit a right which people like
Robert I

297
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:34,959
so the idea is we simply ran k-means
clustering on poor parent so in essence

298
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,390
we have three centroid to come at a
clustering algorithm

299
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:41,800
the first one which would agree nodes
right I am

300
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,029
are basically got

301
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:48,839
devices are note on the network where
the source centroid is a relatively high

302
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,459
point so it's sending and receiving on
hype or

303
00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:55,579
to a low port so it looks like a client
I by the way this is stuff I've learned

304
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:56,829
from rock yes so

305
00:16:56,829 --> 00:17:00,930
judd and when John you know I'm taking
the training wheels off in Johnson

306
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,020
explain to you guys

307
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:05,360
source and destination port so

308
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,550
so the blue the blue nodes right

309
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:12,559
are nodes that are sending and receiving
on a low port to a High Court

310
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,620
so basically looks like a server and
then the yellow note your week or

311
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,319
indeterminate

312
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,939
right so they're using these kinda ports
in the middle there's no real pattern

313
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:23,770
I so basically do not consistently
behaving one way or another

314
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:27,130
and its also gets into when we first
started working together

315
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:31,200
in is a guy whose base is back on
basically statistics in math my first

316
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,880
thing as well

317
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,840
where's your training setting where your
outcomes are obsolete we don't have any

318
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,390
outcomes

319
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,890
but what do you mean you have any

320
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,210
complaint do we can't go on it every
single session on the network to figure

321
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,700
out if it's a legitimate or malicious

322
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,690
right has it all that's a bit of a
challenging problem cosmos it is six are

323
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,840
designed to train to

324
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,890
and Alka so part of our approach was to
identify things and put them into

325
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:51,520
pockets

326
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,620
to the human operator can look and say
oh here's a pattern

327
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:58,490
that looks like a normal pattern
abnormal pattern or suspicious pattern

328
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:02,200
or something it's just different right
into this is why also we don't use the

329
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,410
words good and bad

330
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:07,060
right because good and they don't mean
anything in this context more about what

331
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:07,310
the

332
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:11,030
different so we're gonna run our demo

333
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:15,750
had so arm the demo near the sea

334
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,710
is really basic its blocks in spheres
and

335
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:23,540
arm they have different colors that
represent the

336
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,810
the different centuries right and centre
guess centroids see

337
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:30,330
mass stuff I don't know that you arm so
the idea is an

338
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:35,940
robust so what we're looking at is we're
looking at how things are changing over

339
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,520
time

340
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,000
in real time cereal based on the traffic
that were pumping through the system

341
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,630
in scoring real time this sure do in
today's video its

342
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:48,210
its killin records that you talk to it
hikers unfortunately

343
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,010
every time we're a simulation it changes
on this in a good way

344
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:55,320
arm by icrc some

345
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:00,090
the user a consistent in normal network
will see some white nose which are

346
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:03,790
knows that really we haven't had any
information about you right at all

347
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:07,730
data not updated talk about arm there
are some

348
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,880
Blue Note which represent a client nodes
in the network servers

349
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,810
and there are some reno's arm Wichard

350
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:17,810
client client aka we got backers yep

351
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:20,940
are and what we're looking at is what
happens over time rates were looking for

352
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,270
two different behavior so

353
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:26,070
the that's the interesting aspect of it
how are they saying sending data to and

354
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,620
from

355
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:31,380
whether to patterns were roles or roles
these things changing if so

356
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,660
what we infer from looking at the data
being transmitted

357
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:40,660
and then del

358
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,890
the area dude Emma start

359
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:49,490
corner time so initially

360
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:53,460
I what you'll see here is we're starting
up wonder game engine

361
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,130
starting up the streaming data which is
our sensors

362
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,170
that pumped through the analytics
platform into

363
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:04,970
the contract into the game and then
you'll see you'll see the game

364
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:11,970
visualization come up here and you'll
see that

365
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:15,960
the blocks that are appearing on the
screen are the nodes in the network

366
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,110
any I don't know if you can see it
really well but you have packet today to

367
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,420
transit transiting between the nodes

368
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,590
arm this is really bad lighting for this

369
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:32,590
to shame it is bigger will stop percent
yeah

370
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:44,880
all better well better okay so that
maybe if you can see it Ariel SMS better

371
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,670
Ariel okay so now what you see is you
see the data package coming across the

372
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,080
screen they're going from source

373
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,840
are no destination node arm the
different colors again earlier tony is

374
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,950
the the behaviors that those on the
network

375
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,990
arm the colors in the balls kinda
simulate

376
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:04,630
on what we determine as being either
server traffic light traffic or

377
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,690
undetermined traffic

378
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:08,990
arm overtime or yep

379
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:12,810
so were at forty-five seconds action the
bottom left you can see your

380
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:17,110
is now here we have a note here that's
kinda acting kinda wacky in all this and

381
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,230
you'll see him go ahead and do parts Ken

382
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:23,680
so this one here watchin go ahead sherry
L he's flipping colors between

383
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:29,670
I a green blue point the server back to
client so it's kinda was interesting

384
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:32,520
note on a network that if you look at is
over time you wonder what this thing is

385
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,110
doing it also known as kinda fire on
Starz

386
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:39,040
you indeed all the different directions
and everything else arm

387
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,790
we can have a rudimentary heads up
display were says nothing to see right

388
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:43,740
now the radical

389
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:49,020
as we kinda flying in zoom in eventually
will IP addresses on that note

390
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:52,430
this is a internal network node

391
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:57,010
no that supposed to be a client arm

392
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:00,380
he starts acting kinda wacky here and
Starz

393
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:05,170
you in Pakistan many many many different
shades EC starts getting responses

394
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:11,280
we're pulling out again

395
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,830
yes it is how you see the overall
architecture network and we have math

396
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,860
in this this network has been sensors so
that we can get

397
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:21,270
arm information about external an
internal

398
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:24,270
mom IP addresses and so this is an
internal

399
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:27,390
observer that's outside I'm sorry
external server

400
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:31,500
up sorry bad handwriting so

401
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,550
John and I this morning with her male
who want to note about the video cuz

402
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:37,100
usually we have a voice over but the
voice overs

403
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:41,080
is kinda into the different audience you
have with your personal ever hear birth

404
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:45,360
arm so as this is going you can see that
this note is kinda acting

405
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,600
the normal in as a server

406
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,050
so it's kinda not available back out
again

407
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:55,790
the other thing is we want to do is have
interacted early with this he can fly

408
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,070
through the entire scene

409
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:01,020
and play around to get meditate about
the new nodes heads up display in the

410
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,720
future

411
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,360
we we plan to go ahead and add a lot
more information about that

412
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,300
arm start I pause because now we're
going to do is

413
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,770
the note in the bottom left hand corner
that was flip-flopping its behavior

414
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:16,040
right and then did a port scan now start
sending a lot of traffic

415
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,550
and communicating with an external or a
an undetermined

416
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:24,880
node and the upper right hand corner so
we saw live traffic coming out from a

417
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,220
lil green is going on in glasses yellow
guy we don't know why

418
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:31,870
so it turns out that at that actually is
another internal

419
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:34,910
on IP address that actually should be a
server

420
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:38,550
but it's with a heavy but he keeps
flip-flopping back between client/server

421
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,350
client/server

422
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:44,760
and then at two minutes and 25 seconds
we'll find another node

423
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,230
it's changing behavior but that's
actually our router so

424
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:51,720
you expect a little bit kinda
flip-flopping behavior from your router

425
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:57,110
so we we also envision night is bringing
network data into

426
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:01,140
to the to just kinda britt represents
cream but also any other type love

427
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:05,570
meditate in Richmond data that we can
think of to bring into the analytics the

428
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,700
kinda help us understand better what the

429
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:12,580
overall picture is on and then as the
analyst go through and understand what's

430
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,830
happening early game players go through
and and tell you what's happening

431
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:19,840
you can add those in is analytics back
in the applicable architecture to make

432
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,240
your

433
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,910
your stuff a lot smarter overtime so
it's all about

434
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:26,930
you know how much smarter can I make
this

435
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:31,830
platform over periods of time was
wincing

436
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:35,130
yeah at this point there's not much more

437
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:38,580
sure that's different this is a letter
sent so it's walk since

438
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:42,430
in circles in a kinda talkin you know
that's very simple

439
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:45,990
an elec Center in this right now on were
lookin at

440
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:49,880
generation to you arm hopefully

441
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,650
will get a little better time in funding
for for the development

442
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:57,490
next-generation I were in talks right
now with a couple be many

443
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:01,700
game manufactures about only is a real
user experience

444
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:08,700
question

445
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:12,890
yeah so

446
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:17,620
we did a demo for schmoke on two years
two years ago

447
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:22,030
and we had dinner gone and we were
shooting robots

448
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:25,140
and that was with that would kill the
packets and killed

449
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:28,760
we realize a dead in scale really well I
kinda locked up

450
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,090
on so we do need on the down the concept
still same yes

451
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:35,870
user would be allowed to take certain
actions inside the game environment

452
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:38,880
those actions with then I a

453
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,460
could trigger active countermeasures or
other ties a

454
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:46,559
network defense activity the one of the
things we want to do support other

455
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,420
the desire to construct is Rob said is
the ability to bring tools and analytics

456
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,650
into the environment

457
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:55,809
so for those who you work a streaming
data the storm environment I'm

458
00:25:55,809 --> 00:25:59,790
basically data streams are are rendered
as topples so want things we talked

459
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:02,520
about is actually adding attribution
into the top all

460
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,640
so that once you have that if I have a
active countermeasure in the gainer

461
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,730
I am shoot the packet throws a bomb

462
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:15,420
at the No DG taken note of wine right it
would actually send a signal back to the

463
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,300
ISS offer to take something now

464
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:24,300
question

465
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,180
so that's that's a great question and
that comes down to

466
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:36,040
base lining base lining also comes down
to what do you think

467
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,830
right so you're the analyst you're
looking at that you say hey look there's

468
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:40,600
a lotta

469
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:45,270
you know traffic going from this no to
that node and its high-volume

470
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:50,540
and its kinda flipping behaviors you
could do Deepak analysis at that point

471
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:53,800
we the individual packets actually I'm
an idiot actual

472
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,350
seeger right in analytic that says you
know if this is

473
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:01,530
stipe recall going from this source to
this destination timex answer

474
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:08,530
go ahead not like in nineteen years nor

475
00:27:22,529 --> 00:27:25,510
yes you can do you yeah this this at
another

476
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:32,510
is my fourth wide open man you can do
whatever you like yeah it's got a red

477
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:34,169
flag over

478
00:27:34,169 --> 00:27:41,169
if question the back

479
00:27:46,929 --> 00:27:50,190
yet that's my I had

480
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:54,110
about a week ago I change jobs and so on
my last

481
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:58,520
things that I was working on reply left
was by organizing the networks in the

482
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,260
quadrants

483
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:03,809
i right now we're all kind around where
plunder consider 00 in the middle of the

484
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:04,350
screen

485
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:07,990
spawn wherever they spawn right looking
at the subnet

486
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:11,840
given in your own geographic area spawn
in was kinda next thing I was gonna do

487
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,900
so you can look at

488
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,159
the difference between your subnets an
external resources and

489
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,460
understand traffickers will be better
wanted the final design principles who

490
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,299
in this room has actually read
Neuromancer

491
00:28:22,299 --> 00:28:25,539
right so so one design principles as the
actual

492
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:30,169
eventually get this to look like arm the
the matrix in your room answer right

493
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:34,059
so the idea he would actually build your
topologies into your geography in the

494
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:34,600
game

495
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,059
so you can actually see where things are
and where they're located in Closter

496
00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:45,059
a solo ESO

497
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:50,510
yes so this really actually this this
status or is

498
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:55,140
in stores is be I collected by natural
the five sectors

499
00:28:55,140 --> 00:29:00,240
sup would be in and what it does is a
collection disposing into a centralized

500
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,620
collector that we do

501
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:06,390
the slowly transformation before we
don't own any Alex platform we're eating

502
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,670
with location data

503
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:13,030
we basically parson right are so did the
things that are machine who made

504
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:16,800
for our purposes right now we have a
very small subset information were

505
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,530
interested

506
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:21,680
currently its net for b5 what you can
bring a map information to this you

507
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,309
bring

508
00:29:22,309 --> 00:29:25,309
arm geo-information this you bring

509
00:29:25,309 --> 00:29:29,530
any kind information that you want is
launching Carly the data

510
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:36,530
to the to the knows you're fine yes so
that's that's a great point cell

511
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:50,679
one of the things that that the the game
designers assets was

512
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:54,010
how somebody when this thing and we're
like you don't

513
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:58,050
so mean the idea behind scoring the
points is

514
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:01,360
if if there's a kid you know you do a
consensus-based like

515
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,270
everybody decides that this is a bad
thing and you work points for that

516
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:09,770
on I'm sorry in the program we did we
had a scoring system we're basically we

517
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:10,400
looked at

518
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,400
the number of packets dropped over time
relative to disruption

519
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:19,679
of network operations so it not a super
hard thing to do but you have to account

520
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:20,380
for sale

521
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:24,250
bathrooms are yes if you let a bunch a
bad packets go by you while you're

522
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,240
watching you lost points in a few

523
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,750
you identify the bat pack is going great
the whole networking this morning

524
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,610
exactly if you're new to the whole
network then

525
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:38,610
plan to defeat the purpose

526
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,220
yes we talked about that at its
attribution so

527
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:45,070
are more things that we want we're
talking about doing was actually putting

528
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:45,440
in

529
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,730
you know trust relationships in issuing
people the general

530
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:53,540
population game players would not have
the ability to take the action there to

531
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,580
score points we would

532
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:58,230
learn from them from their experiences
but the guys that actually could take

533
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:58,990
the action

534
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,910
will be its like a private search that
we would understand that we can go and

535
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:04,090
take that action

536
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:07,430
you know the keyway right and the idea
we had from a game in perspective

537
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:10,520
westech kinda use the same ol he
believes is right so

538
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,690
if you really want to do this right you
make the game very very open

539
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:17,610
so you can actually see the other
players as well so if the ball for the

540
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:20,710
players are actually compensated for
keeping the networks aping you have a

541
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,240
malicious person in the game

542
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,310
they could attack the malicious person
taken down and that's actually the most

543
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,640
effective way to deal with it cuz I said
having some

544
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,090
you know some Todd appear as to make
decisions he bases

545
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:35,040
look at ninety percent of the people
know this person is doing something bad

546
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,210
just take them off

547
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:39,240
so the guys it's like you know arms to
shoot was captured

548
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:46,240
I question over here

549
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,950
yes yes so

550
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:53,480
arm to to learn a problem that that that
we talked about were

551
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,140
was arm was the granularity the
visualization need to be

552
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,530
arm soul or folks we talked to said

553
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:04,460
you know be really great if you do I'll
different age layers including

554
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,150
clustering so that you can see

555
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:09,280
rip leveled drill down into in the DEP
serve it

556
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,650
arm and that's kinda what the the
approach overtaken

557
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:16,299
right now this is next we'll be five
deer so it's kinda aggregated at

558
00:32:16,299 --> 00:32:17,429
conversational

559
00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:23,010
arm and this is you know we haven't done
a whole lotta metrics on actually

560
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:26,980
II how how much time elapsed between the

561
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,549
the information entry in the front and
the analytics to the vet in the game

562
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:35,990
are some experimentation we need to do
we do know how skills also we can

563
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:39,240
we can figure out as killers oliver and
talking with the scaling

564
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,610
in the resolution challenges right to
the summit kinda cool about storm

565
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:46,440
to warnings we've talked about this the
scaling challenges release in storms

566
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,500
killed horizontally

567
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:51,690
it's basically an optimization problem
right howdy optimize your storm

568
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:52,809
environment have enough

569
00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:57,179
noting closer israeli go to scale up and
down traffic but the other thing is the

570
00:32:57,179 --> 00:32:58,230
resolution problem

571
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:01,740
what we talked about was actually having
multiple storm two parties

572
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,780
running in parallel at different levels
of aggregation

573
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:09,510
right so in in in reality you couldn't
really zoom in and out on this day to

574
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:12,179
effectively cuz then on a computer are
you require be

575
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:15,570
huge right but if we actually had like a
lower as

576
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:18,640
topology running and a medium rare as in
hi-res

577
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,990
when you're actually doing it not really
zooming you're actually swapping

578
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:25,220
to visualizing it different resolution
strain

579
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:28,490
I'm and that's basic just an engineering
in a resource problem

580
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:35,490
I'm our trivializes a trivial his
question the back

581
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:53,070
yet so they get into the behavior
analysis the endpoints and the people

582
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:53,820
using them

583
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:58,240
and that is in the thing that we're
looking at as far as collecting data to

584
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,880
at into the meditator irishman process
eventually

585
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:05,010
and so one of the things we have in our
roadmap is dead and things like a map

586
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:05,580
data

587
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:10,400
and and other sorts of information so
Jimmy block just

588
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,190
looking in a block in say you letting
the analytic say whether or not

589
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:17,530
client/server does Nicole a sense when
you know that information had a time

590
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:24,530
sold that this kind where the date
originally comes into play sir

591
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:36,600
yes so that also comes in the you no
knowledge that you have had a time about

592
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,139
your network that you have to

593
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:41,620
you have to put into the analytics
platform to understand that

594
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:48,620
yeah because if you can model their

595
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:52,600
entry never had a time like say my
aunties go on

596
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,880
you know the resize midnight to 4am

597
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,620
every you know Tuesday Wednesday
Thursday whatever you can model their

598
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,620
pattern and then

599
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:04,760
anything outside that window that
outscored by that is as matching

600
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:09,120
will be identified as much as an actual
from the analytic perspective the

601
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:09,930
training walk

602
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:14,240
you can actually set that analytics the
train of unknown normal Sat

603
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,290
and then turn the training of and then
run real data through

604
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:22,380
and it will tell you when stuff comes
out power again this is all

605
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:27,310
John ron's prefer concept right good

606
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:30,830
simply add engineers so hood

607
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:36,140
the site very limited Realty any other
questions russians

608
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:40,330
how do you play with it okay

609
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:45,970
so unfortunately blender does not allow
us to have a web-based interface

610
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:50,240
so you can go out to my guitar temple
all down

611
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,760
and play with it arm or you can email us

612
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,170
review email us side and take a look at

613
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:00,980
the different you're free and open
source people that that kinda

614
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:06,040
have provided us all the building blocks
realistically

615
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:10,560
arm the majority the work that John and
I did

616
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,760
were was assembling the platform price
the software stack

617
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,910
able many really simple analytics in the
middle

618
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:20,640
and then building the Hawks in the
binder reason why we chose blunder was

619
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,070
because it was Python

620
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:25,250
and you know I'm a badass Python
developer

621
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:28,650
and so I was able really quickly
building my hardest

622
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:35,650
stream data into a game engine which
most people don't really do and

623
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:37,280
questions

624
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,540
alright a nice very much appreciated

625
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,850
maybe Carolina time
