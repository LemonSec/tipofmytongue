00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:06,620
one government

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,889
and thanks for joining us thanks for
joining us a

3
00:00:09,889 --> 00:00:14,740
this morning Sunday morning it's a
lovely morning so I'm coming from Boston

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,359
I and this is something that BP's

5
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,350
last month February thats pretension

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,210
if you know a potential building but yet
its

7
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:30,340
so I really appreciate I love you you
know coming in the morning

8
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,350
and O well coming so I was traveling
from FOD link to

9
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,610
but I learned but there is awesome and

10
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,680
9 skippers awesome so group

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,090
so let's begin

12
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,329
here and something about me

13
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:51,789
we might master's degree in Information
Assurance

14
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:56,280
intestine investing blog brick Rockies
YouTube is my handle

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,100
and dude this is my mitnick moment

16
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,460
so last year I was in black hat earned a
I might

17
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,610
mitnick yeah that was

18
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,850
my high sober up before we begin

19
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:14,170
the presentation I want to good this
disclaimer done

20
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,610
wherever I present this I right to be

21
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,890
on the safer side so all the tools and
techniques that I'm going to show

22
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,509
are you know baby are dangerous and

23
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:29,729
if they're not been does live yet
calling us hackers

24
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:34,280
but yes and the pings are only for
educational purpose

25
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,229
I will not pick any responsibility if
you tried those things

26
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:41,810
on your employer Aria friends roommates

27
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,640
ex-girlfriends not I have not been too
big

28
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,899
any responsibility right on your own
risk

29
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:52,920
and no its against law if you are trying
to be in excess

30
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,659
unauthorized access who asserts
application

31
00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:00,479
so so yes

32
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,440
now the disclaimer is said let's begin
what are we going to see in this

33
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,080
presentation so something like

34
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,630
yabe need a practice ground for hacking

35
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:15,100
so why do we need it and then once we
understand

36
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,690
why we needed will try to build a
practice grown from ground up

37
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,250
it's basically allowed that mean be

38
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,200
and then we'll see how we can learn
hacking

39
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,030
so I i'm not going to focus on on

40
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:35,070
one specific technology me be applicants
you're gonna call security

41
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:41,950
I'm considering hiking is a general
phenomena moving ahead we will see

42
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,370
what are those matter so if you see
practice 2012

43
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,930
you want you're done with practice you
tribal play some matches

44
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,310
so and see what kind of matches began
play

45
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,319
and a if we can get some

46
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:58,760
really watch so real orgy or something
and

47
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,140
finally will conclude decision orderly
blank

48
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,910
so yes why do we need it

49
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:11,180
so before we begin by doing muted I just
want to

50
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,850
good opening in Lake how many of you are
developers are

51
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:18,230
student on new software engineers

52
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:22,940
security engineers in you this

53
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,019
this talk is basically a words

54
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:29,230
doctor developers new

55
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:32,340
or security engineers 12 break into
security

56
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,829
if you are prone to go to you on Lake 30
years exp didn't indicate you might

57
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:41,079
find this ok a bit boring

58
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:44,290
me like a I all these things why these
guys

59
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,239
issuing the same old stuff but up

60
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,430
I I have I have a

61
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,360
a a lot of feedback from ringe from my

62
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,439
who be worn know what are those
resources

63
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,079
for hacking interesting specific and

64
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:04,310
that's what be demise of this
presentation II

65
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:08,430
created this presentation for the
students want to learn hacking

66
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,260
12 you know on not even students if
someone is

67
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,650
trying to break into security what kind
of things he can do on his

68
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,750
on to break into securities so that's

69
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,389
that's the whole problem I saw this
presentation so why do we need it

70
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:25,389
before we begin why do we need hackers

71
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:28,930
act is grown I don't start with
penetration testing

72
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,820
so op from my personal part is I don't
like the word

73
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:37,310
hiking I what predicts a buzz word and I
had used it in my

74
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:42,009
presentations idling I am more into
penetration testing

75
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:46,139
interesting I love it so what in the
name bye bye bye do we need

76
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:49,250
interesting in the first place I'm

77
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,300
morning mist I like this our definition
of a

78
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,590
interesting that this either its its its

79
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:00,110
it's a picnic its mattered were

80
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:03,330
assessors beep investors make war

81
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,810
ideal akeredolu so that accompany

82
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,870
a at an application

83
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,990
are over can be secured before it is

84
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:16,169
been hacked so that's how

85
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:21,659
up investing is being cream the mean
difference

86
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:24,820
between up penetration mister and

87
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,419
an attack what should I call malicious

88
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:32,060
I got on attack ads and his missions so
attacker is

89
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,889
the differences on missions when I am a
print edition

90
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:40,550
penetration tester I get but mission
behind but as butta

91
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,830
attacker it didn't happen missions so
that's

92
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:48,150
illegal in so I am more into a legal guy
this way

93
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:51,220
you know when neutered responsible
disclosure

94
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,370
I I am completely irresponsible
disclosure and I think

95
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:58,889
be as a security community has larger

96
00:05:58,889 --> 00:05:59,680
say

97
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,389
no making the technology problems so why

98
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:08,740
we have been used to this level because
there are people work trying to

99
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:13,440
had things and making things better and
I remember a famous quote like

100
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,550
who what are those a famous hackers by

101
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,710
by pads are never it will do cat those
famous heck hackers

102
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,060
because up although which our guys are

103
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,350
white hackers iron how true is this but
yes

104
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,940
so why apprentice to writer

105
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,180
notebook definition like why do we need
it

106
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:38,320
before attackers fine oil tonight system
we want to find those

107
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,199
Ando sometimes it's a requirement from

108
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:45,860
compliance standards as well so if you
talk about PCI DSS

109
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,860
I love PCI DSS and a so

110
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,210
when your dog over complaints under
today that to push for

111
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,560
penetration testing and acting so and
the

112
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,130
lastly V is I'm not enough just running
and it's a scan

113
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:05,949
and a you will probe into will never get
in front of an employer that the other

114
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:06,740
one limit is

115
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,909
Lord when the sorry if

116
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:14,659
if you show him and exploit if you can
just show im

117
00:07:14,659 --> 00:07:19,520
if you opposition on is the stock you
more interested and biting that when

118
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,130
they beat him

119
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:23,960
remove wouldn't mister in putting effort
and they're giving you

120
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,960
that money so we is on our team so we
need

121
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,289
interesting we need a real hacking now
we get to the DL

122
00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:36,110
how to get started so we have the law we
saw other

123
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,610
you need penetration testing its good
blah blah blah everything but

124
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:44,120
one can get started you know I'm a
student I

125
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,220
I don't have any experience in industry
how to do it

126
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,710
and a and you say they're hiding is
illegal

127
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,770
I I'm interested in hiking what

128
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:57,800
how should I start so bets

129
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,080
where are backed his crown will come
into picture so in order to develop the

130
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,880
skills

131
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,270
you need who have some practice go and

132
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,389
or up going to backtrack is gone I

133
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:12,820
well read this line it is illegal I
repeat its beleaguered

134
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,410
attack near taken by so so visa

135
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:20,550
you know make sure that you are not the
letting those things better

136
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:27,550
with as you do not have permission
explicitly so

137
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:31,639
now be understood why we need a pact is
gone Europe alone thanks

138
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:34,789
this is a penis court Ando

139
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:38,110
it is know your enemy No yourself and

140
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,300
have woodpeckers so when we try to

141
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,810
been our own practice grown we should
know

142
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:49,850
who are you attacking we should know
Howard be attacking

143
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,950
technique so we need basically attacker

144
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,000
and a victim and then

145
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,330
began very this gets so

146
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:05,839
let's create a practice go so I remove
I'm going too fast but

147
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,690
if you have any question 30 and in
between

148
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,700
I want to make this position interesting

149
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,980
and indirect so if if if I want to learn

150
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,130
penetration testing is above foster from

151
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:23,209
sounds I think yeah it is

152
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:27,150
water from sounds and no this for the
application but it is interesting you

153
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:27,600
need

154
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,060
these kind of resources you have Wenger
I was going to

155
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:34,430
servers and then some Madden systems

156
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,660
some client machines internet everything

157
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,279
it it's expensive

158
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,930
I in a student's life I'm not be able to
afford these many resources

159
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:51,020
lippman a hacking its will have been
missing too much

160
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,430
and a again the risk is II

161
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:58,300
iron or so let's try something
inexpensive

162
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,430
you know believe me I miss to bring the
head I define or

163
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:05,850
Jeep and freebies soho let's

164
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:09,100
make a recipe for practice grown
daughter a

165
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,130
penetration testing lap so as we saw

166
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:16,529
we need went up things servers routers

167
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:19,650
your applications an action everything

168
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:22,010
so we need some infrastructure

169
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:25,750
in essence what what what that in
perspective what do we need

170
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:31,100
so Jeep Grand Prix virtualization
environment you can go with

171
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,830
VMware VirtualBox anything we get you
know

172
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:39,050
from not use 10 they give us a a free
license licenses

173
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:42,890
licensed be in that location to art one
good thing I could be used

174
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:46,890
License version this is the environment

175
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:51,750
and then be need ACA so there are two
specific

176
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,490
operating systems but lohr all the

177
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,680
whose but I require

178
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,050
not require incident but that make like
easier

179
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:05,440
so boosting the things we need

180
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,610
and that is Pacific specific thanks

181
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,730
so we need attackers retarded

182
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:17,200
so not a lab a if we have actor we
cannot attack anything in buying

183
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,840
but if you can get with the machine

184
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,340
and be good I am different techniques on

185
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:28,740
with the machine and learn you I can
techniques are

186
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,150
UN if a new series published we can just

187
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,160
be there well it into our

188
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,770
target and I had so

189
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:41,980
are these things enough no

190
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:46,680
we need some green without brains

191
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,050
everything is wordless who need brings

192
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:53,330
that is resources that didn't make like

193
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:56,760
easier like the end of the day you have
to do it too

194
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,320
so this is my philosophy and I have been
ordered some other

195
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,680
you know real hackers hackers are not
those people who dis used to it so

196
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,030
if you talk to somebody didn't just
interview Askim up soap to watch the

197
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,270
coolest thing that you do

198
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:13,080
hippie pieces there I used for security
look what impact as a

199
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:17,640
super cool to and I just plug and play
and the moment I

200
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,890
click something it had to be by fire and
I get to do

201
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:24,950
I'm sorry you said use cool impacting
this

202
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:29,210
press when we're going to get the group
is this you call the coolest thing

203
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:33,250
so i'd i'm not respecting you have to
have

204
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,840
a super quick

205
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,560
me that you have design something you're
you should not be

206
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,860
reliable you should not be dependent on
whose

207
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,700
that's not packing that's not contesting
about so

208
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,550
let's begin over to what are those
attackers that we can use

209
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:53,770
so toward the presentation I'm going to

210
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:57,050
share numerous resources

211
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:00,220
and if you are not aware I

212
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,820
will become a new I does donato article
you can

213
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,790
take the condition later but these are
resources that you can

214
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,830
used that freely available beer

215
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:14,210
your own lab so let's begin with the
famous attacker

216
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,830
operating system anyone heard of

217
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:21,170
prolly archerd ask anyone not ok

218
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:24,660
should I use and is my go to

219
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,880
operating system I coming from

220
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,090
security Ando I think

221
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:36,260
so now the the they are calling it as
Cali under it was back to

222
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:39,680
sorry backpack 12 34 are two

223
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,040
I 3 by via tonight lot going on now be a

224
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,340
because and it has everything so its
it's basically an operating system

225
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,940
with all the dudes reinstalled you need

226
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,640
anything specific everything is the
ability to this

227
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,810
though yes scottie

228
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:01,030
there are a bunch of other operating
systems

229
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:04,050
that you can use so I'll go through each
of them

230
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:08,270
summer right so if you are more into
bill application for interesting

231
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:12,150
web application security like breaking
with applications

232
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,640
sandra is your will govern has

233
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,730
all the dudes weird around website so

234
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,790
things like bar things like

235
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:25,860
will enable applications burden to
seminary

236
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:31,310
the the inside now you are not been
developing and security of network

237
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,340
security policy

238
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,970
you are into forensic

239
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,620
environment you want to do more into
forensics

240
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,850
you need whose were specific to put in
six-member different 6

241
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,100
you on than you might not find good

242
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,170
whose in in a in Cali are senator what
you will

243
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:51,450
fine good number of students into

244
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:55,050
so if you are someone who is interested
in politics

245
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:58,870
and the way your distribution

246
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:02,160
then back boxes and other friend to I
like this

247
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,920
distribution I'm your trip type: into
bike toe

248
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,269
big claim but they are the

249
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:12,890
most secure are hacking operating system

250
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:18,930
so it's always a agreed of you know if
you're using a cartoon X

251
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:22,880
they did generally wouldn't do and
nobody

252
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,279
hardens their college in X that's that's
pretty interesting

253
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,470
and it's like awning the

254
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,720
the printed if you want to cry dis desi

255
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,390
most of the guys who were up with
Smith's

256
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:41,680
BK they do not change it there root
password its

257
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,130
who've been to Kylie and you can get
your their machine and

258
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:49,730
good information so so brindell claims
to be most hard-earned

259
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:53,780
next II most hardened attacking Linux

260
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,520
your to CV with their claim is right on

261
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,780
been there us and now we are

262
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:04,340
and bring to a boil look willful and you
know everything is on

263
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,470
and regulations are iPhone so

264
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:10,830
that's where we need and repayment it
has

265
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:15,010
a bunch of dudes specific to end right
so

266
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:18,400
that's good no I look fine do things in
Cali on Saturday

267
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,440
if I have an assignment for

268
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,620
and Radha very interesting I definitely
use

269
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,400
save so most of the students they come
to me and they say that we want to try

270
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,480
up mobile app security what why how to
restart

271
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,310
so the basic things again you have to go
alone

272
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:40,580
basic techniques I what is Android how
it works how absolute howdy

273
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,620
interact with the network we're going to
be nice

274
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,200
going from the iPad to server at this
you going to do to working to better

275
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,980
their sporting

276
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,430
on the device but if you want to do

277
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:54,500
more I if you want or can we

278
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,150
things the meet some to hit

279
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:02,960
that that's where these kind of things
so

280
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,560
not have seen we have attackers no been
are you going to attack

281
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:11,520
as we saw that legal got back anything
in the white

282
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,390
so are there anything deliberately

283
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:19,510
letter yes they're up about it again are

284
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:23,610
numerous you know we have my favorite
but I spoke W

285
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,720
yes up to had got to be agreed

286
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,350
it started but exploitable up all the
lead with

287
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,230
services

288
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:35,330
applications were you know be together
and then poured into mister

289
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:39,340
operating system you just need to poop
is operating system and

290
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,960
and you one protest someone Liberty

291
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,179
interested so I like it we're good
bordered on network

292
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:51,540
have his how Packers has gone high-tech

293
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:56,059
so respectively good written a very
specific applications

294
00:17:56,059 --> 00:17:59,660
who as a you know in last night out of
nowhere and repayment

295
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,980
so if I want to build my skill

296
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,290
into I iris application there is

297
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:09,770
something called Bambola rebel I was
application

298
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:13,530
its it's available I was application it
has all the while nobody's

299
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,820
removed you can installed art

300
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,140
application and start I can that
application

301
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,400
so eww Abia

302
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:29,120
is something in web services good

303
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,210
my period because it includes former

304
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,590
so I'm still just wouldn't I one I like

305
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:39,590
those up well able

306
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,710
things that Peters me if the peach me
something

307
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:46,950
if it's in a tutorial on Mac so in the
in the in the later part of my

308
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:47,660
presentation

309
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,120
I'm going to show you a demo of good as
well because

310
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,120
it it's pretty who to know that

311
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,660
so good is there then well hope and just
to let

312
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,059
all the readers are bird you know II
don't order to

313
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:04,830
an image from investor lap or hardly

314
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:09,790
but I wanted to see what kind of things
we can expect from Martin Android

315
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:13,010
hackney's 0 you think you can install in
Europe

316
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:16,460
mobutu machine but there is I got me
where everything

317
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,900
is on the clout so coming from UN
Security &

318
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,190
you can build your own environment

319
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,910
Ando start hiking so you don't need

320
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:30,220
over to Asian cream work force it have
had gotten

321
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,520
yeah

322
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,270
usually brings do with I've never

323
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:40,470
going to be everything have to learn the
techniques so

324
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:44,100
had so now we have seen what kinda
infrastructure we need

325
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,370
bury our hiking lap but

326
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:51,049
it's not sufficient you you have to
learn it by doing it so

327
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:54,720
in this I'm there are a few tools
available

328
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,919
all over the internet backed something
that I learn about our community

329
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:03,870
know whenever someone loans new picnic
or discover something new

330
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,929
he you make so we do he makes a good
blog post

331
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:10,710
to the number of people available you
did the right

332
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,169
consistently or blogs initiated
techniques

333
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:18,330
so you have to read those blocks to
learn Ando

334
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:21,900
prior things in your lap so

335
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,010
I have couple looked it was two blocks

336
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:29,840
simple the movies you know just sure you
how we can

337
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,850
as these things so this is my lab in 10
min

338
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:37,660
and I'm this starting machines

339
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:44,660
so this is my

340
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:51,850
exploitable to it is

341
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:58,570
so I I just ran a basic and map so for

342
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:02,110
just see what kind of services are open
on this and

343
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:05,110
just show how easy it is

344
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:08,630
to enumerate services

345
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:12,120
and everything on this machine so this
is

346
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:19,120
the newest only 1.1 and

347
00:21:29,229 --> 00:21:35,359
so I just ran week and map to

348
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:41,769
this tournament at work in offices are
open on Mondays

349
00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:48,769
later

350
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,950
it went in in the meantime I can show
you I did was fucked

351
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:01,350
you can see there are plenty of things
open

352
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:04,529
an easy to learn FPP your juicy things

353
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:07,870
II grab those in and by not paying

354
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:11,399
exploit specific to these things and

355
00:22:11,399 --> 00:22:14,539
on these things you can now

356
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:18,919
you don't have to going to go to mission
every time for these things

357
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:23,120
because you know if you want to do
something on the replication

358
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,490
than you can't simply go to your
browser.

359
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:34,490
open and

360
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:47,519
and here you see you were get minutes
played a bit weird bizarre

361
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:50,529
when mobile application that I was
talking about commodities

362
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:53,750
word application everything is here on
the top 10

363
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,750
when the movies are here you can as
everything learning

364
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:00,309
interminable so let me show you

365
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:03,570
more across its gripping

366
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:07,260
if you know cross-site scripting
Crawford gripping is attackers able to

367
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:07,860
inject

368
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,320
militias JavaScript and extractor

369
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:18,320
cookies yeah everything

370
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,120
said

371
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,809
standards you know you're there you want
to add something in your blog I'm just

372
00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:28,880
using a normal

373
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:35,880
be in or that a group in reforming

374
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:46,540
to be in our district its approval on
too pure never die

375
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:50,330
right to show or because it's gripping

376
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:54,070
this and here you see to a little bit
because it's gripping your business

377
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:57,270
and his persistent imager its saved in

378
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:01,960
into the database you can try all the
other minorities cross-site request

379
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,670
forgery

380
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:06,010
I does injections injection going to
everything

381
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:10,370
on from your host machine itself you
don't have to go into the

382
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:16,370
p.m. is moving ahead was

383
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:23,370
with them so accordingly so

384
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:28,970
I'll keep good amount would be an just
to make sure that I'm not

385
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:32,870
only but I want to go over have nothing
has been

386
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:36,179
so let's ago her and a I'll keep

387
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:41,530
good for the in my puter so now give
seniors set up on lab

388
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:45,630
everything you know how to hack
everything and what

389
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:50,360
is it enough going on the giant now
going on the buzz words hacking

390
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,480
sequined action cross-site scripting is
it enough

391
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,540
no it's not enough that they did not
make you anything the lot make you

392
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:57,980
explode

393
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:01,200
already overdue is when you practice

394
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,480
everything in your own lab you have
proprio

395
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,400
you know in the real world very very
very contrite

396
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,050
things sought buying

397
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:17,110
them bunch of competitions going around
the world for this

398
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:20,410
so I i've just mentioned one hears the
CBC thats

399
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:24,540
more opposed to rinse participating
students participating in

400
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:28,980
defense competition because I like a
different from traditional art

401
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:32,660
really focused more on agen competitions
in always

402
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:36,870
a preference is given for that but the
two will initiate over your BlackBerry

403
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:37,830
strings are trying to

404
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:41,580
defended application by keeping it up
you don't have to you know

405
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:45,489
103 down for any reason the city's is
one good thing

406
00:25:45,489 --> 00:25:49,960
I as I issues as well backs that's cool
because thats attacking

407
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:54,669
but BB these are for students know what
I would do this from the audience

408
00:25:54,669 --> 00:25:59,059
yes CDF after the flag these are the

409
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:02,399
places with that I call magis

410
00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:06,799
because they generally a foundation is
generally uninterested in which is

411
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,859
white similar going to prison for
infrastructure

412
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:14,059
saying in the present heavy means there
isn't everything

413
00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:17,759
so here in two days as well we have
different challenges specific

414
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:21,190
technologies and I heard there was a
purpose and

415
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:24,460
in the CDU so that's how you can learn

416
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:30,009
things bees environment burial in my so

417
00:26:30,009 --> 00:26:35,649
what are those things so the first point
is

418
00:26:35,649 --> 00:26:39,119
every on in

419
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:44,340
tickled any conference you find TPP the
best example is this

420
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,359
yesterday I i saw this really cute nose

421
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:50,409
so excited included in my a presentation

422
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:53,859
because going up on you warburton know
better

423
00:26:53,859 --> 00:26:56,899
reasserting built got a little think
media so

424
00:26:56,899 --> 00:27:00,970
NEC gift is gooder try to play title in
some point

425
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:05,049
and communicate with other participants
you get to know some good techniques

426
00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:08,840
if not be conference there are

427
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,279
went to CBS available please babies some

428
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:15,720
on end up on my of learning things you
know progressively

429
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,249
so order via the the picture that you're
I'll

430
00:27:19,249 --> 00:27:22,840
looking in the top is from or the wire
and

431
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,359
they have more than 15 games

432
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:29,590
and dedicated to different technologies
so

433
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:33,479
if you are into system hardening if you
want to see how Linux

434
00:27:33,479 --> 00:27:36,809
oh and security work together you should
try some of the challenges

435
00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:40,019
so I think more pics is for estate
related things

436
00:27:40,019 --> 00:27:43,919
if you are into bill application
security net s in in the same

437
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,599
Wonderland its deep it's completely on
replication

438
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,859
so again designed in C Diff

439
00:27:50,859 --> 00:27:54,559
for Mike to level 12 people everything

440
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,640
backed that's kind of where there are
other I'll

441
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,070
places where you can go smash this back
we shall everything

442
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:04,350
so these are good at the same time

443
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:07,809
a C Diff are good you know you face
challenges

444
00:28:07,809 --> 00:28:11,820
but what other people are doing you
don't win everything

445
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,919
but at the same time you have on main
challenges

446
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:18,270
big big companies they are hosting
online challenges

447
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:21,570
so so just a quick question

448
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:25,840
do you know this this anyone has seen
this

449
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,730
X is gay media ok overall

450
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:33,929
to business something that Google who
stirred on

451
00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:37,049
that ap sports booming in the month of
for

452
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:40,919
May or June mid-june 2014 last year

453
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:45,140
the design dope a cool its importance in
simple small

454
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:49,730
cross-site scripting game before on the
hackers just ripped right

455
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:53,510
better concerts coping skills so that's
where you

456
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:57,630
good to learn because Google designed it
in such a way that

457
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:01,840
something more so than to raise are a

458
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,140
implementing as part of their concerts
gripping protection thing

459
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:09,190
and how you can bypass those things so
this is good there were five levels

460
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:12,370
and a it was dedicated

461
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:15,450
only to cross its gripping but then
others

462
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:20,669
so Yahoo Yahoo recently %uh I think
woman's back baby released up secular

463
00:29:20,669 --> 00:29:25,140
into now from last year they have opened
up and it was interesting

464
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:29,350
a team in New York Chris ralph is
leading the team

465
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:33,809
so they are doing some good things
recently there

466
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:37,360
published and bring I'm Italy's Dendreon
its that such a fucking

467
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,360
so object lives they've been good rule
again

468
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,730
it's coming from Google up I don't want
to be her Google

469
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:46,909
everything we would get it is there it
is

470
00:29:46,909 --> 00:29:50,100
it has again design talent is considered
a sporty the

471
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:54,070
good thing about grower is it has

472
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:57,470
solutions as well so wants you

473
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:00,909
saw the challenge you get to know how
you can I should

474
00:30:00,909 --> 00:30:04,679
so and you don't we just saw how you can
do a cross-site scripting

475
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:08,100
but its not complete you

476
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:12,480
as part of our job we not only have to
find the holes

477
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,630
but we have to patch them we have to
recommend what

478
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:19,160
one can do what plan can do but is on
the toilet ability

479
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:23,090
and that's where I like who were in the
end

480
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:27,040
so this CD if Thailand is on land and
challenges are cool

481
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,980
but this link your 53 big deal

482
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:34,080
light up a balk threw up on the
challenges

483
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,470
its good because I am NOT able to solve
everything

484
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:41,530
what I have curiosity

485
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:46,680
I'm interested in learning how others
have started I go to decide i'd

486
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:51,020
they have want of ordered Islanders with
different items

487
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:54,370
so I was able to solve something in 1b

488
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:58,770
what I want to know how other disorders
applauded that's where this is going

489
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:02,470
because I get to know five different
techniques to solve the same thing

490
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:06,250
next time if my technique will not not
not work and buy something it's

491
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:09,360
so I love this so

492
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,610
you can just search walk-throughs offer
tedious online tenders

493
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:20,000
and you'll be able to fine you picnics
so moving ahead

494
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,140
CBS so most CPF

495
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:26,820
the prime where you something but
generally

496
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,840
if you are on over the wire are save

497
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,360
aP's part alerted anything apart from
learning get

498
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,110
learning is the big thing they don't be
dollars so how

499
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:40,260
how you can make it work so

500
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:44,720
reported the hat a we can this go ahead
with the responsible disclosure

501
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,290
but it's it's part of a money so

502
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:51,640
be have guard a rare talent

503
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,010
you know we can find to go to devote the
whole weekend leverage

504
00:31:55,010 --> 00:32:00,670
our talent our skins and making money
crew responsible disclosures

505
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:03,870
yeah because because we are whiter
although there's a big market black

506
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:04,780
market but

507
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:08,880
you can sell your exploits and when
nobody's but no would be a white

508
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,960
so we will do is going to a disco and

509
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:17,030
it it's it's kind of cool because I'll
most of the company's DP a lot of

510
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,500
attention to security who's

511
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,310
and be buffet

512
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:24,640
and retrieval you know looking to pick
up security on a peaceful security of

513
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,510
whom insecurity

514
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,720
they did they are being good engine
AdWords security

515
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,360
well abilities and that's where if you
bypass those things

516
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,560
that means the picnic is super cool

517
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,610
it get to me even for him

518
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:42,720
and I'm most other companies that have a
I love pangs I love playing

519
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,040
your name listed in their site has
security researcher

520
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:51,560
and at the same time they do have about
bounty program so they pay you money

521
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,810
for finding goes in there's a good in
their infrastructure

522
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:58,830
systems application everything so it
gives you a chance to make some money

523
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,950
and if you are a student

524
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:03,980
if you want to make something extra it
it's it's kind of cool

525
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:08,390
where you learn something at the same
time somebody's been you so

526
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:11,840
and last thing is been need

527
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,960
rushed from the community if I

528
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,220
disclose my butt in openly

529
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:23,490
before giving one governors its not we
will lose trust from in the community

530
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:26,520
and that something that I was discussing
yesterday

531
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:31,460
weapon some governors are feeling
disgruntled be the artist under

532
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:35,130
no you so last min Microsoft and Google
had a big

533
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:38,460
Braun had that that there were no white
men

534
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:42,050
%um predicts you disclosed about it was
not

535
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:45,610
prized so we need trust from lenders

536
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:49,180
so what are those the awards and now we
have

537
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:53,580
seen responsible disclosure is good
thing it will give you

538
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:57,090
girder name cream hinman

539
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:01,300
so what are those really awards how you
can do it so this is a

540
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,330
will post you know Facebook's

541
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:07,750
a bug bounty program baby did really
appreciate

542
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:12,050
design and pirated books the

543
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:16,350
appreciated a a lot so if you are
reporting something to Google

544
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:20,450
you have to demonstrate ways to extract
you guys to meet up

545
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:23,710
you have to demonstrate that it will
good execution how you are able to

546
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:26,940
execute orders over and everything
whereas

547
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,620
for Facebook their priorities their big
biggest concern so if you

548
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,460
demonstrative be

549
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:35,240
that you can view others

550
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,369
beat-up then the will be like anything
so

551
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:43,730
better up but bounty programs are
pleased so

552
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:47,059
Google a again as a pioneer the day
started

553
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:50,569
wettability research program yet be

554
00:34:50,569 --> 00:34:54,159
Ando be are doing money to

555
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,280
soldiers the start appreciating their
efforts

556
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,319
and better starter recently

557
00:35:00,319 --> 00:35:03,630
a no: think we're there was no
competition

558
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:07,069
onto onto every year during can
sequester it's a conference

559
00:35:07,069 --> 00:35:10,150
so can sequester has a specific

560
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,530
program ongoing for

561
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:16,940
researchers from all over the world to
come and tribal hi

562
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:20,140
high-profile targets like chrome

563
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:25,630
Firefox Safari your Adobe Flash
delighted is this your dollars not be

564
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,650
so and they try to go out money

565
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:33,369
so law student would ease the paid more
than a fifty thousand dollars

566
00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:36,410
so its it it's quick money it's good way

567
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:39,569
on the you have to be BK

568
00:35:39,569 --> 00:35:43,559
very best to hike grew more anything and
busier

569
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:47,099
so it concluded therefore yesterday and
these other numbers

570
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:50,619
by said from them and this year the bird

571
00:35:50,619 --> 00:35:53,819
442 public dollars that's huge

572
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:57,440
you know the skins if you tried skills

573
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,589
in your lab learn things on your own

574
00:36:00,589 --> 00:36:03,809
and finally you a good look into
question her

575
00:36:03,809 --> 00:36:07,430
get groomed down in getting lot of me

576
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:12,190
but that's what Google Inc is we've been
big chart

577
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:16,150
the small companies if your mom a small
company by 12

578
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:19,270
I'll find researchers where can I find
researchers

579
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:23,890
who can report good books to me I'm
ready to pay them something

580
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:27,680
so there is this new phenomena coming

581
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,270
there are platforms they are asking

582
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:36,569
small companies are up for that matter
even big companies because you'll win

583
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:39,650
it'll be out there

584
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:43,130
I'd always did a so hacker one

585
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:46,240
then there is up but at all

586
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,750
sendak and Calgary so

587
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:53,859
let me pause here and give you a brief
description about these platforms

588
00:36:53,859 --> 00:36:57,710
so what do they do is the post programs

589
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:00,890
but bounty programs so consider I'm
accompany

590
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:04,940
a where want researchers who hacked my
system

591
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:08,849
the I will contact one of these programs
and hack

592
00:37:08,849 --> 00:37:12,109
unearned host my program on this they
have

593
00:37:12,109 --> 00:37:15,410
many researchers kinda

594
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:18,990
all the researchers get a chance to look
into the application

595
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:22,579
and the report bugs I'm part of on the
communities

596
00:37:22,579 --> 00:37:27,010
and they have different up for Mac so
high Kevin are one good thing about how

597
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:27,609
common is

598
00:37:27,609 --> 00:37:31,430
their public disclosures once you report

599
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:34,880
so you reporters up and your YouTube or
somebody to accompany a

600
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,550
and the Badger they give you to art
everything is done

601
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:42,790
now you have something called his public
discredit you can ask the vendor

602
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:47,410
disclose the but publicly that has two
advantages

603
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:50,619
one vendor gets transparent

604
00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:54,510
up but fixing think so the

605
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:58,220
people were using the printer they have
more pre

606
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:01,059
in there and that's only because they
know that these guys are fighting

607
00:38:01,059 --> 00:38:01,760
something

608
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,150
and is the way the patch who had an
advantage for the researchers will

609
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:09,619
because he get to publish his books
somewhere

610
00:38:09,619 --> 00:38:13,849
and direct communication with the vendor
so ya who is a

611
00:38:13,849 --> 00:38:17,170
one of the mmm big as a bigger

612
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:20,430
company who is on her current one on her
current

613
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:24,180
and yes so different

614
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,400
about but programs in fact there are
different they don't disclosed books

615
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,099
publicly

616
00:38:28,099 --> 00:38:31,540
what that my person that doesn't
disclose their plans publicly

617
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:35,140
to consider your company you are Bank of
America you don't want

618
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:38,369
others to see if you are asking so just
to

619
00:38:38,369 --> 00:38:42,069
exploit them human contact someone likes
an act it started from

620
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:45,640
2x anything that is Ando baby

621
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,900
it it's very exclusive program because

622
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,720
UK

623
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,590
a researcher cannot define a beer yes to

624
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:56,960
go through a test yes to heart
particular website and then

625
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,530
report was report writing is very
crucial

626
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:04,020
and penetration testing so here

627
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:07,550
that this your report writing skills
your hacking skills and then only

628
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:13,800
you are confirmed as a penetration
tester so that's

629
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,350
kind of would because you are in testing
their abilities are

630
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:21,180
attackers as well %um assembled report I
just big

631
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:26,010
few reports from hacker 1 like

632
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:29,300
how do we reported so now I'm coming to
the

633
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,940
topic where we have traveled a lot

634
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:37,100
we started with creating art lab be have
left some screens

635
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:40,640
replied to skills on live programs like
sepia

636
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,630
then removed two words on main
challenges

637
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:48,270
and now we are reporting bugs who

638
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:51,850
vendors directly so it's like hacking
completely

639
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:55,160
but its under responsible disclosure

640
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,630
it under limit will be good a

641
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:01,690
a scope so we who will artist you know

642
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:05,790
under the described the school what are
the things that are available to hack

643
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:09,050
and then we tried as those things and
funny reporter

644
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:13,100
to reporting is the key because

645
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:16,759
you have to convey your ideas bill and

646
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,150
it has to be a professional former so

647
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:23,700
this is this is my the one of my report

648
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:27,460
for store process could well as curbing
that the same thing that

649
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:31,630
I sure do the same thing I have reported
so it's it's not about being

650
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:35,000
preloaded support be place where I
pondered

651
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,890
so technique was important so these are
you can report

652
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:43,550
and in the same format you can do a
public disclosure

653
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:48,340
earned get paid know when

654
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:52,220
talk about but bounty programs it's
quite lucrative it it's it's it's

655
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:55,830
quite fine see you know you you get a
lot of money

656
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:59,380
people are being you for finding bugs
and

657
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,750
hacking hacking gives you a question

658
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,940
you you are on your toes when you are
hiding something

659
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:09,150
but there are some things that we should
follow was a member we on white

660
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:13,280
soap Force thing I want to

661
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:19,060
recommended write the country's the
proper steps to reproduce: maybe it's

662
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,150
not the language you know maybe you are
not familiar with english-language

663
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:25,390
it's not a problem but riding a black
writing

664
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:29,560
Wednesday's report and steps is really
important they were translated

665
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:33,070
in English but stepside important in
know how to do it

666
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:38,380
mixed is cool scope is really important
to remember my first light

667
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:42,270
the difference between attackers and for
investors is the permission

668
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:46,250
so if you don't have permission then you
should not based

669
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:49,800
they will be furious and

670
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,810
in sort of giving you reward they will
just put you behind bars

671
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:56,270
so always remember the school

672
00:41:56,270 --> 00:42:01,690
and how you are reporting this big
defender darkened

673
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:05,590
so in my practice so room but last year
some guy

674
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:09,340
reported about to Facebook and somehow

675
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:12,760
is with misplaced that report and they
did not respond to the

676
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:16,730
researcher propping in due time tried
contacting

677
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:21,920
them again but they were not iron what
happened what what he did is

678
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,890
ultimately I be it actually

679
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:29,130
prescod he was furious against Facebook

680
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:32,230
he posted something on marks a I'm

681
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:36,630
using back well at a pretty and bags
something which is not

682
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:42,680
good should not get yourself into a
situation where you are disclosing

683
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,580
the book publicly without implemented or
giving respect

684
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:50,110
to end so that's where please we've got
fuel is there not

685
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:53,340
be him and up but community stirred

686
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:56,970
a with the researcher because he had a
good case that

687
00:42:56,970 --> 00:43:02,790
it was not responding but yes I i've
recommend a highly to respect the

688
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:03,380
vendors

689
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:06,770
and in the end do not copy paste

690
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:11,110
so with public disclosure you get to see
others research you get to see at this

691
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:11,770
technique

692
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:14,480
and what's happening is people are just
pop in peace

693
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,460
themes you it's good to

694
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:22,119
get the picnic it's good to learn new
techniques but show some respect to the

695
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:22,910
researchers so

696
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:26,140
up 0 so even predict if I

697
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:29,400
detected by they're doing good so franz

698
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,430
kinda unfrozen is someone with

699
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:36,109
from Rick debating he pondered well
everything a boom in

700
00:43:36,109 --> 00:43:41,020
subduing biko and I I i saw a report
which was completely on

701
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:45,420
they'd October and don't mention
anything about accrediting

702
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:48,720
be willing to do front of building will
be dignified lives

703
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,450
and acts back tonight how our community
books

704
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:57,059
vvv like open community but we respect
each other

705
00:43:57,059 --> 00:44:00,829
bit you'd expect fellow hikers to burn
copies

706
00:44:00,829 --> 00:44:04,780
and the that brings me to the end of

707
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:09,230
mine presentation so and in in in
conclusion

708
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,829
what word as hackers practice ground on

709
00:44:12,829 --> 00:44:16,329
why we need in how we can go along learn

710
00:44:16,329 --> 00:44:20,049
hiking different targets and finally
reporting bugs to

711
00:44:20,049 --> 00:44:23,069
up potential vendor so

712
00:44:23,069 --> 00:44:27,880
my post when I was writing conclusion I
was thinking why

713
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:32,470
why do we need and how it it goes sold
rapid skill development

714
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:35,540
is key to success and security everyday
your

715
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:38,829
looking into new do means

716
00:44:38,829 --> 00:44:43,099
new areas where we are getting new
technologies

717
00:44:43,099 --> 00:44:46,220
so its really important but us as

718
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:50,530
hackers good used to the the technology
and find

719
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:53,730
security group in back so

720
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:57,359
we have to be on our toes and we cannot
find

721
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:01,650
everything not embrace we cannot find
everything every hardware

722
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:06,370
so we can used we have to look allowed
we have written a book practice good

723
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:10,730
and take anything from most Olympic
spirit from a master's experience

724
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:14,350
because beat everything lasso during my
courses

725
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:18,090
my professors were kind enough show me
some resources

726
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:22,340
some techniques whatnot everything
because

727
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:26,100
I'm is valuable did you have to go out a
lot of things

728
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,860
and if I am interest earned hiking a
particular thing

729
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:33,060
it it's mine does it start in the
interest of all

730
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:38,100
blast so if you want to learn something
you have to develop your own lab

731
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:41,110
and start practicing I'm

732
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:44,760
on his one abilities we are curious kids

733
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,000
I am one of them I want to but I and
best

734
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,250
everything and it's not easy

735
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:54,980
for me protest everything I don't find a
server

736
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:58,420
which is vulnerable to show Chuck I
don't find a server

737
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:01,690
level too hard nude in the way what they
do is

738
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:06,220
I develop lab I i install that
particular server which

739
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:09,870
a little too hard and bested against my
exploits

740
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:13,140
so backs over this is really important

741
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:17,210
I in the end defense so

742
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:20,520
if you see why we need penetration
testing

743
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:24,100
it's because we need to find out these
before hackers

744
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:27,100
hack are infrastructure so defense

745
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:31,370
is the key and it will be designed bill
in my opinion it can be designed

746
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:34,400
Breville if we know our akers back

747
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,040
so this is the pre mice and we should

748
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:42,130
no how I quote how to do it back and

749
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:46,990
other but that's kind of cool tune not
back is the best with a different this a

750
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:51,630
but here I'm just resting a bit so
that's that's that's pretty much

751
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:55,360
everything what I heard in my slides and

752
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:59,720
I have 10 minutes left so I'll and the
questions

753
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:03,150
anything that have in mind I would the
presentation

754
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:08,470
and

755
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:08,720
yep
