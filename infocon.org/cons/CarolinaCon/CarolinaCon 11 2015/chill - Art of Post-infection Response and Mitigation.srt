00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,890
the 14 I'll still be here this one onto

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,370
okay so

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,550
how many have you are new to Caroline
Connan still here

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,660
that explains a lot

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,590
I thank you

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:23,580
arm every a every other person that's
prolly been here for years no the

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,380
knows that attendance kind of wall
diminishes

8
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:30,410
on Sunday for various things that
happened on Saturday night so

9
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:37,410
arm dude windows just shut down

10
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:41,559
so

11
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:45,409
first I'm gonna show you how to rearm
windows 7 the this a

12
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:50,049
arm year network tester

13
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:57,049
on gonna complain again

14
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,970
I haven't had the same thing connect to
the network hope I'm it's a feature

15
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,480
I agree I'm just personal Microsoft
every

16
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,810
reaching your anyone hears from
Microsoft arm

17
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:15,180
I'd don't want me so don't try to give
you one

18
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,880
so are yet thanks for coming out
hopefully this'll

19
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,970
they in night get shut down for piracy
again

20
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:26,440
are so the Arco postinfection response
mitigation

21
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,550
what the hell just happened on the
network there may be a question here

22
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,360
quite often

23
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,950
shame on you may be questioning boss
asks you

24
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:41,950
maybe a question that you ask yourself
you think this is a lot dumber some shit

25
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,619
um in artistry

26
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,040
for Windows so

27
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,880
with the whole just happen on my network
are hopefully after

28
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,259
we're done here today I can help me find
out

29
00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:00,630
so base in this park is basically about

30
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,650
having an IT department are or some

31
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,960
instance where you may have security
people but not really

32
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,970
arm love IT departments don't have some
other

33
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:13,810
someone that specializes in an hour and
demoted

34
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,209
are so that's basically what this park
is about

35
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:22,980
under the good stuff when ames Caleb I
love people call me chill

36
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,940
what people tell me to chill arm some
people say and chill

37
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,570
just depends on how much I've had to
drink when you catch up with me

38
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:35,260
arm right now I'm gonna see our I was
going to work out today

39
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:40,299
amatzia Mauer analyst a the media trust
them you trust those nothing

40
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:44,220
that has to do with the paw just in case
you know you wanted to know

41
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,040
are the me to trust those cummick clough
our mitigation

42
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:53,299
I you Mourinho's you know about critical
things in a play with them

43
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:56,950
if I know what to do and I tell our
customers what they do

44
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:00,590
and a stop doing them I'm the founder
the telecoms you know

45
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,580
I like to thank everyone for coming out
also if our

46
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:08,620
everyone's interested next year you have
in action again

47
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,810
every year strong for six years in
thanks for coming out

48
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,560
on Friday up dirty white house I

49
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,380
my opinion you can't really be in the
security industry without doing some TV

50
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,100
shit

51
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,440
if you consider yourself a string up
quite how

52
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:30,470
mmm I it I'm sorry you have to do these
things to be in the upper second history

53
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:35,080
you have to bend your ethics sometimes
to do things to learn more

54
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,010
are so just keep that in mind when
questioning yourself

55
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,830
sure I actually do this world can get
you arrested don't do it but if it's not

56
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,150
just on your home network

57
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:47,510
and test machines that like that please
do it learn more

58
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:52,630
arm and I'm your huckleberry that has
nothing to do with anything

59
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,090
just my favorite quote ever from best
movie ever made

60
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,870
and if you come this you know sometimes
I'm your huckleberry

61
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,030
so on to the good stuff

62
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,680
are we're gonna covers the gray area
which is postinfection

63
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,110
are a lot of people really doe think
about what happens after you get

64
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,890
infected what people think about

65
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:16,609
levels before then and a lot of people
think about what happens after the

66
00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:17,760
infection is gone

67
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,169
there's no real talk about with the
whole happen just now

68
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:25,840
on my network so after that we're gonna
go over some our brief responses

69
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,430
awesome planning and our temple so

70
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:33,940
gonna show just a few tools that I find
really really interesting

71
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,470
and gonna go over some methods

72
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:41,370
to find new tools other than the ones
I'm about to show you I

73
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,700
so away we go why is postinfection

74
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,860
a gray area Inc can anyone tell me

75
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,360
why why it's such a weird place to

76
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,810
hang out yep

77
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:01,060
that is through its literally different
every single time whether it be the

78
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,650
perhaps files that you're dealing with
home infection

79
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:11,650
was your here is a restructuring

80
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,020
yeah although I haven't found one

81
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:30,690
Mauer author except contractors for a
government that actually populate their

82
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,330
software

83
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:38,330
correct

84
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:45,150
are and I'll get to that actually so are

85
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:48,910
I've outlined three main reasons why
it's a gray area

86
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:54,140
are good answers 1 I've main reasons is
over-reliant on antivirus

87
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,240
arm we got a we were good

88
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,940
you know we'll never did in fact in if
we do we can just call the V company

89
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,280
sweet simple as that will have an
infection

90
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,620
outta here in no time well the final
time and

91
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,320
you know you may have an infection in
network what the hell happened

92
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:16,280
armoured 8 anti virus is not what it
used to be it's not

93
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,550
the first layer security should have
against viruses

94
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:23,610
it's no longer that semantic and other
people say

95
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:27,490
your antivirus is dead it's not
unfortunately tonight

96
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:31,870
its it's kind of annoying but it's not
dead yet it still required as

97
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,200
security layer it's not what it used to
be used for though

98
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,020
in palmer's right now is used for a
breach a learning mechanism

99
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:43,070
while 100 times it may stop something
from getting on your network

100
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:48,130
as a whole their store backs though they
are going to get on your network

101
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:51,580
I'll anti-virus will alert you

102
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:56,690
want to block and that's only if you
have your admin console setup correctly

103
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:00,870
a all those damn emails they keep
calling your inbox that you made a

104
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,830
folder for that same our alerts

105
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:06,580
want to keep ignoring thats your AV

106
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,770
actually doing its correct all been
letting you know your network is

107
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,770
breached it's not telling you how it's
preached

108
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:16,100
it's not telling you why but it's saying
hey you know

109
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:20,150
you should probably check this out %uh a
lot of people just ignore that

110
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,540
are sauce you know if you ever saw per
year

111
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:28,530
organization great but not everyone has
that very large corporations that don't

112
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,720
have a saw

113
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,330
in the may contract their stuff out with
Amy just how I keep people

114
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,000
and a lot

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,080
the ministers actually art that the
employer's Mauer

116
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,870
you know how to handle it you know what
to do with it an

117
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,900
thats pretty much the base the start
another reason

118
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:50,259
a people there's a gray area is more
persistence techniques

119
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:54,560
appeasing hours on your system in it
doesn't want you to know it's there

120
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,860
you're probably not going to know if
their letter actually penalizing inbox

121
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,470
every day

122
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:03,630
if apiece from our is popping up in it a
fake antivirus in front view

123
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:07,630
and you know Jake in HR keeps trying to
the importer

124
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,990
obviously it's not trying to hide itself
trying persist trying to

125
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:15,070
store you in some way crypto Walker I
mean if you know a trip to lockers in

126
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:15,750
this room

127
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,310
start googling just don't get a Google
Images cuz you prolly get ripped a

128
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:19,849
locker

129
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:23,750
arm so yeah are persistent techniques

130
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,669
you not in the know it's there and it
goes hand in hand with a reliance on

131
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:27,490
antivirus

132
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:31,169
if you're ignoring these alerts and it's
telling you it's there

133
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:34,310
you know and you're not doing anything
about it it's actually your problem not

134
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,740
Jake an HR who keeps dragging the window
down

135
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,820
the corn screen doesn't know any better
of your fault for not training take a

136
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,500
little better

137
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,070
in restricting his access so third thing
is

138
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:50,220
really just lack have exposure in
training how mean you work

139
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,990
in an IT department at some level okay

140
00:08:54,990 --> 00:09:01,570
only if you have I'm our person will
surprising

141
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:05,260
arm last time I do this there were no
hands

142
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,720
%uh so that's actually really good by

143
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,779
it's the IT departments that don't have
that person

144
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:15,970
and it doesn't take certification it
doesn't take anything like that I mean

145
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:19,899
you too is now serve occasion you can
find a lot of stuff on YouTube you can

146
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:20,450
find

147
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:25,240
lot of sites out there that just have
information about were viruses hang out

148
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,130
and just some stuff you can do to
initially looked every single removal

149
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,089
article you read about in covers

150
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:35,820
dis removing viruses its gonna start of
the same way and it's going to take you

151
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,940
through the same senate directories and
configure it seems that

152
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,850
the is the steps documented in with your
something is your organization

153
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:46,410
you know your're two steps ahead again
don't have call you baby

154
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,639
opening colliery be company on top
anything else

155
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:54,209
you're giving way a potential target
attack to an AB company that

156
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:57,209
really gives know shits that it was a
targeted attack they just want the

157
00:09:57,209 --> 00:09:57,829
symbols

158
00:09:57,829 --> 00:10:01,910
so they detected on other people's
machines so

159
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:05,800
yeah train people get them some exposure
to Mauer

160
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,839
on there's basically three

161
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:12,310
respond house you can pay one similar
infection

162
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:16,240
want you find out about one way or
another weathered some complaining

163
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,670
re finally check rebbe see ol hey it's
up to date

164
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:23,470
oh yeah by the way they receive 1000
alerts from a

165
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:26,540
you know home in finance to you with the
whole

166
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,670
looks like a worm aren t were those be
all this the automation

167
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:35,290
so if you have someone trained if you
have some exposed how to handle Mauer in

168
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:35,939
it at least

169
00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:39,379
do kinda minor now sits on it it's
really gonna better put your

170
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:40,800
organization more than just

171
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,220
relying on your antivirus company or you
have contractors that are

172
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,800
doing security in you the No about an
hour

173
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,730
you know asked them or you know have
them release some information

174
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:56,170
here on stuff people about what to do in
the situation

175
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:01,019
its really common sense into getting the
not so common sense

176
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:06,529
when you encounter piece from our so the
three respond housing in part well

177
00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:10,620
first 13 image seconds the ETF

178
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:15,600
on the third ones basically remove one
analysis which in my opinion

179
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,240
is the most proper way to go every
single infection no matter what

180
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,230
I'll I'm exhausted we are not were so
just bear with me

181
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:26,709
%uh the first how public talk about his
rematch

182
00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:30,839
and if you have been a sysadmin or an IT
person in this room

183
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:34,259
you know they're it's the fastest way to
get someone

184
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:37,639
back into their work it's about this way
the

185
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:41,319
you may be required to do by your higher
ups you know

186
00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:44,569
new campaign that thing get about maybe
a quick recovery

187
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:47,949
which is the plus by if your gonna do
this

188
00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:52,639
theory into machines you know look a
little bit in the word image

189
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,140
are reimaging is basically your through

190
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59,520
clean image on top reinstall the
software gonna go

191
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:04,020
checks back getting viruses on his
finance machine sweet are

192
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:08,200
to if your gonna do this practice only
seen in Kung Fu

193
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,180
and all easy man Kung Fu is is kung fu
make lazy man's

194
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,930
or admins are required to do this kind
of thing just be in a better place after

195
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:17,580
happens

196
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:21,770
so is Windows seven box you know there
tell me to reimage it

197
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:25,120
what should I do law take an image for
yourself

198
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,560
you know it don't know I mean don't just
in the Windows

199
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,480
to connect for travel you to a secondary
environment image that drive

200
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,080
you know image to partition image the
main partition

201
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,990
remains on to VM play with them a little
bit see what the heck's going on

202
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:45,830
i mean to you should know what's going
on anyway split

203
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:50,690
just have an image if anything if you're
not even gonna do anything with that

204
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:51,210
image

205
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:55,080
in your higher ups are staying at which
the prime explain to them it's not

206
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,990
because

207
00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:01,070
if anything you have a organically
infected machine

208
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:04,900
that you can play with on your own time
and learn this stuff

209
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:09,090
so you don't have to call your TV
company you have like 45 images that got

210
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,270
infected throughout your

211
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:14,330
organization if different factions on
they may be targeted they may not be

212
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,160
targeted by

213
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,550
you never know unless you actually look
dumb look at what they're trying to

214
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,210
steal

215
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:22,870
or just you know have a central
withholding to do

216
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:26,770
in the first place when this occurs if
you see something

217
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:30,720
part in QuickBooks files not a good
thing but you wouldn't know

218
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,480
rebbe company is not going to tell you
that back not going to be someone else's

219
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,050
report

220
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:38,440
they're gonna closure case because
that's what they want to do they want to

221
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,700
get your computer

222
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,450
back to whatever kinda weird Workington
condition it was in the first place

223
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:47,790
an just you know close the case so

224
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,990
the second half a minute talk about is a

225
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:54,100
a path that a lot of people follow in I
don't understand

226
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,380
I use the leading our response team at
my former company

227
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:02,190
and so the W first saw

228
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:05,250
doesn't just and for what it stands for
why

229
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,660
and its sometime stands for
accommodation

230
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:12,430
what what because you're so perplexed
what you're being told

231
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:16,030
know what will well why what Lake

232
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:19,040
basically what happens a breach occurs

233
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,790
an ignore or you're admitting North

234
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:28,120
they keep using the computer like a the
example Jake an HR

235
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,360
polling the if they gave easy

236
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,950
watched under the edge in the screen
just so you can keep using the computer

237
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:38,440
I mean they may have gotten hit with the
word explain are still using were there

238
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,880
still typing directly into it

239
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,560
crazy and I've been on networks where

240
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,240
they have still been using everything
that infected

241
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,430
for months and then the cause and
they're like

242
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,550
know we need to know what have we lost
like point thousand dollars in last

243
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,340
month how

244
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,460
in all they gotta holdover Bank
Financial somehow

245
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:04,490
well in check the timestamps on some
this Mauer

246
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:08,460
it's been there for months and I mean as
much as Mauer can actually

247
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,690
manipulate the time stamp himself look

248
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:15,140
you'll find either compile or some
little while its gonna

249
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,890
indicate that these people have been
infected actively

250
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:24,150
with your non Lake this Mauer doesn't
even care that it knows

251
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:28,620
like is poppin screens a pre Mauer just
16 story in some way

252
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,180
but they keep using it in a matter of
hours notice

253
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:37,480
so they keep checking these connections
all the sudden there

254
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,910
away this is a company this isn't like
someone's grandmother

255
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:44,150
let's just remote in roadway

256
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:47,710
and in the world and Matt in the loop
crazy stuff

257
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:51,130
in your network because what else would
they do

258
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:58,130
that's whether there in the first place
have a question

259
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,940
understand but what the fuck why are you
still using it

260
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,540
like all I can say

261
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:22,280
when someone tells me they're still
using a machine with infection on

262
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:26,020
after months you important what

263
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:31,710
like I i've been using this machine all
don't worry it's just more runs our

264
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,510
QuickBooks

265
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:37,440
RTP is on the server no problem
configures barone here for like a year

266
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,230
so

267
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,840
yet don't be don't be these people
nonprofit I

268
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,070
if you find these people correct their
behavior

269
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:52,240
because if you know these people and
they know you're in the security in some

270
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:52,960
aspect

271
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,790
and they don't have security people in
their IT realization

272
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:00,170
polling in Astoria asking you some
questions an

273
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:03,090
you're gonna find it's a ridiculous on
the situation you're not going to help

274
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:03,450
them

275
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:07,350
or you're going to reconsider lost cause
because some networks

276
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:10,550
are so badly infected their freedom lost
cause

277
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:14,010
if they have servers are booting up the
oil patch on

278
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:17,709
Arts on talking about a a Windows 2000
Server

279
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:21,540
on Friday that you know they still have
to actively support

280
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,630
scary but legacy become one you know

281
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:29,310
from logging on public leader for 4 for
5 on your Windows 2000 Server and

282
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:32,980
use in like 10 twelve-year-old exploits
that still work

283
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:36,310
there's a huge issue so

284
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:39,960
the path I want to talk about the most
other than

285
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,150
arm sleazy admins and potentially

286
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:47,020
high-functioning individuals there are
very very special

287
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:50,250
are room one elses

288
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,960
every time you find an infection

289
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,910
or you get alerted to an infection this
is the path any

290
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,580
you should pay here in this room for a
reason became this care line upon

291
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,660
this weekend learn about security in
style please please please

292
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,900
now hours very prominent hours when the
biggest things

293
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,960
in the news right now because people can
stop it

294
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,620
it's not if your gonna get infected it's
when

295
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:20,940
if you're planning not to get infected
the 10 know what planet you live on

296
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,090
because everyone gets infected

297
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:26,920
doesn't matter if you know high-security
doesn't matter anything

298
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,910
are you're gonna get infected I give
this part and

299
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:36,340
Arlington I mean Abreu maybe four weeks
ago and I the guy asked well you know

300
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:40,220
I was Mauer get around perimeter
defenses like you by rampant anything I

301
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:40,710
would have

302
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:44,740
perimeter the blocks all this well

303
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,010
I think it's murder actually talked
about a little bit I inflict upon to

304
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:51,060
flash drives and drop in the parking lot

305
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:55,390
or I'd walk in in just Hannah flash
drive the secretary

306
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,530
or whoever was up there they don't know

307
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:03,190
all yeah this is for ball there's a ball
that works there somewhere

308
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:06,290
problem in the if you drop in the
parking lot

309
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:09,990
he dropped ten flash drives with an
all-around buyers

310
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:13,860
the parking lot guaranteed someone's
gonna pick one up

311
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,610
someone's gonna wonder what is on the
flashdrive

312
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:20,640
as soon as they put in their machine
bless you

313
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,230
Endpoint Protection which is ever take a
joke

314
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:30,620
arm you're screwed and you can't
pinpoint who isn't gonna pick up flash

315
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,010
drive unless you make your organization
where

316
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:36,590
don't think of laughter out in the
parking lot you know bring them to

317
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:40,590
the IT office if you find them don't
think about that stuff but it's not

318
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:44,490
if you're gonna get infected its when
you're gonna get infected again

319
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:48,400
it doesn't matter you get up people
bringing their own devices in

320
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,730
their are actively infected in the use
it as have a point they didn't even know

321
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:53,910
it was a pivotal point in

322
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:57,810
in toll all the sudden the pain with use
it like to be in with stats

323
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:02,080
on that particular right like all shit
you know it's connecting the speed test

324
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,520
comcast in like San Jose all the sudden
this

325
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,360
DSL connection formerly DSL connection
is able to transmit like

326
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,500
and make the second G you know

327
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,010
this looks good I'm glad we in fact that
the slut part you know let's

328
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:19,980
get on this laptop wallet active on the
fly and see what else is on the network

329
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:24,150
so some stuff to do basically in the
remote

330
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:27,240
myer blood removal and analysis are

331
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,450
power first thing is pains in their
memory dumps

332
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:34,620
are volatility framework is a great
thing

333
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,020
its not argues just for basic memory

334
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,410
analysis their tools

335
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:45,570
the Windows makes they are good for
getting these

336
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,770
are I'm gonna go over a couple East
Falls but

337
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:52,010
yet get a memory dump a lot of us have

338
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:56,920
remote offices and the remote offices
may have a crappy DSL connection or

339
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,480
something

340
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,330
you may have an instance where you have
to use TeamViewer to get on the infected

341
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:01,890
machine

342
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:06,520
now if you wanna transfer 6 King memory
dump thirteen-year

343
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,080
law if you have secure VPN stuff

344
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,250
though like setup still good luck it's a
16 gig memory dull

345
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:18,740
leisure analyzing on that machine you're
not gonna wanna rate went around for

346
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,550
this by the time he went around four

347
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:23,970
whoever's actually controlling them she
might see you doing this

348
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:27,840
in just set the machine 0 or I seen it
tripwire

349
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,290
and disable the neck so you can't do
that anymore are

350
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:36,160
some hours very aggressive if you can't
get a full member don't get a process

351
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:36,790
memory go

352
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:39,920
I'm gonna be gone over that period
shortly so

353
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,160
packet captures are very important or
people

354
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:47,150
take packet captures a new their minds
basically when they're doing

355
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:52,730
power wires RTCP don't be best friends
if there's an infection

356
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:56,410
on a business machine inside the
organization

357
00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:01,850
don't you wanna know what it's talking
to that machine became organically

358
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:02,600
infected

359
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,920
it was infected in the way that it was
meant to

360
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,070
in fact basically is queen bee

361
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:14,710
is that machine if you rip them our of
machine in writing test environment you

362
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:17,750
may get skew results as far as like
packet captures go

363
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:21,040
or even memory don't because it's
running in an environment

364
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,309
the it technically wasn't designed to
run on less you can fully replicate

365
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:32,309
the infection which may not happen every
time question

366
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,980
just gonna say that

367
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:42,789
arm never do it on a machine I mean i've
seen. viruses that block

368
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:46,559
tools like Sysinternals tools and stuff
like that they listen for them they know

369
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,679
they're very effective

370
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,799
Wireshark is one of them are not even
sure if they make a TCP don't work for

371
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:53,740
Windows but

372
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:57,429
always do on a different machine I mean
always do it

373
00:22:57,429 --> 00:23:00,659
the close as you can get it by you know
just gonna fall

374
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:04,029
capture if you work the organization
it's like easier

375
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:07,549
and if your contractor some like that
you have to get specific permission to

376
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:07,889
get

377
00:23:07,889 --> 00:23:14,889
all capture for the network budget

378
00:23:19,979 --> 00:23:20,899
something by

379
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:26,029
at the same time breaking their
connection to reconnecting is suspicious

380
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:26,749
activity

381
00:23:26,749 --> 00:23:31,200
so you don't know alert they you're
actually looking into this

382
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,869
yet are into you actually get into the
nitty-gritty

383
00:23:34,869 --> 00:23:38,090
I mean disconnecting and reconnecting it
that's fine by

384
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:42,059
they may have other machines are
infected in the just one blips on off

385
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:42,759
really quick

386
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:46,799
and they're actually part in that
organization it AMA Pro Mach they may

387
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:47,190
just

388
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:50,999
you know the kill switch in just knew
the machines are

389
00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:54,710
other thing do some our main much some
our

390
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:57,839
bull meh the menu on our extraction

391
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:03,119
so every time I get on a machine now
that I've dealt with an hour for so long

392
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:06,929
I just have these enter a list of stuff
to go down every single pon

393
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:10,749
what directors to all again program data
on Windows seven

394
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:14,129
you know at the temp files early Tom
folders

395
00:24:14,129 --> 00:24:18,059
everything even like the Windows Recycle
Bin

396
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:21,359
the directories on the back a bit every
time I find something

397
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:25,019
new well that Mauer goes to I added to
mine for a list

398
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:29,589
are a lot of people do with Mauer Mauer
now sits just how these lists of things

399
00:24:29,589 --> 00:24:32,669
where they look immediately arm

400
00:24:32,669 --> 00:24:35,789
so if you can actually get that X he
will file

401
00:24:35,789 --> 00:24:40,450
play with it a little bit in a test
environment with no internet see what it

402
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:40,950
does

403
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:44,679
are the third thing is Carol on the same
track

404
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:48,109
have some kind of made in sandbox
environment setup

405
00:24:48,109 --> 00:24:51,679
there's a low ones you you pay for by
there's

406
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,700
cuckoo have some cummick you set up not
just have

407
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,779
an automated sandbox environment setup
by

408
00:24:58,779 --> 00:25:02,859
think about who has the potential to get
infected in

409
00:25:02,859 --> 00:25:07,119
in your organization so HR runs a
certain so software

410
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:11,539
have an image with that software have a
snapshot a one hr without

411
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:15,299
if finance run special software

412
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:17,820
I know it's a little hard to get
permission to do this sometimes actually

413
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,719
even need after relations but

414
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:24,070
it's worth it run the software on the
finance image

415
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,810
so you can if you find a piece from our
this in your funny

416
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:30,090
former run against the see exactly what
it's looking for

417
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:34,270
if it's looking for stuff actively and
you can see the calls

418
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:38,790
like do some more investigation I mean
this is basically

419
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:42,380
berry simple things that everyone should
be doing

420
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:46,600
you know you should look in New what the
hell's going on with your network

421
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,630
of people though its new can pay

422
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:55,120
or you know it antivirus not he passion
antivirus it's still necessary it's just

423
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,290
not as necessary

424
00:25:56,290 --> 00:26:00,580
are so battle planning

425
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:04,400
have plans made up like I said

426
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,710
don't plan to knock it in fact you're
gonna get infected someone

427
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:11,200
on your network is going to have some
weird little impact in even if it's a

428
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,600
pop

429
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,760
false-positive even if like no nope had
already eighty

430
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,140
automatically start showing up is
infected it might be a false positive

431
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,610
free antivirus

432
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:23,690
white if you're scratching your head

433
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,900
just standing there and you don't know
what to do other than contact your

434
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,090
anti-virus company

435
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:32,750
I mean no pad rahe if I found it was
showing up in my anti-virus

436
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:36,370
as you know infected I'll maybe

437
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:39,770
check the half against some numbers
total to see if anyone actually

438
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:43,040
infect ther has this as an infected so

439
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:48,010
nope had could get infected well if it's
a targeted attack

440
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:51,880
why would I want to upload the virus
total because buyers total is now

441
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,840
owned by people and we all know ok
you've always with information

442
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,180
by you can just check the hash get and
the five

443
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:03,380
in check it on buyers to all they have
the house good luck

444
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:06,690
you look people I mean no one else has a
house

445
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:10,840
in my view heart attack so just do your
due diligence

446
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:15,760
so how some response solution set up
have a little talk a

447
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,060
not everyone has a saw not everyone has

448
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:22,830
e-verify toolkit that they're supposed
to use for every single breach

449
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:27,440
not everyone has that the people do
awesome but the people that don't

450
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,520
should have at least a small pool walks
about locations

451
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,960
that they can use combat the stop

452
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,050
are how multiple defense methods like I
said AB

453
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:42,530
step 1: primer defense you should have
an email filtering stuff like that

454
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:47,150
I mean basic stop after Exchange Server

455
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:51,940
I mean it that's the fence you can never
tell

456
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,270
who's trying to get your network just
think everyone's trying to get my

457
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,380
network but how can I do that came out

458
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:00,420
are also audit your network

459
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:04,060
don't know Jagan finance running

460
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:08,270
15 burns a job law what's wrong with you
I've seen it

461
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:11,540
there's a record its 17 versions of Java

462
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:14,960
starting with Java Runtime Environment
5.0

463
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,710
it's basically a lake if you go into
eating contest for cheeseburger

464
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:23,680
how high can they start the cheeseburger
that's unfortunately that's the

465
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,610
attack vector stock on a lot of people's
machines because they have like 15

466
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,030
virgins a job install

467
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:33,610
how many factors do you need your
running Windows already you're prolly

468
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:38,300
have Flash installed 10 making a job a
party on top of that

469
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:42,340
so ought not work and don't install
dollar

470
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:49,340
question

471
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,039
yeah

472
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:58,909
absolutely

473
00:28:58,909 --> 00:29:03,390
yep baselines are very important see
with the hectic right

474
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:06,390
see what your networks running first
before

475
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:10,210
infection occurs before something occurs
but are

476
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:15,250
back to my job a rant how many have you
actually need job in your organization

477
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:21,000
you need to have job install is it
because

478
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,940
your company runs outdated software yep

479
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:31,159
not run is a lot we run Java Runtime
Environment 5 we can install uninstall

480
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:32,350
that man sorry

481
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:35,870
but you're going to keep getting
infected this is

482
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:40,490
they surf the web on this machine
they're using Java Runtime Environment

483
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:45,179
in their browser to deal with this
legacy software that you're too cheap to

484
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:45,720
operate

485
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,480
you can't prevent that unfortunately you
can rent

486
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:56,480
public Sandboxie question that is great
for like a super corporate IT department

487
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:10,090
by

488
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,340
so

489
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:15,940
I understand where you're coming from 10

490
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:19,549
are I've just seen like nuclear

491
00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:22,549
waste show up from situations like that

492
00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:25,929
you can virtualize it it doesn't mean
it's not going to affect the rest your

493
00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:28,200
environment they have a pivot point

494
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,460
they're gonna go after arm question

495
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:37,740
yep

496
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:41,140
like I said if you

497
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:44,690
if your company actually update sir
software to the latest newest version

498
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:45,419
that they're

499
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:49,399
probably too cheap to upgrade to because
the cost a lot of money in some cases

500
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:55,990
I feel bad for those people then

501
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:59,260
by I'm sane the point is this is
basically

502
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:05,230
if you have to run Java do it but keep
an eye on those notes

503
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:10,240
keep a closer eye on that network
implement something that may keep track

504
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,000
0 the people that have turned the legacy
Java you say they

505
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,179
basically you have have Java installed
its legacy

506
00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:22,470
niche that's fine by not every single
person in your entire company

507
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:27,419
has to use the software like you check
your own machines when you back

508
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:31,220
you know you have to have the install if
you do you have installed

509
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:34,309
is it in a virtual environment up so
yeah

510
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:38,340
if you have to have Java fine well just
keep an eye on the boxes that you

511
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:41,640
especially the ones that have to run
legacy Java which

512
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:45,500
you know it's a lot different use cases
for legacy Java

513
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:49,809
and it's out there so

514
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:53,230
the government's poultry are

515
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:56,799
so I'm gonna go over simple the train
right now arm

516
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,169
just three talls that's it are

517
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:03,580
so the first one a lot of you should re-
have

518
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:07,360
experience with it is process explore

519
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,070
when the most beautiful utilities the
system internals makes

520
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:16,320
for Windows arm you never use
prostitutes or

521
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,070
its

522
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:22,049
past manager the way it always should
have been has major on steroids

523
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:25,950
all the way like big fuckin steroids so

524
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:29,159
the first thing I like to do an open
process for

525
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:33,870
is look at the execution free I just
came across a piece from our

526
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:40,870
last week where Bowers basically using
SMSs to execute and it was spawning from

527
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:42,210
that

528
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:46,080
and then it was wanting to interact to
explore early eighties

529
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:51,600
and it was using those I explorers to do
various things soon as I saw us

530
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,760
anything executing from S&S Estadio

531
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,870
CEO's what the hell's going on but even

532
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:01,380
just little simple things like you know
SBC host

533
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:06,289
doesn't have to be arm does

534
00:33:06,289 --> 00:33:09,580
I'll a lot of people will look at this
and like

535
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:13,130
all you know this is just normal use
services

536
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:16,640
has in Estonian thursday or txt i've
seen

537
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,270
every single process in here injected
into if its executing weird shit or

538
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:24,710
explored ideas he is using like $800k

539
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:28,610
no on that one what to use an 800 K
that's immediately

540
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:32,390
well look at after that as an example
here

541
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:35,580
are you can do individual process stops

542
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:42,580
question

543
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:48,360
right year and actually that's where the
features

544
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:54,600
I was about to get into are but
verifying with Google

545
00:33:54,600 --> 00:34:01,060
AK Bars total is fine way how often do
you see explore the AC running

546
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:05,970
$800k are if you look at the execution
free it just tells a lot about what's

547
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:06,500
going on

548
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,520
immediately are if you see me

549
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,090
if their exporters not open on the
machine and there's like eight of them

550
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:16,910
listed find out where the hell they're
extremely find out what is

551
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:20,260
initiating the Senate's word XQ balls I
mean

552
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:25,850
just looking at this even though I'm
just pardoning the VirtualBox

553
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:29,419
I guess that on here it a serious you
look at it

554
00:34:29,419 --> 00:34:34,250
as a computer person should be so used
to looking at the execution free Windows

555
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:37,260
you sure are you know with suspicious
and what's not

556
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:41,050
are but projects for does have some
really

557
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:45,550
neat built-in tasks like you can create
individual product process toms

558
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,980
you can you in all model searches which
is

559
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:52,360
very handy especially in the case of was
xeroxes

560
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:56,890
I just use this as an example why a
didn't actually have xeroxes installed

561
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:57,640
on this but

562
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:02,630
your access for a long time had a piece
of its artifacts it was just that simple

563
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:06,470
and was hooked and everything so soon as
you get on here

564
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:09,580
everything will pretty much normal we do
handle search

565
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:13,440
in you'd find at some ball basically
injected and everything

566
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,380
in this weird directory that you can get
you through export or txt

567
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:21,220
traditionally are so if you find
artifacts

568
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,610
in my hour look for them look for them
internally in the system

569
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:28,940
you might see a file name in a few doing
in all search on a file name

570
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:33,290
you receive exactly what it's trying to
access or exactly when it swerved into

571
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:36,880
and then you can make a determination on
what to do next if

572
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,540
of if I like five different things open
the services the AC

573
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:44,340
guess what it's trying to persist you
not gonna shut down services da txt on

574
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:44,910
Windows

575
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:48,150
gonna crash immediately which is the
point

576
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:53,470
amid trying to persist through injecting
into that and finally

577
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:55,160
as you point out

578
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,850
arm properties on steroids

579
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:03,200
so as he was pointing out you can
actually do a buyer still have search

580
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,250
within the Properties menu for
prostitutes or nowadays which is fine

581
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:10,390
but just keep in mind targeted tax

582
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:14,080
you really want you wouldn't even have
the hash so

583
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,700
nine times i'd benefits randomly named

584
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:21,190
or if it's just you know to like try to
30 of the bars

585
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:24,980
if it's doing something if someone's
complaining if you're getting a be

586
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,560
alerts

587
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,760
don't bother with buyers total it's
already vires

588
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:33,050
are if you're just not ashore and there
are certain cases where y'all

589
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:36,870
with is this story behavior you know

590
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:41,420
verify the half the fires total it it
doesn't hurt if you're out of shims

591
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:46,010
if you can't figure out if its an I mean
in Barstow may not be a hoe

592
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:49,640
you know this but the six different AB
engines on their what if

593
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,500
30 come up and say the virus and the
other 30 said Queen

594
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:58,220
I mean the usually I only use bar stool
see if it's possible not

595
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:02,130
and old for the turn the major AB
companies to be detecting it

596
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:06,060
if northern detected in only difference
abe is detecting it

597
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:10,280
prolly false-positive by that's kinda
the last thing I go through

598
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,730
before actually dive into arm

599
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:16,970
that's kinda last thing I go through
before

600
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:19,990
on they are a I kinda

601
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:24,480
top how at that point on some other
things you can do

602
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:30,020
you can actually verify the actual
signature VX deal with Microsoft helpful

603
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:34,100
you can can spew that by it is a hopeful
little thing

604
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,670
you look at all the TCP activity and
stuff like that your process tho

605
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:41,380
it also look at the memory and the
actual execute will strings

606
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:44,760
from this properties Paul which

607
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,540
Mauer strings kind everything in the
past but not really

608
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:51,810
on you can see all the API calls its
making including tax

609
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:55,240
if you would the memory strings you may
be able to see

610
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:59,970
I site as connecting to I found in our
form one time just because I looked in

611
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:02,180
the strings inexcusable those actively
running

612
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:06,240
the system it was just some guy that was
like basically

613
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,410
showing everyone what he did on our
think it was open WS

614
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:14,369
by something it's no longer operational

615
00:38:14,369 --> 00:38:21,369
but question

616
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,730
yeah

617
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,600
yeah an I mean again that's

618
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,890
kinda the Barstow ish I'd probably do
that in the background if I actually had

619
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:46,540
have the senate passes for every machine
some corporate environments are so

620
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,340
locked down

621
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:51,290
you know you use W w Slauson stop to get
the

622
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:54,850
updates on but in the world live updates
and exploits

623
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:58,830
up from time to hash list isn't the most
efficient thing to do

624
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:02,160
are but nonetheless a good start

625
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,810
2nd 2011 talk about his dump it

626
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:10,130
it's a statement at all dumped a memory

627
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:13,380
if you're going to do for me all memory
don't dump it

628
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:16,430
Alltel yes tools but this is a very late
we

629
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:20,300
when is excusable that even on the most
infected machines for some reason it

630
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,030
just worked

631
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:25,480
I it's not been blacklisted by EB
authors or anything like that her

632
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,300
sorry AB authors Mauer authors armpit

633
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:33,150
very handy tool will give you a a RAW
file and you can play with it

634
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:36,780
are you want afterwards are the third
tools probably the most interesting

635
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,590
though

636
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:41,700
and it's basically call PC hunter

637
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:45,390
AK and I'll the pronunciations way up

638
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:48,880
zeuner I called that because well it
hasn't

639
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,720
xtian are in it so when I was on a
response team

640
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:57,610
we're trying to find a lot of tools
basically that would

641
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:01,260
look deeper into the kernel are a lot
older only coated

642
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:05,190
were eighty x86 architecture so

643
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:08,640
when you're on a 64-bit machine you're
looking at

644
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,560
64-bit architecture there's somewhere
problems that come up

645
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,730
a lot of the tools that actually look at
the

646
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:18,880
MBR and stuff like that are made for x86

647
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,460
some you run them and the blue screen
window 7 64 bit

648
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:28,150
they're not made to run in 64-bit
environment is the problem

649
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:31,480
and you can just change that

650
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,050
change loan modification from the code
Aurora party says

651
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:38,360
it's a poor rewrite don't quote me on
that

652
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,520
don't know if it's true own up there
just sleazy admins by

653
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,900
it seems like a whole lotta work so I
was trying to find the stall

654
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,600
basically that would let me look

655
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,819
and see what the heck's going on colonel
while I was on a machine that was

656
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,100
actively running our

657
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:56,670
and like i've seen a lot of tools Mauer
will blacklist

658
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:59,910
PSS killer Process Explorer jeaner

659
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:02,910
if you're familiar with the matter all
these fools are so well-known

660
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:06,650
AB heard to sorry AB authors Mauer
authors

661
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:10,200
we're just gonna group I'm in the same
boat actually is they're both

662
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,810
a assholes so are so we were looking

663
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:18,460
on how do we prevent the smaller even
when the Mauer was

664
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:22,040
stopping our tools from running we knew
exactly how

665
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:26,320
at the call to make that saw but we just
couldn't get in because

666
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,880
x86 tools it wasn't meant for the
architecture

667
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:33,860
so another thing I'm going to talk about
is

668
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:37,180
basically our research told are finding
tools

669
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:41,530
are in don't take my word for by we're
gonna go through that as well

670
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:45,300
%uh so we found this PC 100 used to be
called just neuter

671
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:49,630
its available on zuber dot com slash
download

672
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:52,930
reason I've flash download is because
the entire website is

673
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:56,020
manger in being if you can remainder in
DRI

674
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:59,700
goes means late I'm they're probably
talking to a local said

675
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:04,260
I've no idea what they're talking about
but there's a dollar directory is just

676
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:08,240
an index directory can download there's
a free version there's a pro version

677
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,450
there's nothing cavers in whoever that
guy is order all the codes this

678
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:17,200
utility has gone against the wishes of
their people

679
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:21,600
being day a lot of chinese hackers group
hack into america

680
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:26,330
this is a tool that actually allows me
on a 64-bit architecture

681
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:30,390
lookin into the kernel I can look in a
ring 0 I can look in the ring

682
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:34,990
3 I'll I can look at all the cattle
calls not only that I

683
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:39,180
when I run this itself obfuscates
dropped its own driver

684
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:42,210
when it's done when you close it it
kills the driver

685
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:45,650
if you can see the the top I

686
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:48,820
there a blue bar up there every time you
run it

687
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:52,020
is a gives you different string so it's
not

688
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:56,090
identifiable to Mauer he s just killer
when you run it

689
00:42:56,090 --> 00:43:00,070
and you look at it in a situation like
this it it comes off as the same thing

690
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,640
every single

691
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,350
you know them our knows exactly what to
look for unblock it

692
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:07,750
with this utility which is an

693
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:12,000
really good English as a matter fact are
you can just look so deep they

694
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,510
we've been highly these listeners in red

695
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:18,710
and you can just right click and delete
them and run your tools all day

696
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:22,040
white say why

697
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:26,890
why I'm not going to like this on on
North American soil I have no idea

698
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:32,610
why is this this person code this when a
lot of people are trying to break in

699
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:36,330
to American you government facilities
and what not

700
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:39,480
well

701
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,430
so through at they are debugging their
own to

702
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:47,820
are some other stuff you can do you can
actually look and see if

703
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:51,040
ring 3 if the program that's running has
written three axis

704
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,480
as you'll see I by the manner in on the
screen

705
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,280
it this particular tillery says it's
denied

706
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:05,010
but it does have your rates injuring
three something else you can do

707
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:08,560
that I found very useful in a snap if
you're in a hurry with the shit this

708
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,090
utility it has a

709
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:14,350
computer examination have the you can
just run a full report

710
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:17,490
every single have I mean this thing is
really the

711
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:21,450
in the system with the the information
it spits out it takes a bit

712
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:26,120
if you're in a hurry you needed you know
generated image the machine you want as

713
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,480
much information as you can

714
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,900
reexamination port you'll be surprised
at the results

715
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,570
arthur's a ton of other stuff in this
utility it even has

716
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:38,400
went to run it you can actually disable
other excuse and services from starting

717
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:38,900
up

718
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:42,300
are as the lead functionally word
doesn't just early

719
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:47,800
you can kill bully are and delete unlock
you know I could put a file with the

720
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,800
same power name

721
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,360
in place the following just deleted so
it doesn't come back

722
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,470
or tries not come back I mean worker
this

723
00:44:55,470 --> 00:45:00,130
there's even a fire I add on
unfortunately which then they put out a

724
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,220
PT one report

725
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:05,680
on for so very very useful tool

726
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:12,200
white by

727
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:12,660
but

728
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:15,700
but look

729
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:19,450
exactly so all these tools agree

730
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:24,140
every single to lie fine I I analyze
like it's Mauer

731
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:27,299
like I put it in a ringer because I
wanna know exactly

732
00:45:27,299 --> 00:45:31,230
we're going to use this on tones machine
specially corporate network or know what

733
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:32,059
it does for

734
00:45:32,059 --> 00:45:35,180
you want all the survival shows nearly
you know

735
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:38,269
never buy a survival kit at the store

736
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:42,259
always make your own so you know exactly
what it does same philosophy applies to

737
00:45:42,259 --> 00:45:43,200
finding tools

738
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,569
the combat now we're ni situations in

739
00:45:46,569 --> 00:45:49,640
this fall does like

740
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:54,599
45 call-outs the China it's still a
killer tall

741
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:59,339
but guess what before I do anything I'm
gonna know all these eye peas on whose

742
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:00,970
by largely middle basse-bolle

743
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:05,269
does a I this last coming in this part
so when I actually asked me

744
00:46:05,269 --> 00:46:08,829
if I was monitoring the DNS requests
they were going now

745
00:46:08,829 --> 00:46:14,259
no I wasn't don't take my word for it
past the shuttle before use it

746
00:46:14,259 --> 00:46:17,759
but regardless its killer tall

747
00:46:17,759 --> 00:46:22,200
now since he's actually move this to

748
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:27,910
I PC 100 rather than calling is your
there is a pro version

749
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:31,269
the cost money apparently or yen or
whatever

750
00:46:31,269 --> 00:46:35,480
I there's a free version and this is the
free version only 10

751
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:38,789
what it does differently because I can
understand the website

752
00:46:38,789 --> 00:46:42,200
arm but it you know what

753
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:46,039
the free version in the paid version
both call about

754
00:46:46,039 --> 00:46:51,019
or five times to various eye peas in
China 10 them I'm assuming is legit

755
00:46:51,019 --> 00:46:52,039
update mechanism

756
00:46:52,039 --> 00:46:55,130
the other end I don't care like I don't
wanna know what they are

757
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:59,019
a little block him the killer to one of
the one you use it I mean

758
00:46:59,019 --> 00:47:02,960
the caveat that is also after you take
in the packet capture

759
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,109
all the PLO all the network cable
plugged that is

760
00:47:06,109 --> 00:47:09,109
you know don't wanna call use it as

761
00:47:09,109 --> 00:47:12,799
the portsmith be but always do research
on your tools

762
00:47:12,799 --> 00:47:17,119
Sysinternals I wanna nope it's called
back to my car saw

763
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:20,059
I wanna know if Microsoft is actually

764
00:47:20,059 --> 00:47:23,670
looking at hashes for every single thing
i'm looking at on our inspection

765
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:28,959
mean don't trust anything just because
Microsoft made it doesn't mean it's a

766
00:47:28,959 --> 00:47:29,689
legitimate

767
00:47:29,689 --> 00:47:35,059
in look at Windows money addition you
know is

768
00:47:35,059 --> 00:47:38,130
only me think the current system for all
they actually bought from someone

769
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:42,529
arm tedious task killer from Kaspersky
then make that the bar

770
00:47:42,529 --> 00:47:46,189
from RG murder I think it was a killer
routine utility but

771
00:47:46,189 --> 00:47:50,390
you know it the same thing goes for PSS
killer

772
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:54,539
it actually calls out the Kaspersky
every time you write it

773
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:59,039
wants to know if it's updated so it
called back to Kaspersky

774
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:02,779
every single time you run it and you'll
get this prompt that says pay

775
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:06,689
are looks like PSS cialis other day
let's go ahead and update it before you

776
00:48:06,689 --> 00:48:07,380
actually run

777
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:10,959
combat the smaller doesn't matter what
company you work for

778
00:48:10,959 --> 00:48:15,949
at work for another TV company it's not
Kaspersky you realize how much data they

779
00:48:15,949 --> 00:48:17,650
can be getting back just from

780
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:22,069
that update mechanism same with the one
on this only this is China

781
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:25,140
kasperski's Russia but arm

782
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:28,269
no same thing so if you're gonna find
dolls

783
00:48:28,269 --> 00:48:33,249
fine tolls but analyze 'em don't trust
them even that bump it program

784
00:48:33,249 --> 00:48:38,439
I went over to make an outgoing call
someone something like a temp file

785
00:48:38,439 --> 00:48:43,150
the other day they won't know what if I
was its

786
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:47,660
associate with Mauer mostly are but it's
actually a lossless compression

787
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:51,229
I format photographers use to use

788
00:48:51,229 --> 00:48:54,609
before well everyone starts but now with
tips

789
00:48:54,609 --> 00:48:58,809
I'm pretty sure but there are no you
know what is this such third book in the

790
00:48:58,809 --> 00:49:00,249
CP connected outbound

791
00:49:00,249 --> 00:49:04,089
anything no doesn't make any funny
registry keys no

792
00:49:04,089 --> 00:49:08,239
stuff like that every single thing
you're going to use

793
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:12,959
analyze it I there's a utility call sis
tracer I'm sure there's other utilities

794
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:16,979
says tracer basically takes registry
snapshot and then

795
00:49:16,979 --> 00:49:19,979
you install whatever you take another
entry snaps I

796
00:49:19,979 --> 00:49:23,619
you do different on he would happen if
you have an automated say about

797
00:49:23,619 --> 00:49:24,819
utilities setup

798
00:49:24,819 --> 00:49:27,910
kinda does anyways roll call everything
was created

799
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:31,979
and who has a shirt and i dont so

800
00:49:31,979 --> 00:49:33,210
other stuff you should check out

801
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:36,430
now because they're awesome multi

802
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:40,110
course are all tilly actually has a
utility that

803
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:43,650
can grab onto the active memory in the
system

804
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:48,680
and Lee drop ship directly of it while
it's running I can recall the actual

805
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:54,140
name that utility but checkup all Toledo
minutes for playing with the do memory

806
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:55,190
dump on your machine

807
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:58,660
figure out your own passwords other R
Kelly Willis

808
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:01,670
I'm not even ask you all use it

809
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:06,210
or something I'll Kelly is actually good
for this kind of thing you can swoop in

810
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:06,570
as

811
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:10,860
you can do like anything's the wood used
actually hack someone with Callie

812
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:14,730
the motor stuff like this so in the in
the case of Lake

813
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:18,020
on PC hunter you could actually set up a
fake

814
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:21,770
in a server in catches the US request
with you believe there are rebuilding

815
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:22,380
the telly

816
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:25,480
are witnesses internals check them out

817
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,790
its them hours I

818
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:32,890
remove all all walks really and I hate

819
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:36,140
I just causes and pearls for saw only
Windows

820
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:39,270
kinda painted a bit up

821
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:44,350
Jimmer humors me I it's only x86 with
the rootkit detection removal tool

822
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:47,800
humor will either be a rock star or it
will be a

823
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:52,560
the blue screen or machine so it doesn't
initial scan to see you start up

824
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:56,070
some time that's can hit the trip wire
in you know in May

825
00:50:56,070 --> 00:51:00,290
only script a walker on your machine so
were warning with love these

826
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:03,580
now we're cares if you're trying to
uninstall

827
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:06,720
Google obviously arm Wireshark

828
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:10,100
everyone in this room should at least
have some experience were short

829
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:14,180
anything download it because the logo is
a fuckin shark why would you not want

830
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:14,660
that

831
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:19,470
on so just some are some beautiful
utilities as well

832
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:24,110
I if anyone is familiar with kinda
forensic investigation

833
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:29,340
the utilities helix really going on lot
about forensic investigators

834
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:33,240
in the AM per second to use helix lonely
tools built in

835
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:37,500
while need imaging tools I deft is the
not so known

836
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:41,570
I was looking for an alternative to
helix art dept actually had actual

837
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:43,290
libraries built in that let me

838
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:45,780
mount the a Mac OS

839
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:50,440
in HFS plus image or something and
actually access it correctly as though

840
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,460
it were a Mac

841
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:56,310
rather than having to fiddle around in
basically do stupid stuff too

842
00:51:56,310 --> 00:52:00,110
to make it the files about another
reason I hate Macs

843
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:05,750
arm no offense to anyone but I should
just be able to mount the fuckin image

844
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:09,780
instead of jumping they're a bunch hoops
nonetheless if you need to Def

845
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:13,660
re: houses live reason such built-in
there's nothing you need to install

846
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:17,850
irons boot CD they were no barns with CD

847
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:22,660
year Hearns is freaking awesome its
prolly highly illegal

848
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:27,300
are the tolls like don't take are you
from there's a mini version of XP on it

849
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:30,420
you can literally who to at the W I am
file

850
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:33,600
XP inside Windows XP shell which is

851
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:37,160
useful from our removal arm I actually

852
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:40,360
modified hirings it it's about 500

853
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:43,470
make I so I got it down to about 119
makes

854
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:46,750
and I made a responder disc actually and

855
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:50,350
we were able to boot into Windows XP you
were over the moon links partition

856
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:51,000
Saidapet

857
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,530
an the XP side actually made networking

858
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:58,080
automatically start up our wireless and
wired and

859
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:01,880
the background image was like
instructions on how to run TeamViewer

860
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:05,060
teamwork line on their and

861
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:08,240
it just had a her removal tools home
instruction als

862
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:11,390
for anyone to actually remove viruses
with it

863
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:14,730
why do I make that wall for Bill Walker
arm

864
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:18,390
got sick at home people take the machine
the look like you

865
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:22,030
I T store IT department there was no way

866
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:25,280
back before trip to water actually
infected and

867
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,410
encrypting the entire hard drive it
would just

868
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:32,010
for a while they are all ransomware it
would throw up

869
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:35,790
the screen it would just make like
walking on your system maybe turn your

870
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:36,770
webcam on mister

871
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:42,369
yourself arm but then it got a little
smarter and started using like a yes to

872
00:53:42,369 --> 00:53:47,320
for the encryption on your files and it
became true ransomware

873
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:51,140
it wasn't just something you had to get
past to get access to explore selling

874
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:51,600
more

875
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,619
arm but irons very good has like

876
00:53:54,619 --> 00:53:59,150
hearted person norton ghost on just
crazy good utilities all over the

877
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:03,260
least and by default on the DOS menu
when you boot to it you can do seven

878
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:03,840
layer

879
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,870
I 0 the the FBI uses you

880
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:10,040
it remove anything the you may not want
on

881
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:13,780
and also %uh ship workstation is just
IBM

882
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:17,770
there are scenes offers for free
download it

883
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:21,520
you know pump it up on your a on your
hypervisor just check into it

884
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,690
it does about the same thing as he licks
only it's an actual

885
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:28,210
are workstation that you just download
the image for think it's looking over

886
00:54:28,210 --> 00:54:28,640
years

887
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:32,610
like a other things to check out like
honey drive if you've never heard of it

888
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:36,200
the drive is really useful thing if
you're used to run like I

889
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:39,520
like Knoppix and just anything you think

891
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:47,860
re-building honey drive in it download
VM don't link so you have to google

892
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:51,660
and at it

893
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:55,520
