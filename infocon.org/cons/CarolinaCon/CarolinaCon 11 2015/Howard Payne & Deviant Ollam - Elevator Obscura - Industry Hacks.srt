1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:04,940
alright alright

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:08,480
so make make covered it on the pen
tester

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,599
he's an elevator guy we met because this
industry

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,880
needs a little kick in the pants as far
security is concerned

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,199
and even though he is not here
representing Payne al Mare

6
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:21,140
we are here representing hacker
community and a bunch of anything

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,220
ingenuity and fun things york-new

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,400
me in a fun things that you can and
can't do which they try to do or not do

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,679
pretty much solution do anything but
I'll

10
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:34,280
our lawyers are required to mention that
a poor standards climbers apply

11
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,800
you're responsible for your own behavior
and we're telling you straight up most

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,110
of these things are either prohibited by
law or would put you at a

13
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,000
great degree of risk of physical harm or
%ah you could damage equipment which

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,420
would be financial harm cell

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,480
carefully consider your actions before
taking anything away from a stock

16
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,910
yet elevators in general are not gonna
kill you most of their trips go without

17
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:54,500
incident

18
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,920
most people every year the few that are
actually in her killer bass the by M

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,030
working on elevators but yet you all

20
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,030
like that mean howard said it would
really pay attention it's fun

21
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,510
de for our stuff right he say they're
they're very failure modes

22
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,729
yes elevators to behave in ways you
don't necessarily expect

23
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:15,490
as a result things like this can happen
so here we have a leg

24
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:19,159
in a gap between the cardinal and Excel
that's about one inch wide

25
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:24,320
yes how you I think you're smart enough
you might say look we're not we're not

26
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,850
completely it's not gonna die

27
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,790
we just wanna play reagan is very
accurate doesn't mean that you can't

28
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,720
cause major damage

29
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,750
you don't know what you're doing so just
because you think you're smart enough

30
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,010
not to kill yourself

31
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:39,680
doesn't mean a a thing like a felony
criminal mischief causing excess

32
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,540
thousand dol-

33
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:47,330
clear all seniors on you tonight

34
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,980
yeah

35
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:55,820
right and yes in this one the

36
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:01,060
in

37
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,590
charged right there

38
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:08,270
no whenever state this happen and it was
like over a thousand dollars worth of

39
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:08,940
damage

40
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,480
so and became a felony for this guy yeah
so

41
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,170
we're experts at this you're not please
believe us when we say

42
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:21,560
shouldn't try most sinister many in you
may have seen this all before or summers

43
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,610
on this awe

44
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,840
we keep updating and revising it how
many people are seeing the beginnings in

45
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,560
the on iraq in toppling and hope

46
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,150
or Def Con so a lot on you know some of
the basic

47
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,959
we're not going to get into every little
different on elevator system ever

48
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,510
understand that at least there are two
major varieties in elevator

49
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,060
as overhead traction and there's
hydraulic which is usually pushing from

50
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:43,650
below

51
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,290
but in each in those cases the elevator
itself

52
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:51,170
the box that you're standing in the room
that little traveling room

53
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:55,019
does not contain most like motor drive
power

54
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:58,180
the power source of motion is under way
up

55
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:02,310
in the penthouse all way down below in
the pit and the car you're in

56
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,290
mechanically

57
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,450
virtually all it has are things like
rollers on the side

58
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,630
just guided along the rails and the boys
play stabilize its trap

59
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,750
but the actual power source is somewhere
else

60
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,450
and you're just interacting with that
system through a series of fixtures

61
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,590
and Powell technology right so

62
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,470
there's a variety of pictures you can
interact with most the time it just

63
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,150
comes down

64
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,430
pushing buttons and its gonna give you
feedback in the form

65
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,489
eliminated indicators like you're seeing
here so

66
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:34,620
all those fixtures are tied back to

67
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,620
some type of component in the machine so

68
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,230
somewhere whether it's a hydraulic
elevator illusion is mint or whether

69
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,510
it's a traction elevator and

70
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,340
in the penthouse everything's going back
to the smaller room and the controller

71
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,590
what you're gonna see a second as

72
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,989
making the decision to drive those
motors this is a very boring working

73
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:54,420
motor room this is a hydraulic elevator
not a whole heck of a lot going on

74
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,459
we're seeing on the right is the
controller and that's actually driving

75
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:00,489
with that hydraulic pump units in the
middle and you could see the hydraulic

76
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:00,970
line

77
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,260
actually running up in a row

78
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,510
back and always like a the some buckets
and oil

79
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,620
shot will get it is a little later many
area

80
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,849
but everything you do to interact in
this elevator

81
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:14,939
from any the fixtures hallway at cetera

82
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:18,040
you're talking to this Howard this is
the controller right crack

83
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,010
now the controller unit I mean it's very
much

84
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,229
you know I can hackers and what's the
kernel man it's the brain

85
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:28,360
like this is this is that this is the
brains of the operation

86
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,580
it is in the motor room and it is doing
all the decision

87
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,030
the evolution of this comes primarily
from

88
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:38,800
relay logic controllers so we've been
talking about a lot different types and

89
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,520
elevators by

90
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,669
fundamentally the decision making
machine that is the controller

91
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:46,280
was traditionally just a series of
relays that were interconnected that

92
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,780
would pollen or drop out

93
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,729
depending on the state that the elevator
existed yeah whereas positionally who

94
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:52,940
wants what demand

95
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,539
center a and companies are still in use
the owner there's a lot of stuff like

96
00:04:56,539 --> 00:04:56,820
this

97
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,650
with this

98
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:05,830
this is not immune from in New York City
operating as you can stay

99
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,700
so the a typing Otis controller called

100
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,480
you AL and see that at delays are
dropping and picking out

101
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,110
other related dropping and picking out
and a little bit a lag

102
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,780
L all analog stuff you're seeing here

103
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:24,970
High Point collector it spins around at
the elevators moving up and down

104
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:25,720
horseplay

105
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,130
leader makes or breaks contact let the
elevator knows where it's located

106
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,570
so with your going to four when the
contact for four

107
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,930
comes in that on the elevator knew that
it was there because something was

108
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,810
making a physical contact between a
circuit and that was that again

109
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:44,620
some on the system's because it's
expensive to totally tear out but in a

110
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,300
new owner

111
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,600
so many systems are still running to
this day this was still running

112
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,790
loneliness like want to scare you

113
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:55,420
owners are very safe remember those
first few slides this safe because

114
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,270
there's not a lot

115
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,840
picking the wrong when logic this basic
right how many viruses

116
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,870
exist in line OS to rate not well

117
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:08,599
this actually was from an accident site
so in

118
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:10,349
the controller was not involved though
it was

119
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:15,770
something else when modeling so you saw
me in the smaller power we opened up the

120
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,270
modern control systems are all
microcontroller

121
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:21,909
but they're all doing the same job
they're all taking user input taking

122
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:25,120
data input from where the owner is
traditionally and

123
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,460
adding that up and saying well I need to
drive this motor to do you'll see PLC's

124
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,759
too but they're a lot less common

125
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:34,330
so what other input you like the most
the most

126
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,520
simple way besides a pie plates like
turkey that I was a little more

127
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,620
mechanically complex

128
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,300
the most simple way for an elevator
nowhere was was have roller switches

129
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:42,879
like this

130
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,120
that when the elevator arrived a little
pain when pushed us

131
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,930
ya spring-loaded switch and actually
make or break a contact that was wired

132
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:50,750
in horseplay

133
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,069
we're seeing here is not that this is
something called the limits which still

134
00:06:54,069 --> 00:06:55,490
exists on modern elevators

135
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,930
this is at the very top %uh Voice way
but also limits which is at the bottom

136
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,930
Voice way that's to indicate to the
owner its approaching

137
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:05,020
orange at the endowment actual possible
travel run

138
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,379
and if you get that lasts went right at
the top there

139
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:12,110
that's the I'm fucked signal and that
means that you absolutely need no nigga

140
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:12,699
gotta come out

141
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:17,770
exit that cap so yes slow down when it
wants one on one floor down to theirs to

142
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,639
slowdowns

143
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,479
third one's a normal limit me pushed and
when that elevator is level with the top

144
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,229
floor

145
00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:26,240
and the final which means there's
nowhere else what I can to go

146
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,199
yeah but beyond that be on the top and
the bottom you have this in the middle

147
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:30,900
%uh voice to a

148
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,199
running through the Voice way the
magnetic field right write this one

149
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,620
uses a magnetic what magnetic strips
that are placed on that tape

150
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,770
a black tape that runs up and down in
the picture next to their

151
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:45,219
guide rails that as a selector the
selector is picking up that magnetic and

152
00:07:45,219 --> 00:07:46,460
by with a little reed switch

153
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,990
and as girl down I can tell again where
it's located

154
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,719
the advantage to this of course is that
since it's not an actual physical system

155
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:54,849
that's moving back and forth

156
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:59,000
this is a lot less prone to fail rikers
mechanical switch on break after

157
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,780
you know 100000

158
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,950
repetitions whatever so these are a lot
less likely to fail in that mode

159
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,840
they can fill in other ways yes talk
about and the elevator cab should know

160
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,470
and the controller should know where the
cat is traveling

161
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:14,490
any given time not just am I had a floor
but even in between floors

162
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:18,590
a faster I'm going what's the travel
like the owner should know what it's

163
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,950
doing at all times

164
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:23,280
and that's how I can tell whether to
stop the motor slow the modern down

165
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,420
whether real Eveleth here in on a really
crappy hydro the

166
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,000
you ever been an elevator the kinda like
stop and the following a little tiny

167
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,130
extra-large like that

168
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,180
reliable yeah writings was drifting off
the floor level

169
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,410
or the load changes yeah it's not
loading 20 people in elevator could you

170
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:39,580
wanna wait for the next one

171
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,800
and I kinda like to that number re level
yeah the selector

172
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,010
around the world moving here what if
something goes really really wrong

173
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:50,150
right elevators have safeties

174
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:54,700
elevators for the longest time had very
interesting mechanisms and prevented you

175
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,390
from die

176
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,970
many people they know if your history
buff the name

177
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,120
especially in this country but a big
name in all matters is what's what's the

178
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,360
deal anything

179
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,840
mister who Otis always did not invent
the elevator right

180
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:13,460
honest in what to the elevator email
ASAP made breaks he made mechanism did

181
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,680
make it to make brakes

182
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,150
except I never thought I'd right he made
a safe mechanism that would merely

183
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,600
survive severing

184
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,750
I'll the roping system so here we see
modern

185
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,810
governors and we see other safeties on
than working up direction travel

186
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:32,300
and prevent overspeed but the original
oh yes rail gripper safety

187
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,540
was designed so that if there's positive
pressure if there's tension on the rope

188
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,420
in came a voice

189
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,490
cable the safeties doing nothing just
kinda top 10

190
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:45,140
but if that cable go slack for example
if the entire rope system breaks in the

191
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:45,580
winch

192
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:49,850
fails or knows what that mechanism under
spring pressure will fire out

193
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:54,170
in ripped the rails and this is a
gentleman actually clearly very much on

194
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,230
british television

195
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,750
not saying that just because his teeth
but because he's being raised in way

196
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,910
higher than you and let someone do a TV
host

197
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:05,340
in america and just having a workman
come on up insightful I'm

198
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,350
is like I was gonna work right and then
sure enough

199
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:14,550
catch up and that historically what
mister onus would do with the strange

200
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,120
fares in world affairs he would host
himself up cut the rope

201
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,270
and everyone was screaming at me his and
also a everyone it says I'm scott knows

202
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,140
history in engineering stuff like this
right

203
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,790
yes so this is what has involved into
modern

204
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,410
elevator braking systems and rogue river
systems and railed rivers

205
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:34,620
the idea of a governor roping setup

206
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,530
a series one we same wrote in the
industry you know we're not talking like

207
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,480
camp systems

208
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,500
they used to be yesterday at like that
some yet what modern cables or anything

209
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,360
ropes there's

210
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,030
extra roping going on in the host way
traveling with the car

211
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:50,970
and if for any reason the car over
speeds

212
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:54,810
the governor's the extra the Gunners
will trip and yank on that rope

213
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:59,070
jamming into the break mechanisms which
will just snowshoes in the Rio Grande

214
00:10:59,070 --> 00:10:59,930
rift the rail

215
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:03,430
yeah bring the car to a stop exactly so
it's actually

216
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:07,680
really hard to die in an elevator if
you're not using it like Jack Black

217
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,660
like if you're just in the cab the
safest place to be is in the cabin is

218
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,240
the cab is not knowing to plummet

219
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,360
free fall and even if something
completely went wrong

220
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,550
and like you know literally the governor
wrote here the governor thing grabs your

221
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,550
just going down

222
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:28,110
there are bars in the pit the pit is
designed to accept the full weight and

223
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:28,770
the elevator

224
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:33,350
for normal travel speed right correct
engine crashing that buffer answer I'm

225
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,750
not even damage the elevator and you
might get a little

226
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:40,490
my twist an ankle but the elevator is
going to try to keep you alive

227
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:43,770
and the systems have evolved over the
years in a lot of ways

228
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:47,290
to make you be safe every day elevators
wanting to live

229
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,510
and we want you to live

230
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:53,770
with that said another disc player yeah
well the disclaimer that's they want to

231
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:54,460
live here

232
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,970
in the cash right now we're not like

233
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:01,720
update and go for it. and there's like a
lot of history in agriculture with

234
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,360
elevators and things you shouldn't do

235
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,860
like you don't want to be these kids
right you don't want to

236
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,170
seriously me laugh it has meant to me
act

237
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:16,810
that an actual surveillance footage 311
don't think around

238
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:20,390
like I

239
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:24,410
landmark attacker there's a light on top

240
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:31,410
car

241
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:36,750
almost her entire life

242
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:43,750
so sure enough you know riding on an
elevator call hi

243
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:50,970
you know the you don't want that failure
mode

244
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,709
and that's why we let that happen

245
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:57,860
yeah people have been killed in a car a
its

246
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,220
it don't fuck around the house when
people were telling you this for a

247
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,410
reason I mean it's not gonna hit by the
counterweight is obviously Paul hazards

248
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,139
electrocution hazard is a million as

249
00:13:05,139 --> 00:13:08,790
so that's why we need to get a minute
that we're not responsible for you being

250
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,110
stupid you think video immediately

251
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:18,110
later so I was to continue so that being
said he said

252
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:22,420
automatic mode the elevator wanting to
stay alive will keep you alive

253
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,999
there are a lot of special modes of
operation though and we would love to

254
00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:28,540
share something with you if you're
interested are you interested

255
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,990
alright bang right off the bat

256
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:36,869
how many people you can test work in
your pen tester like me and like many of

257
00:13:36,869 --> 00:13:37,339
us

258
00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:40,730
you will probably play with independent
service Mon if you ever tinker with an

259
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:41,300
elevator

260
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:45,819
there are key switches or even just flip
switches behind lock panels

261
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:49,749
independent service mode is far away
when the most useful things you can do

262
00:13:49,749 --> 00:13:50,610
in an elevator

263
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:54,589
if you want to do things is not supposed
to do looking to independent

264
00:13:54,589 --> 00:13:59,279
will take the elevator out in the group
bank and Omega your private elevator

265
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,209
now in many building apart Minister no
use independent if they have to move

266
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,040
somebody and

267
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,119
and they don't want that on their going
away any news for other demand

268
00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:11,499
but if you're a pen tester everything
including like go to the other floors on

269
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:13,179
a supposed to go to that will work

270
00:14:13,179 --> 00:14:16,519
don't open the doors like that word the
other matter what service

271
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:20,649
Hall call I've hidden in elevators for
hours in a building

272
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:21,580
just sittin there

273
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:25,370
air wait for wanna go home cuz I snuck
in flipped independent

274
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:29,450
waited forever like I'm rollin share in
there and on my phone and a little GFCI

275
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,030
outlet

276
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:33,610
and in the end the day island drive down
to lobby let the team in

277
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:37,630
and i driving up to the top floor that
restricted let everyone out independent

278
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,120
mode

279
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,150
is super super user time really like
it's been good shit man

280
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:47,690
most of the time it on there are ways to
configure elevators for independent

281
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,280
service won't overwrite security

282
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,740
mmm but ninety percent of the time is
going to

283
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,940
yes and that's kinda outgrowth an older
style service right

284
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,320
right so back in the day historically
there used to be in attendance

285
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,300
I was actually doing the job on the
controller and have really logic a

286
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,080
certain point it was just a single speed
AC motor

287
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,730
DC motor whatever you know they have a
crank just like this and they can go up

288
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,240
or down at once P

289
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,610
innovation back then was we have two
speeds alright

290
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:19,120
what they would do is they were just you
decide okay I have passengers waiting in

291
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,150
the lobby I'll be right back for you
that go drop of people come back

292
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:26,920
know pick them up so attended known as
sort of an offshoot of that on automatic

293
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,530
controller

294
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:31,730
when you can actually do as have the car
still picking up people in the direction

295
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:32,220
of travel

296
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,540
dropping people off in the direction
they're traveling way to skip stops at

297
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,230
the bypass

298
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,610
by at a certain point the attendant to
make a decision

299
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:43,860
I need to reverse direction I need to go
the other way for some reason asahara's

300
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,590
full I can't take anyone else right yet
outside its it's a sort of

301
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,760
semi-automatic

302
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,850
attended no the owners still making the
leveling

303
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:55,150
it still opening the doors it still
doing the safety stuff

304
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:58,320
but the attendant is controlling the
actual dispatching

305
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,180
the car now what if you want to give
people in your building the ability

306
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:06,070
to be prioritized like an attendant
would you wanna pay for intent

307
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:09,940
they have that too they have like
express an executive service right

308
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,970
right so these are usually very into the
exact same thing which is that some

309
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:17,600
dim priority over other demand so in the
case on

310
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,960
express our Executive Service what that
means is that it either gonna

311
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,730
bring a car that's kinda in the same
direction you know whatever's next

312
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:25,070
you know

313
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,970
gonna stop anyway its gonna stop there
and it's gonna pick somebody important

314
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:28,400
up

315
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,610
and service their two-man support
services on demand VIP

316
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:36,500
executive priority service is actually
that it will reverse the direction

317
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,030
I'm the closest car regardless of what I
was doing and then tell everybody in the

318
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,840
car you don't get the hell out the CEO's

319
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:46,620
it's literally a voice announcement its
up it's like food this car is needed for

320
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,460
other services

321
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,490
please exit at the next lending like up
at

322
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:54,830
this on this release also to a hospital
emergency known something I you probably

323
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:57,140
also seen code blue people call it what
you're gonna cover

324
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:01,160
these are very closely related I
wonderful and the second now

325
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:08,160
yes question magnet

326
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:14,640
I think about clothes she said online at
me in automatically cancel he pushed the

327
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,350
wrong for

328
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,980
Logitech does this okay you can't cancel

329
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,020
a call from the cap by pressing a second
time the reason I think most controller

330
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,539
manufacturers don't do that is because
we're Americans

331
00:17:25,539 --> 00:17:29,700
we would trample each other to get to
our destination a second faster

332
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,940
and therefore people would get in the
cabinets can switch others calls to get

333
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,559
where they're going

334
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:36,730
at my hypothesis style yeah

335
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:42,620
suspending a people who think they're
more important than other people

336
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:47,500
for there's like sadness Mon if you
think that like the most important now

337
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,260
that Sabbath like that Sabbath mode

338
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,409
if you saw like bill are still yeah
people who think that because the words

339
00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:56,190
on high they're not allowed to do
certain things on religious days

340
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:00,240
Sabbath mode is a mode that lets you use
an elevator

341
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,130
without touching any but and how to do
this while the elevator will go to the

342
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,020
top floor

343
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:09,210
a building and then platform at every
floor on the way down

344
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:13,039
opening its doors letting you like mosey
on aw

345
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,750
I'm really tall building they do every
other floor but the idea is

346
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:20,070
in make people think that they're not
actually suppressing any switches are

347
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,659
tripping any

348
00:18:20,659 --> 00:18:24,190
your street only tripping all every
logic fat

349
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:27,539
if you're observant I apologize for
breaking the bad news you've probably

350
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:28,350
been lied to

351
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:32,710
out there are several several circuits
involved that you're interrupting

352
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:36,619
you ok the flow of current and and it
might just be ignored the input might be

353
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:37,679
ignored by the Comptroller

354
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,139
when you break that beam on the scanner
edge on the door you're still reckon

355
00:18:41,139 --> 00:18:43,299
I've been a minute still sees you there
and you're still

356
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:46,359
you know great fire alone in the car you
get on

357
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:49,940
elevator have to be to work harder work
last because you my understanding is

358
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,489
that as a

359
00:18:50,489 --> 00:18:53,859
very much prohibited by the same rule
that led to this

360
00:18:53,859 --> 00:18:58,749
cell this is later this is literally
devotion now what's interesting though

361
00:18:58,749 --> 00:19:01,519
is this is the first example we're gonna
given this talk

362
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:05,429
unlike hacks for the industry folk at me
so this wasn't

363
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:09,669
initially like program in the elevator
Lodge there are situations

364
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:13,279
where people made their own special
relays and then

365
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,869
on the weekends they would have you know
some Graham come up there me like I can

366
00:19:16,869 --> 00:19:18,109
flip the switch poem

367
00:19:18,109 --> 00:19:22,409
and like turn on elevator service for
like turn on shut Sabbath mode

368
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:26,429
and different logic would apply and
these are impacting the industry

369
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:29,710
intentionally got program then when more
and more

370
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:36,710
like elevators went up and younger than
that yes yeah

371
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,390
yes when it shut it down I so

372
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:48,000
this %uh this idea though I'll crafting
your own roll your own system

373
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,110
there's a lot of this in the industry
and you're going to see more examples

374
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:55,610
are really smart things are really dumb
things the people in the industry and

375
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:56,799
done just to make

376
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,480
something work a different way and I
find it fascinating something I really

377
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,179
really wish they would make it work
better than they do there is something

378
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:06,660
called load bypass

379
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,320
how many people have been in a crowded
elevator and you're like wise is

380
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,799
stopping all these floors can't pick up
calls

381
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,240
when there's no room left in the
elevator I wish I'm just going along 21

382
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,419
yeah itself as an axe yeah

383
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,720
well how many people have been an
elevator that beeps when it's too heavy

384
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,900
you put in EPS the elevator cassese

385
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,710
how much weight isn't it most the time
so the systems are programmed to be able

386
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:31,470
to say

387
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:36,500
how much loaded in this car idler alarm
you can configure that in the logic

388
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,830
to say from this elevators at ninety
percent of its load capacity

389
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:45,110
it's on floor 17 and trying to make its
way down I'm not gonna keep collecting

390
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,970
all this down demand right now

391
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:50,539
I'm just gonna go to a lot why this is
an enable more

392
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:54,120
hire more people like him in your
building well and a program the ship

393
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,470
it's always option on and that's not a
standard feature almost all matters but

394
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:02,049
but it's a useful feature yeah but that
license key

395
00:21:02,049 --> 00:21:05,900
yeah third on of I about this

396
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,929
in that I don't know I don't believe so

397
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:13,250
ever there are so many different methods
and doing it you know there there's just

398
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,539
a lot of different products unit there
was a pattern that one particular

399
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:16,260
product

400
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:20,669
it's been done how many people have seen
it is an elevator press all the buttons

401
00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:25,330
elevators can tell when somebody is
fucking around with your thing you press

402
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:25,780
all

403
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,520
you

404
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,120
I elevators him tell him something wrong
or

405
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,180
like there's not enough bus in this
there's not a lot of consumed us can

406
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,080
arrange is in play

407
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,660
as amazing keyboard very but we keep
hitting a button the owners like hell

408
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:43,780
don't tell me on 23 and boom out ok

409
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:48,390
it's like they know we're here yep

410
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:52,760
yeah ball only drop some of them was so
that's like that a light load is going

411
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,440
to get our

412
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,210
you got like you are 2.18 no reason is
99

413
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:02,110
morning article right now and

414
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:08,380
now we are going to hear alright 30 new
one for every dimension and hope or duck

415
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,200
on a a correction run

416
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,340
is the mod the elevator will go into
want it encoder and selector input start

417
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:14,910
to differ

418
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,940
so when the motor say and I went you
know X number

419
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:22,080
be and the selectors and La Tengo that
many the elevator might

420
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,240
run itself what's called a correction so
instead I'm running out contracts Peter

421
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,520
high speed will call

422
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,200
it'll run at inspection speed which is
usually like a 10 on this original speed

423
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:31,710
or less

424
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:34,950
and it'll go until it hits one does
limit switches are talking about

425
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:38,370
and reverse direction and I'm going to
the other limits which and the whole

426
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:41,230
time if looking at the encoder implants
and learning

427
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:45,610
ways to again it's a okay I've got ten
floors and this is how far apart they

428
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:45,970
are

429
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:49,820
so when I get lost it might be a
situation like this where

430
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:53,260
you might be very well in the cabin this
happen you maybe 11 is going on in this

431
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,230
elevator

432
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:58,740
I it would not be honored on if you are
and and this happens chances are the

433
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,030
floor indicator or go out

434
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:02,950
you'll feel that you're going up it'll
eventually stopped or reversed direction

435
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:05,150
you feel you're going eventually stop

436
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:09,059
and open its doors and let you out so
that ever happens now

437
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:12,290
yeah I said that's not a lot to me
nothing. Wednesday yes

438
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:17,880
the consequences are getting out of sync
it can create

439
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,620
fault in the controller the car can shut
itself down a contract passengers

440
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,980
but for the most part it's not really a
safety issue so much as it is

441
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:29,429
and passengers comfort issue tram or
some had a medical problem

442
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:32,429
trap yeah you don't wanna miss level you
don't wanna like

443
00:23:32,429 --> 00:23:36,380
huge in the worst case could possibly be
in when driving me right the selector

444
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,010
says I am going close and was like

445
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:41,580
I am turn up our you know you don't
wanna be a thing for that reason

446
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:48,580
yes the optical under

447
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:54,420
al I got through I it should because the
diff whatever you know

448
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:57,870
again whatever differently would be
should be you know insignificant the the

449
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,429
tape itself is gonna be thick

450
00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:05,309
not part of the actual voice text
they're they're out there sometimes it

451
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:09,350
yeah I like the actual traction shiplap
motor but as far as changing

452
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,800
you know again the rope stretches all
that you're saying we're not alone

453
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,550
that's true at all

454
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:16,650
but we're talking about when their way
out think dowd

455
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:23,650
yes it back

456
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:29,480
oh yeah and they said they have the man
in the overload and that was the nylon

457
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,250
box up here

458
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:33,500
so yeah there are various ways that's
just one there's others that just

459
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,529
measure the rope tension

460
00:24:34,529 --> 00:24:37,529
yeah racier a lot of times what it is is
that when the row comes down

461
00:24:37,529 --> 00:24:41,009
attached to the cars cross at it's
actually you note the rotors

462
00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:44,039
is straight up and down a picture that
and there'll be you know

463
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:47,279
from the coming in like that right to
from one side one in the middle and I

464
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,059
the robe stretches its gonna change that

465
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:56,059
no whatever distance it is very slightly
so that's that's the most common method

466
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:10,880
yeah it's usually inner voice announce
earnings here

467
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,610
right mode load bypasses when it's like
of 75 percent for liking it hell out

468
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:19,880
here

469
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,909
but your you're also asking about it
overload in the back

470
00:25:23,909 --> 00:25:28,899
so another mode that we haven't talked
about before now that I just think is

471
00:25:28,899 --> 00:25:32,260
adorable in Japan someone mentioned for
detecting the buttons

472
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:36,870
japan has pet Mon and when we were
trying to figure this out online Nissan

473
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,289
owner panel with his buttons

474
00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:41,710
unit as pets and we're like what is this
and can we know is like

475
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:45,570
I think that should be awesome and dogs
can run the elevator and turned on its

476
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:46,309
not it

477
00:25:46,309 --> 00:25:50,860
what it is is if your gas then you have
your puppy with you impressed Patnode

478
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:55,389
and lights go on in the hall stations so
that if anyone is like scared of dogs

479
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:57,710
like are such pet so afraid

480
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:01,260
they like more the they won't get

481
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,799
on the cab or something or the long run
away I don't know what happened in Japan

482
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,240
but you don't think that I would support
this in america just cuz I like to play

483
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,190
with puppies but

484
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:16,080
lol so that I can obscure one yes I
would get on the elevator in like making

485
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,980
back into the dogs they went up some
things we did this to us right now this

486
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:20,539
isn't

487
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:23,659
II honestly don't know where this is
from I'm guessing is from a parking

488
00:26:23,659 --> 00:26:24,860
garage pan out but

489
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:28,370
zigzag type shape but I it's not
uncommon to see

490
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:31,769
on implementation like this this is a
Dover by the way

491
00:26:31,769 --> 00:26:36,980
we're gonna get her impulse right Dover
pictures were gonna get into that by Tom

492
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:40,440
yes yeah I just like they made a batch
for the floors this is happening to me

493
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,200
at the factory has this badge

494
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,419
is great really

495
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:48,040
because the floor the tiny for the
children

496
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,940
a

497
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,299
art one other thing that many people
wish

498
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:57,859
elevator had is peak performance in peak
optimization

499
00:26:57,859 --> 00:27:01,779
during the morning and especially around
checking time in a hotel

500
00:27:01,779 --> 00:27:05,549
our people mostly trying to go on Sunday
morning you can check out

501
00:27:05,549 --> 00:27:08,739
right you're trying to know which way up
to your room or down in lobby

502
00:27:08,739 --> 00:27:11,950
what about two and three in the
afternoon when you can finally check

503
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,499
into hotel we try to go

504
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:17,080
I want to go up the elevators can be
configured

505
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,119
for peak performance where they park and
running idle

506
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:24,529
waiting for the next call many in the
morning a lot of the cab parked

507
00:27:24,529 --> 00:27:25,849
themselves on the top floor

508
00:27:25,849 --> 00:27:29,940
you can expect people to be coming down
all this can be optimized if you have a

509
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,059
competent tak

510
00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:34,269
programming the controller and can get
people around the building

511
00:27:34,269 --> 00:27:38,119
faster if you have a building please if
you're building owners are in this room

512
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:41,749
you a building that you like and want
benches about the elevator hire someone

513
00:27:41,749 --> 00:27:42,859
who knows what they're doing

514
00:27:42,859 --> 00:27:47,429
you can make it a lot freakin better me
two seconds the punch innocent our

515
00:27:47,429 --> 00:27:51,000
we can figure it all out

516
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,460
yeah we're gonna try to pick it up a
little bit I think mine

517
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,600
sim tower was originally an elevator
anywhere like an actual

518
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,980
technical similar it was meant to be a
performance access got their hands on it

519
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,379
said

520
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:05,529
you know shits a disaster in

521
00:28:05,529 --> 00:28:09,349
speaking of disasters there is seismic
motor earthquake mode

522
00:28:09,349 --> 00:28:13,079
that is exit that exists in certain
elevators they will trip

523
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:16,319
if the elevator gets in trouble if they
can actually feel the building shaking

524
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:20,029
and where he taught me is sometimes an
elevator in seismic alert will bill

525
00:28:20,029 --> 00:28:23,209
up and not now why would that be when

526
00:28:23,209 --> 00:28:26,969
building star chick there's the risk at
the counter where the cab

527
00:28:26,969 --> 00:28:30,229
actually free from the rail shake
officially

528
00:28:30,229 --> 00:28:33,969
hard at the counter weight becomes free
and the motor starts driving you toward

529
00:28:33,969 --> 00:28:34,569
the sewing

530
00:28:34,569 --> 00:28:38,779
our way lost a wrecking ball supporting
our down you know whatever right now our

531
00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:43,749
swinging around the crashes in the car
got a pretty serious problem so it is

532
00:28:43,749 --> 00:28:44,749
possible if you're

533
00:28:44,749 --> 00:28:48,759
situation where you're in an elevator
during our very well take you up

534
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:52,289
which is totally counter-intuitive just
get help yeah

535
00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:55,639
other times elevators my girl up is

536
00:28:55,639 --> 00:28:59,699
is not signed the contract for you and
say civil unrest right now cell

537
00:28:59,699 --> 00:29:03,589
right road basically just takes ground
connected levels

538
00:29:03,589 --> 00:29:07,929
how to play so you know if somebody is
your ransacking the billing and I threw

539
00:29:07,929 --> 00:29:09,089
a brick through the glass

540
00:29:09,089 --> 00:29:13,859
able access lobby not only will call the
elevator II the building's occupants can

541
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:14,829
still use the old

542
00:29:14,829 --> 00:29:18,769
around internally now the one place that
I actually saw this was a

543
00:29:18,769 --> 00:29:22,749
memories they want to be able to move
around and they didn't want you know

544
00:29:22,749 --> 00:29:24,059
something happening get through

545
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:26,969
they want to make sure that area was not
accessible but the other ones are still

546
00:29:26,969 --> 00:29:27,599
usable

547
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,279
it's a pretty night like the these are
all things that didn't exist

548
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:35,189
long ago but some customers said my what
can we do this

549
00:29:35,189 --> 00:29:38,239
and people in the industry alike I guess
we could

550
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:41,709
but program that shit in just like home
little

551
00:29:41,709 --> 00:29:46,529
hospital priority service the idea of a
doctor who's got a patient that has to

552
00:29:46,529 --> 00:29:50,029
go somewhere right away oh my god flip
that he is like super

553
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:54,639
absolute priority not even executive in
VIP know and I think it'll platinum

554
00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:55,199
level

555
00:29:55,199 --> 00:29:58,509
and then come back this will literally
take none nearest car

556
00:29:58,509 --> 00:30:03,389
immediately switches direction and run
at rated speed right back to the floor

557
00:30:03,389 --> 00:30:07,329
while making that announcement that says
elevator need please get out immediately

558
00:30:07,329 --> 00:30:10,369
and then I think you can sit there with
the doors open until the person with the

559
00:30:10,369 --> 00:30:10,919
key

560
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:12,070
rate it drives it

561
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:16,070
gives you a super user type mode because
you mean that all many innovations

562
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:19,470
some actions between that Executive
Service like you're talking about

563
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:22,870
automatic manual door control code
control

564
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:26,980
executive well you don't need to have
executives with the time

565
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:31,980
yet so also hospitals Code Blue is also
Code Pink

566
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:37,160
Code Pink is baby theft motor if you're
not familiar with security in hospitals

567
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,280
elevators can do what's called a type of
security recall

568
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:44,450
where if somebody move the child and
they're not authorized to move that baby

569
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:47,910
doors will lock around the hospital and
pager goes up when even elevators

570
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:51,590
you get stuck in an elevator or not take
you to the security in

571
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:55,580
like level and sit there and cyclin
doors worth keeping or shot like a man

572
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,030
trapped

573
00:30:56,030 --> 00:31:00,100
so elevators have been leveraged into a
lot of interesting security

574
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,060
architectures

575
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:05,080
in many many ways and over the years
people have come to depend on the thing

576
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:09,040
is we've gotten rid of a lot of security
staff is well no I mean the elemental

577
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,370
handle that nobody could do that nobody
can get that

578
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:16,640
more but olana this kid's undermined
with the one feature that is super

579
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,530
universal

580
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:20,630
in almost every element fire

581
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:24,750
operation yes fire servicemen since 1973
element

582
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:27,780
the 1973 code owners and required have
some

583
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:31,860
form firefighters emergency operation
back in seventy three it was just recall

584
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,890
that's when the smoke detectors heat
detectors went off somewhere near the

585
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:35,450
elevator

586
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:39,460
take the elevator out of service and
bring down a lot occupant

587
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:43,180
this came out back the button is used to
melt on the floor was on fire

588
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:47,500
contact get shorted and the elevator one
stop it if lawyers on fire with people

589
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:47,960
inside

590
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:52,720
years on the towering inferno yeah Riani
yet but it happened several times it

591
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,590
happened Chicago not too long ago on
elevator that wasn't even matter

592
00:31:55,590 --> 00:32:00,200
let they started doing after recall said
well what if we need to use the elevator

593
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:00,940
during fire

594
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:04,290
many and call phase 2 that the actual
true

595
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:07,690
firefighters emergency operation a
firefighter come to the building

596
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:10,910
get the key turns in the lobby it's in
the car

597
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:13,930
turns the key in the car and then rides
it wherever the fire

598
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:14,700
usually not

599
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:19,660
fire is usually 24 where the fire you
know depending on Yarmouth all

600
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:24,050
but yeah most important part
firefighters operation you need to know

601
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,410
is far security concerns

602
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:28,910
that all your security concerns go out
the window during an emergency

603
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:33,620
in the car actually said firefighters
emergency operation must override any

604
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,190
lockout

605
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:38,100
you put on on 0 sorry if you put you
know

606
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,330
investment in your elder security that
completely busted

607
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:44,890
the

608
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:48,120
not be mad yes from up to other

609
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,190
for %ah

610
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:56,260
the question is do they have one key %uh
you will get to that in all section on

611
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:56,610
that

612
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:59,800
yeah in a specific building a building
may only use one key

613
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,340
no matter how many old yeah yeah

614
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:07,310
any given building love one key some
states have adopted

615
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:11,050
their own key that's universal here to
stay one state at least

616
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:15,940
forced a super old key to be retrofitted
everywhere we had a whole section on the

617
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,790
keys about elevators and shit bio yet

618
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:21,650
there's a lot of interesting things
relating to elevators and fires

619
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:25,220
so I mean I found this little key switch
up in Montana State House

620
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:28,860
I'm like once I like using a toggle
switch what the heck is this thing

621
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:32,310
it looks like it's related to the fire
can I touch it probably not

622
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:35,340
I'm glad I did because this is the smoke
guard system

623
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:38,740
in an elevator system like a host way is
basically a giant chimney

624
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:42,760
and smoke and fire condition can spread
throughout a building very rapidly

625
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:47,040
but smoke garden systems like it will
cut will drop a shielded from the west

626
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,650
wing doors

627
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,690
to prevent smoking hot air from
traveling around the building

628
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:54,500
when you don't want to add a disaster
this little unusual to get most

629
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,250
modern elevators that are concerned with
this well as have movers in a damper

630
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:01,570
the top his way so it'll either open or
close depending on you know whatever the

631
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:02,090
fire

632
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:07,170
suppression system decide this is a this
I had an accident

633
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:11,960
when you have situations where like ask
us during the Q&A are asked to the bar

634
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,590
later

635
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:16,350
there might be situations where you seen
these are two different leaders in the

636
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:16,980
same building

637
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:20,360
this is a regular past year later at a
service elevator now

638
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:24,650
one other happens to have all your
traditional fire key including this red

639
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:25,490
halo around

640
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:29,600
the fire service which this one over
here does not appear to have that right

641
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:34,159
but if you look off to the side it was a
retrofit it was a secondary mod

642
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:38,730
so you'll see as code changes and Howard
can walk in the elevator simulate all

643
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:39,800
the switches here that's the

644
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,900
looking at the running on 83 code and
they did that the nineteen they've

645
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,720
adopted the ninety-six code in this
building

646
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:49,310
so there's a lot of differences in code
based on what you're going to see

647
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:52,420
how the elevator might behave but
they're all supposed to be following

648
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:55,800
these rules which is why we were really
surprised

649
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,820
when we saw elevator really close to
where we are right

650
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:02,850
this yeah this is I it's so weird
identical to the ones are here

651
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:06,300
but this is OK

652
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,080
myself that the pool elevator okay and
for some reason

653
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,730
they don't actually have fire service
keeps watch right

654
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:16,990
when it came down to is that it must
have been don't like to

655
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:20,870
eighty pretty much 83 code semi-solid
that

656
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:24,520
they've basically implemented so that
there's only one elevator in the bank

657
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,860
okay if there's a fire its gonna go on
emergency recall

658
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:31,610
that's the jewel fire service jewel to
light up to head buildings on fire

659
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:34,810
back walk call cancel issues on pace to

660
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:38,730
how do you get the phase 2 the key
switch in law so on like a modern

661
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:41,080
elevator where they have turned to case
which is when they get here

662
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,390
for some reason set it up so well turn
the key in the lobby

663
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:47,560
are crawling

664
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,580
yeah leader if Hewitt elevator obscure
there's some real obscure shit in this

665
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,490
industry man

666
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:58,040
by the way who could possibly have more
control over an elevator that a fire

667
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,850
responder

668
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:04,090
who is more important to an elevator the
fire personnel other personnel

669
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:08,140
right exactly the most powerful own in
pretty much any system

670
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:11,850
is hoist way inspection is getting if
you are in the house where you are gone

671
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:12,340
at that point

672
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:15,600
inspection overrides fire service but
there's a pretty sensible reason for

673
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,500
that when you think about it

674
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,320
there's a guy in cart opt for moving the
car unexpectedly working on something

675
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,980
you can create a serious problem not
just you know for the fact

676
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:27,499
yeah

677
00:36:27,499 --> 00:36:29,779
so yes a basic and the other of you
nothing

678
00:36:29,779 --> 00:36:33,349
to it I was on a cart often there's a
little indicator like to say hey the car

679
00:36:33,349 --> 00:36:35,239
wants to be on fire service but it's not

680
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:39,079
I'm getting the hell outta I'll be the
first 1i yell

681
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:42,339
so in just in general though the hoist
way is a

682
00:36:42,339 --> 00:36:45,690
not safe place to me if you do not know
what you're doing there are a lot of

683
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:48,739
controls in the hoist waning don't know
what they do exactly

684
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:52,930
p.m. train there's a lot of circuitry
equipment on car tops

685
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:56,119
that you can be interfering with if you
step in the wrong thing a trip over

686
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:56,819
something

687
00:36:56,819 --> 00:37:00,549
there's a lot of shit going on in there
you don't need to be on a cart opt

688
00:37:00,549 --> 00:37:02,190
unless you've been trained to be on our
top

689
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:05,430
there are even roping configuration
moving rope ship

690
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:09,930
on top of the car throw 21 you actually
have attraction ship with the ropes

691
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:14,239
moving and the traction ship car very
little place to stand for little place

692
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:17,859
to put equipment or any tools or
anything like that super duper dangerous

693
00:37:17,859 --> 00:37:21,519
so yeah whatever it's worth I mean you
have to know what you're getting

694
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:24,609
and it's sometimes hard to know what
you're getting into

695
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:27,599
because you're not in the industry
things the history will make sense to

696
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:27,979
you

697
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:31,509
taken away on how this works I'll not
that complicated right

698
00:37:31,509 --> 00:37:34,940
wash up down the elevator you do anyone
would think you do you turn the key to

699
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:38,390
hot

700
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,820
because it featured don't know on

701
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:44,380
and sat down is no shutdown shutdown

702
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:48,000
the mean running sometimes like to see
the shutdown switch on the label mg

703
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,110
ever see that motor generator DC our

704
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:54,490
car hitler's using DC an actual

705
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:58,320
you know base converting motor generator
sets converting the AC into the sea

706
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,520
so if you're turning the MGR your
effectively turning

707
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,490
so just because you think im read
something on the internet

708
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:09,620
you might not be an expert right we all
know how the internet really hard in

709
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,340
this building

710
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:13,610
but don't jump around the car top don't
screw around the host way

711
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:17,340
if you haven't learned it from an actual
expert that said

712
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:20,250
would you like to see a whole lot of
stuff very quickly about elevator

713
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,980
security and how it can be summer

714
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:27,420
okay we have a lot of we do a lot of
material we're a little late dr.

715
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:30,350
trickling in a little slow we're gonna
go as fast as we can we're gonna get

716
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,730
through as much as we can

717
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:35,460
and maybe saw I did well give me a big
no not to be slight a few minutes late

718
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,650
in the interactive trivia

719
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:40,320
cell disabling the whole called by us

720
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,050
right everybody thinks this is a great
idea

721
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:47,530
as really popular schools high schools
middle schools where kids are

722
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:51,390
you know old enough to know they can con
cause trouble pushing the buttons do to

723
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,160
create a nuisance

724
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,500
so a lot of time to see something like
this in the case of the one that

725
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,060
actually

726
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:59,380
on the left it's a situation where you
have to actually have the key to

727
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,290
register call

728
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:03,980
in the one that on the right you can
just toggle too I wanna allow people to

729
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,260
be able to write all

730
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:09,320
or maybe there's no all combines all
immediate need a key to

731
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:13,100
to go up or down and register call that
way right how many have you been in a

732
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,390
situation where

733
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:18,940
the actual button isn't a but when you
need to register you can watch a call

734
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,390
with a credential some kind

735
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:25,700
like you know a room key for example
anything that maybe like here on 46

736
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:30,680
exactly so these are always in trying to
restrict travel around the building

737
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:34,790
being able to say a certain buttons are
just locked out with these cutout piece

738
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:35,650
which is right

739
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:39,160
right and the reason you can actually
just have a key switch in the cab again

740
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,400
fire fighters operate the firefighter
had no button to push

741
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,630
they're not getting the floor and I can
create a situation so

742
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:49,840
code require be upon and you can have a
lockout but they can't interact with

743
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,280
each other

744
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:56,260
such a way ride so all the systems all
these credentials and say oh you need a

745
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:56,990
bad thing

746
00:39:56,990 --> 00:40:00,120
can go at this hour in the day all the
systems

747
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:04,130
are able to be subverted in one way or
another and we like to joke

748
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:07,770
that the only real secure solution this
kinda stuff is

749
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:10,810
like physically secure in the elevator
and by that I mean this

750
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:14,190
you see there's been a lot next to the
buttons Howard and tell you this like

751
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,620
was unlocking the bottom right

752
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:19,670
is real shit yeah this is from a
detention facility

753
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:23,230
and this is how they secured the
elevator on this actually was

754
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:26,860
a variance I was granted to them this is
not permitted by code but they were seen

755
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,960
the variance from a local

756
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,150
no building apartment given
circumstances and okay we understand

757
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:35,770
special security considerations go ahead
there that of course from an accident

758
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:36,850
site no

759
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:40,560
I'll let you use your imagination as to
what happened by up

760
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,400
but in general if you don't have a cane
you're on your own there

761
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,990
think I'm your elevator like an open
stairwell what would you do with the big

762
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:48,910
open stairwell

763
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:52,440
an office building to be secure you
invest to be a lot of pride

764
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:56,630
elevator should be in a little vestibule
situation on secure floors

765
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:59,800
otherwise in my opinion they are not
really that secure

766
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:04,140
would you like to see us take a big dump
over a motions hearing to show you

767
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:08,259
alright the so remember those like no I
can't register a floor call cuz I need a

768
00:41:08,259 --> 00:41:09,690
key I can get the elevator

769
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:13,670
we'll hear something envelope axe but

770
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:17,049
so what what happened there

771
00:41:17,049 --> 00:41:20,049
but then ships get a red yeah

772
00:41:20,049 --> 00:41:23,619
the elevator happen any platform to the
floor so they just not something the

773
00:41:23,619 --> 00:41:25,109
doors and trim the scanner edge

774
00:41:25,109 --> 00:41:28,460
not a universal track a lot of time
input disable doors

775
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:31,509
reachable position I've always wondered
what

776
00:41:31,509 --> 00:41:34,589
have a controller that was that worked
on by I it's always interesting to know

777
00:41:34,589 --> 00:41:35,609
that it works somewhere

778
00:41:35,609 --> 00:41:39,809
how about your a building where you can
get in like a month in a top-floor

779
00:41:39,809 --> 00:41:43,720
in on the right credentials again
uncanny resemblance yet this was a home

780
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,769
property and Phnom Penh Cambodia thing

781
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:50,009
right yeah so what if you want to get up
there in a key right

782
00:41:50,009 --> 00:41:53,660
here's what you doing this this is
something take this one home you can try

783
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,420
this yourself

784
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:57,059
yours numbering anything you're not
gonna kill yourself and that's why I am

785
00:41:57,059 --> 00:41:58,109
really happy to share

786
00:41:58,109 --> 00:42:01,999
the answer is keep registering up calls
to get as high as you can

787
00:42:01,999 --> 00:42:06,289
and from the top floor keep registering
up calls to bring elevators up

788
00:42:06,289 --> 00:42:09,769
if there's no one in an elevator send it
down manually

789
00:42:09,769 --> 00:42:12,819
because then the next up call you
register is going to call a different

790
00:42:12,819 --> 00:42:14,279
elevator and a different element

791
00:42:14,279 --> 00:42:18,569
and eventually you should be able to
catch an elevator with some

792
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:21,710
credential person just going up in going
to stop

793
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:24,930
for you and you just stand I'm gonna
kill me and right

794
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:28,460
elevator dispatching modern owner uses

795
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:33,099
call collective selective dispatch i
think is going to collect call a call

796
00:42:33,099 --> 00:42:35,150
and selective as in like just like

797
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:39,810
I don't know if yeah collective selected
is gonna keep going in the direction of

798
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:40,650
travel

799
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:41,790
we

800
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:45,100
tractors this case yet

801
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:51,330
we're going up he was going up like he
has gone up yes we are mister

802
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:58,330
of course pS Here Howard like everyone
else are

803
00:43:00,999 --> 00:43:04,349
I mean it's not like we're not a major
own and this one right here but not this

804
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:05,029
is a great

805
00:43:05,029 --> 00:43:08,419
like noted me sick Tripolis skill with

806
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:14,849
type you know escalation so the idea of
you know oh my gosh I can't believe I'm

807
00:43:14,849 --> 00:43:16,119
on the top floor that took

808
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:20,179
no equipment and took no credentials
that took me know there's like the Super

809
00:43:20,179 --> 00:43:21,709
allowance there's everything else

810
00:43:21,709 --> 00:43:24,880
now many buildings as you know from
being and testers

811
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,579
if you check other in or inability like
I'm not saying the elevators the

812
00:43:28,579 --> 00:43:32,429
only way to do this you might have a
door like maybe something like this out

813
00:43:32,429 --> 00:43:33,679
here to say okay

814
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:37,059
say 0 appeared

815
00:43:37,059 --> 00:43:44,059
picture I'm actually good sealer

816
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:50,200
I was totally enough self breast yeah

817
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:54,390
what do you need if you want to trigger

818
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:58,070
you know actual other operation and the
special features far away

819
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:01,620
you're talking keys key switches trigger

820
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:05,790
everything and knowing how to find which
key for which switched like you can see

821
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:07,530
this industry had a little graffiti

822
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:11,420
you know americans love their graffiti
so which switches which most elevator

823
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:14,070
folk don't track this kind of stuff that
you say are

824
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:17,330
I know I need these keys for these you
know this elevator this building

825
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:20,440
if you shop for inspection in his ass
from the desk when you get them in the

826
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,980
box if your first responder

827
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:25,700
this man is a little bit more touched in
the head

828
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:30,330
and he has been collecting a database in
these keys throughout his entire career

829
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:33,690
this man has a collection and keys

830
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:38,030
that are very impressive at this point
and he knows what

831
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:42,650
every last fucking love these do but I I
think it got so big I had to stop using

832
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:44,460
this plastic thing it does in a box

833
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:49,650
so every last one of these is a
manufacturer specific key

834
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:54,210
meaning it comes from the factory that
way every one of these brands are

835
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:54,970
fixtures

836
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:59,160
and there are older Brandon picture Rams
right thing right if aftermarket parts

837
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,380
yeah and craft elevators for small shops
on

838
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:04,590
by non-proprietary pictures an elevator

839
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:07,970
but Howard can walk into an elevator

840
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:11,280
and spot just by looking all I'll text
him on jobs

841
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,450
among all the idea for this for one but
you know I need he's like

842
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:18,360
Udonis Kaman recognize the buttons what
font is that a mic

843
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:21,410
I got security is coming around the
corner what is if you'd like

844
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:25,420
its FL installing them go but tell their
command yeah

845
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:29,230
so understanding that having the right
set of keys

846
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:33,960
will get you in a lot of situations but
now but for the most part not the crappy

847
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:37,130
that you can actually because for some
reason

848
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:40,930
a vendors that specialize in either
security stopper

849
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:42,180
fire product

850
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:45,099
or frankly elevator products well

851
00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:48,640
have made their own key set there's no
consistency

852
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,980
a lot of times they are inaccurate a lot
of time to cut wrong

853
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:55,630
or the case in this one which by the way
really awesome ima take picture straight

854
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:56,089
on

855
00:45:56,089 --> 00:46:01,079
facing he's right cell not only did they
do with a great favor

856
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:05,180
but they also put together the perfect
set if your fire truck roll thru all

857
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:07,589
seven of those states simultaneously

858
00:46:07,589 --> 00:46:10,790
because there's no fucking pattern here
they decided

859
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:13,810
a keeper somewhere to put it on there
yeah

860
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:17,180
the kind of sense you can usually buy
online they are

861
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:20,609
it is an issue with a lot of
misinformation going on you can search

862
00:46:20,609 --> 00:46:23,060
for these keys you can try to buy an
elevator key

863
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:26,550
you will often not know exactly what
you're getting unless you're

864
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,740
in the industry itself now the industry
itself

865
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:33,280
would be willing to say when I heard
this and she's really modernizing

866
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,339
what about this cutting edge systems as
as destination dispatch legacy knows a

867
00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:38,290
new hotels

868
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:41,980
what the first responders me buttons to
every floor

869
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:45,240
they are in the cab somewhere their
hidden behind a pal but they're still

870
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,069
there

871
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:49,290
fire service is still there emergency
operation still there

872
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:53,390
forget about being Lee in the future
this is an industry that is one way

873
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:54,190
still

874
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:58,140
in the past the industry has tried to
modernize and Donnie

875
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:02,910
really badly this is remote monitoring
through like lift net is a very popular

876
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:03,720
package

877
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:07,230
americanize the title bar yeah when
operating is running on

878
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:09,510
yeah

879
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:12,589
these are all supposed to be remote
management controls these are

880
00:47:12,589 --> 00:47:16,790
screenshots in the actual app this is
screen shotting from the actual user

881
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:17,650
manual its

882
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:20,770
publicly available online from live net
this

883
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:24,700
is the soup live this is like the login
password now there's no way that's akin

884
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,800
a they have a super ad may have been
right

885
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:31,130
different that's that's also in the same
time haha the

886
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:37,380
mcel a better controls like they haven't
they have a separate in a remote admin

887
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:39,069
told this is their user manual

888
00:47:39,069 --> 00:47:43,490
like make sure you open up you know a
special account is make sure set MC

889
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:44,420
support

890
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:47,880
you know I'm going to change your router
password MC support me just make

891
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,440
everything Mzee support

892
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,510
in case we need to get an I'll let you
know we can get in this box remotely

893
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:56,859
I have to say I'm MC he makes great
elevator products but they don't

894
00:47:56,859 --> 00:47:57,839
necessarily

895
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:00,910
have the most secure elevator so with
that being said

896
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:04,400
you know if I can switch I saw Nancy
controller I'm not thinking all this

897
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,569
shitty job by that I see that you know

898
00:48:07,569 --> 00:48:10,869
I start to wonder about what's going on
there XP screen but

899
00:48:10,869 --> 00:48:13,930
I did ask about it and they did tell me
not cool

900
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:17,299
we got extended support in

901
00:48:17,299 --> 00:48:21,190
but so imagine this being remote
accessible on your this might be on your

902
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:22,700
right now for all you know

903
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:26,410
depending on what elevator systems you
have by the way we we beg her

904
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:29,460
forgiveness and marketing we need like
another 15-20 minutes tops

905
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:33,180
okay you as a given that RN wanna show
you all the new stuff too

906
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:36,180
so the Big E

907
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:39,299
like the US earlier is there like a
universal elevator key

908
00:48:39,299 --> 00:48:45,660
various it was defined in Code what code
initially only come out as the 2007 2007

909
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:47,829
they define the FE okay one

910
00:48:47,829 --> 00:48:50,930
which was going to be like the Super
granddaddy in

911
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:53,990
being all others firefighters service
mode key

912
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:58,880
so of course when they published the
code document asked me put my direct

913
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,680
billing code

914
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,270
in the document

915
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:05,710
for this key like that Milan Fashion

916
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:10,260
yeah

917
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:15,070
like what's this actually a playing man
and it's been that way for a while

918
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:18,940
I get worse so most code is not
retroactive

919
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:22,910
so this would not apply if your elevator
was built to code

920
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:26,859
prior to the 2007 but the state of
Vermont said

921
00:49:26,859 --> 00:49:32,589
no hot that were retroactively gonna
require people to install at the OK once

922
00:49:32,589 --> 00:49:33,050
which

923
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:36,930
saw if you're building owner in vermont
am really sorry to break it to you

924
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:42,849
by you just bought she he switches yeah
every other matter much every okay one

925
00:49:42,849 --> 00:49:46,829
what depend testers do how do we
leverage the stuff we should already

926
00:49:46,829 --> 00:49:48,050
makes making a sense

927
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:52,619
if we have the right keys on a job we're
just going to slide around a building in

928
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:53,730
ways they can expect

929
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:57,140
there was a job that we had when the
front desk was the guard

930
00:49:57,140 --> 00:50:00,950
but there was an elevator in the back
row house now you weren't supposed to be

931
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:03,070
able that credentials to take this
elevator up

932
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:06,390
you get like for the parking deck and
get to it what do we do

933
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:10,060
well use in a video House on the Left
you'll see the video they actually

934
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:11,960
polled from the surveillance on the
right

935
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:15,240
and they didn't believe it when we tried
to explain he said all right

936
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:20,040
well your back door can be locked in a
manner that's one thing and then we were

937
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,470
able to call this elevator

938
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:25,450
and again we should be able to drive
upstairs right but

939
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:28,520
we said look on camera and see how fast
we will do this

940
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:31,970
they want place to both

941
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:35,040
that was all we needed to flip the
elevator fire service no

942
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:39,250
and driving up to the next floor and
because the culture in this building

943
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:42,819
once we popped out on the main level
everyone just assumed you must have come

944
00:50:42,819 --> 00:50:44,170
through you know the mom

945
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:47,369
so yeah of course you belong up here
right I mean you have this all white bad

946
00:50:47,369 --> 00:50:50,680
the same thing on it but sure enough
here in the building now

947
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:54,450
and that's all it took it took like two
seconds

948
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:58,190
at the switches to be able to change
modes in this elevator and getting

949
00:50:58,190 --> 00:50:59,670
going back to

950
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:02,990
disclaimer though it's worth pointing
out that elevator resulted

951
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:07,230
the elevator ultimately was very unhappy
how quickly throwing he switches on/off

952
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:10,710
and it did Paul tell and there was a a
reset procedure

953
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:14,460
him quite yet in the chromatin validly
probably most people in this room

954
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:20,200
table yeah so that idea I'm going in the
back door just going up the elevator

955
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,450
that was something that blew my mind in
this building or because they didn't

956
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:25,640
think that we possibly know any
credentials on

957
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:31,710
premium the key so i think is the key
speaking Okies how many people saw this

958
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:35,160
article in your post about the ice on
the fire kings exactly

959
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,720
and I love the Post said it's okay we
checked with a locksmith who said it's

960
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,720
okay to print these photos because no
one can ever make duplicates on these

961
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:42,200
news

962
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:46,030
and they were like she went out this guy
making out been worse than Hitler

963
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:50,319
he was just over tired locksmith selling
these keys without really caring who is

964
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:51,049
selling two

965
00:51:51,049 --> 00:51:54,299
he knew he was doing million you know
yeah in here

966
00:51:54,299 --> 00:51:58,099
but let me just tell you here's a much
better resolution photo anti-matter

967
00:51:58,099 --> 00:52:03,049
you'll see when this is not a major
security breach this is the famous 20

968
00:52:03,049 --> 00:52:06,410
642 key the New York City key for all
fire

969
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:09,540
coating your the building code is 2642

970
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:13,490
I'll like it's not crazy that that's
actually an impact on you for spending

971
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:13,970
cuts

972
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:19,030
million that so it's not like he was
selling this amazing top secret key no

973
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:19,910
one knew what it was

974
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:23,690
it min name on the key and we met
friends of ours just

975
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:30,690
carving and obvious blank yes how to
protect themselves from that

976
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,720
you know and really comes down to if
you're you're in a situation where

977
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,260
there's a regional key required

978
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:41,950
you're gonna have to convince your local
code official you need a very good luck

979
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:46,819
yeah good luck flames in the all now
there is something there is actually in

980
00:52:46,819 --> 00:52:47,940
that section of the code

981
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:50,800
allows like you l 10:37 rated

982
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,610
anti-theft device to be used as a key
box for certain situations if

983
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:58,760
at the language I think it's like if
it's impractical technically impossible

984
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,740
or like something else or like you know
it

985
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:05,110
technically financially impossible some
combination those words and

986
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:08,490
you can get a variance based on the code
you can justify

987
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:11,650
or into the political officials ahead
secure

988
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:16,480
slot to mir homework I work with your
fire department by

989
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,950
you know you can't you can't do this but
that's not all that

990
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:24,810
and that unfortunately what the code has
shut down people's throats so yeah

991
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:27,840
taken away from it Tony our top so much
as we are

992
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:31,130
saying can we like talk about how she
just how it is

993
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:34,530
with regard to security because no to
talk about I dot

994
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:38,740
yeah there's not just like a citywide
gene this is the key to buy stuff or

995
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:39,510
fuckin States

996
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:43,130
the 3502 key which again

997
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:47,870
is a unrestricted people I could sing l2
and you can totally see the billing code

998
00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:49,360
just by looking at the god damn thing

999
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:53,270
there's this one that applies the entire
state to see you this is a hilarious

1000
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:55,020
story when you try to order it right

1001
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:59,760
yep so I obviously I want to copy this
so you know I found out you can buy

1002
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,100
various piece of equipment that come
with keys without keys

1003
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:06,120
I ordered Tennessee key box I gotta

1004
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:09,120

1009
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:28,060
it's like you can't walk in a head shop
and say I need by the ball

1010
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:32,450
for you like I would like this class
pipes are and the like of course when

1011
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:33,000
weighing

1012
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,270
so you can buy all the game well
Christmas tree he's you what

1013
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:40,940
you just can't buy the Tennessee

1014
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:44,360
I know this is really where nothing is
up Indiana

1015
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:47,760
in the anime is the key box in city
Miller G you guys know how hard it is to

1016
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,210
pick you were doing in the village

1017
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:52,780
but again you can order the box you just
can't order the key

1018
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:56,560
but how many have you have ever work to
the tomb in Iraq right

1019
00:54:56,560 --> 00:55:00,730
how many you never use it to pay write
something you were doing it today

1020
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:04,700
they come with that little key gauge and
if you get a tubular key cutter

1021
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:08,750
you can just make your own and there you
go we must cut our own Indiana key that

1022
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:09,240
opens up

1023
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:13,000
all the Indiana stinking boxes there's
the Indiana key code right there that's

1024
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,340
another whole state liking

1025
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:18,240
there's a number of states that have
moved to medical

1026
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:21,240
like Kentucky we got some fans on
Bourbon in Derby Conn in this room I

1027
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:21,820
imagine

1028
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:25,810
Kentucky uses a medical classic style
camlock

1029
00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:29,470
but you can order the box get what are
the key

1030
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:33,060
you nor the key box and as anyone knows
if it ships

1031
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:36,230
open which it does see you can mountain
thing on your wall

1032
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:40,920
you can take apart the cam lock if you
take a cam often pull plug out

1033
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:45,010
you can then just take it apart very
carefully by D capping it in your room

1034
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:46,070
at like Def Con

1035
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:49,270
you say okay let's dump all these little
pins out here

1036
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:53,320
let's get that put it on my spinning
tray with our medic opening measurements

1037
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:56,630
there we are there's our cameras looking
into the code for the codes

1038
00:55:56,630 --> 00:56:00,630
alright wrote that down let's put it
back together and put the top plate back

1039
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:01,110
on it

1040
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:05,260
a reinstall and return it like this did
not meet our box of all means thank you

1041
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:09,460
few days the medical key for all Africa
say the Kentucky right there

1042
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:13,590

1043
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:18,000
everything you can or in the Florida
Keys boxes and the Florida key switches

1044
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,070
Florida zone 4 let's take that sucker
part

1045
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:25,390
02 m3 it's not like it that much more
complicated you can still measure the

1046
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:26,660
cuts they're just more

1047
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:30,940
biaxial nature to it let's take those
apart upstairs the Florida zone for that

1048
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:31,830
all Tampa

1049
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:36,660
oh and that's also is on 6s Orlando oh

1050
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:40,540
these are supposed to be stupid
restricted key that no one should have

1051
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:43,710
but if you can buy the lock like the
Louisiana lock

1052
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:48,050
or maybe the virginia law like we've
stepped through these medical keys

1053
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:49,570
take in the fall apart

1054
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:53,930
measured them and usually return million
they're expensive not to mention

1055
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:59,250
that code documents are great thing
patent documents like this is the SK

1056
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:02,990
we're pretty sure it's all one key way:
that is 1 p.m. black

1057
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:06,950
so that you can get this restricted
black or you can cut the money the entry

1058
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:10,760
you can then make your own medical keys
and if you didn't know what blind it was

1059
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:15,060
that's a really nice dimensional drawing
that the cease-fire catalog has in it

1060
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:16,760
thank you very much for that cease-fire

1061
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:20,270
Anaheim so we could just do this all day

1062
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:23,360
the idea of statewide by code

1063
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:27,100
Fire cheats they exist this is a real
frickin thing

1064
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:31,260
and it's worth pointing out that I this
is all kinda coming out I think

1065
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:31,870
personally

1066
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:36,730
speculation of medical I think I leaned
on from this code committees

1067
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:40,660
especially with NFPA that was driving
Florida Virginia

1068
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:44,310
easy and adoption on medico standard for
their state

1069
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:47,990
because it actually they've adopted a
standard ask and protected

1070
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:51,470
asked me back to restricted the keys
have to be serialized

1071
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:56,010
application process base State Fire
Marshal that being said

1072
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:59,340
there's also an order form companies
leaning on a state I'm how to get

1073
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:04,500
I Rhode Island's moment we're so there
you see there's a key in Flint WT 01

1074
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:08,050
that he existed long before the state or
I'll never adopted

1075
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:11,050
a comical Adams which is now division
Schindler elevator

1076
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:14,280
and use that key forever somehow

1077
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:18,790
Rylan said we want is there anything
about the key that makes that desire

1078
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:23,490
now just plain old favorites on a white
13 key blank

1079
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:26,590
you knowing anybody can can get that
every cop it doesn't make any sense

1080
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:33,590
question I have not heard of him doing
that lol right I'm questions the funny

1081
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:39,370
3d printers yes and scholars not people
in 3d printed a lot of hard to get keys

1082
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:43,220
this knowledge is still pretty
restricted like you were tryna leave

1083
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:46,690
like someone is out for people watching
at home not make any fees

1084
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:50,480
on but I mean once this knowledge gets
out and probably will eventually

1085
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,859
I'm sure people will be making these
keys by any means and we're not saying

1086
00:58:54,859 --> 00:58:55,440
that like

1087
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,829
these are bad blocks per set we're not
saying like medicos alt route marked by

1088
00:58:58,829 --> 00:58:59,200
rising

1089
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:02,250
appear we're not saying medicos like the
worst thing ever

1090
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:05,359
you all need to go get like fish AF
three keys and stuff

1091
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:08,390
no you can't the books cylinders and I
cylinder

1092
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:11,859
but don't consider them iron-clad
one-stop-shop security

1093
00:59:11,859 --> 00:59:15,400
don't consider that like you're not box
or your key box

1094
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:22,400
will always be secure like yeah

1095
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:29,520
people lose not box teams thank goodness

1096
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:37,359
against them I'm sure she can copy it
for hehehe right

1097
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:40,690
so yeah these little key boxes and

1098
00:59:40,690 --> 00:59:44,160
you know how their use just because you
see a key box somewhere

1099
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:48,079
you at all levels but the spanking and
that they may not be to code

1100
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:50,880
they may not be where they belong they
may just be on our hotel room or

1101
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,680
something like that and

1102
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:56,460
the idea %uh like all no one could ever
get that key

1103
00:59:56,460 --> 01:00:00,170
the at like me power rails against epi
okay one

1104
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:04,460
the fact that it was pushed it was ran
down in yes yeah

1105
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:07,660
back to tubular key was adopted for this
purpose

1106
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:11,349
and is being all adopted for this
purpose in jurisdictions that have

1107
01:00:11,349 --> 01:00:16,210
adopted that level kanya isms server and
the basically if you think one other

1108
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:18,710
thing away from stocks I don't do this
yourself

1109
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:23,359
this standard die right now and I've
been I've been very vocal about that

1110
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:27,089
and you guys can take that back from
your side

1111
01:00:27,089 --> 01:00:29,720
don't you know you at building owners
are represented as a building owners

1112
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:33,349
pushed back and tell your code official
I am NOT putting this is Michael

1113
01:00:33,349 --> 01:00:36,910
around a guy going on in trouble New
York Post and elsewhere

1114
01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:40,589
he was like selling the keys and he was
some retired locksmith spock

1115
01:00:40,589 --> 01:00:44,250
right this vendor wannabes to ISA which
Mander

1116
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:48,099
one of these is an actual industry
vendor arm the other straight on the in

1117
01:00:48,099 --> 01:00:48,680
enormous

1118
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:53,280
killing a whirl and they are now just
flagrantly selling these keys to anyone

1119
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:56,870
Bay just through you know FAQ there's
like a sock puppet company

1120
01:00:56,870 --> 01:01:00,410
don't want to use our name that could
get weird but this had the same

1121
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:03,510
what's old is new again and this is
still happening so

1122
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:07,930
be aware also one other note regarding
the hoist way and security

1123
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:11,610
yes it's dangerous remembers dangerous
don't ever do your %uh see here

1124
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:14,720
do you think inside the voice way

1125
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:18,490
those waste main doors have any security
or locks for the most part

1126
01:01:18,490 --> 01:01:22,560
noon so if you are able

1127
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:26,540
to never do this right in watching if
you are able

1128
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:29,930
to seize an elevator on and test or
something

1129
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:32,970
you'll see the surveillance on where we
are right now

1130
01:01:32,970 --> 01:01:37,170
and appears where we want to be on back
our top

1131
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:41,200
there are controls to drive the elevator
they are the same

1132
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:45,990
you control the universe China controls
if you have those controls

1133
01:01:45,990 --> 01:01:49,430
and you want to get somewhere the
elevator does not want to go

1134
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:52,900
you will be able to get there and once
you are there

1135
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:57,390
you'll be able to get out without any
hine on restriction the exception being

1136
01:01:57,390 --> 01:01:58,230
the lowest

1137
01:01:58,230 --> 01:02:01,790
cars I was gonna younger through the
little

1138
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:08,430
Aspire all right so here we are my
mother hen in this video and she was

1139
01:02:08,430 --> 01:02:08,700
like

1140
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:12,390
you and i won where josh is dropping
she's watching the show has been one for

1141
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:13,490
clinton to work

1142
01:02:13,490 --> 01:02:17,370
so sure enough there we are you
traveling the voiced way

1143
01:02:17,370 --> 01:02:23,120
on the Car Talk going up to the next
floor

1144
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:27,620
which was restricted for not platform
level obviously with what

1145
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:32,000
warming the car top at the engine more
and then there's a release

1146
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,080
no security no no clutches whole

1147
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:39,920
yeah I mean if someone was watching
Harry Hamlin 11 11

1148
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:43,680
how many people watched security cameras
in building now in its

1149
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,690
if you control that or force

1150
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:49,900
if you get into a moderate if you're in
a motel room

1151
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:55,030
you are effectively got there are things
you can do from a motor room

1152
01:02:55,030 --> 01:02:58,660
and Howard has great analogy right yeah
I mean you guys all get different levels

1153
01:02:58,660 --> 01:02:59,810
like access and I T

1154
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:03,120
but the reason machine particularly
dangerous

1155
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:06,940
a particularly powerful is because since
the controllers making all the decisions

1156
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:10,260
bypassing or you know creating sir
conception

1157
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:14,700
normally be created gives you a level
controller parameters universe

1158
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:18,370
right like oh yeah limit switch that
limits which no longer exists

1159
01:03:18,370 --> 01:03:22,650
rights and now you can over travel you
can crash in

1160
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:26,100
no things like that yeah your you're
changing

1161
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:29,680
the way the elevator perceive the world
now and you can see how that could be a

1162
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:30,050
problem

1163
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:33,720
and it's all done with simple little
jumpers while most the time is just

1164
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:37,100
so like you know one-timer on inspection

1165
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:41,040
we find this is a what's going on here
you got a jumper on the controller

1166
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:44,500
god-like oh no it's cool because see you
know it's just

1167
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:47,430
because the real aim wasn't working
right summers like jumping out hard

1168
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:47,840
relay

1169
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:49,870
not let up

1170
01:03:49,870 --> 01:03:52,790
located but this is great

1171
01:03:52,790 --> 01:03:56,860
right looking for the graffiti inside
when the owner folks leave the notes to

1172
01:03:56,860 --> 01:03:57,470
each other

1173
01:03:57,470 --> 01:04:02,000
that's all jumper no protests and doing
things and jumping out very safeties and

1174
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:02,430
sister

1175
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:06,700
because during a test this man as he
says going to remake the universe

1176
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:11,060
and do something like for example like
what's happening here the five-year

1177
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:14,190
to protect semi-annual annual

1178
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:18,070
five-year type

1179
01:04:18,070 --> 01:04:25,070
five-year test speed

1180
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:33,270
with everything's fine feel they're
supposed to do that

1181
01:04:33,270 --> 01:04:36,930
it I survive there's no one here course
yeah

1182
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:42,190
right think yeah

1183
01:04:42,190 --> 01:04:45,210
but that's like when the president ever
gets in an elevator

1184
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:48,789
you know there's not a secret service
elevator with him or her

1185
01:04:48,789 --> 01:04:52,640
there is someone in the machine room
with a cop in an elevator tech for that

1186
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:53,190
building

1187
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:56,740
and there could be a situation where
like you know the terrorists and I

1188
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:57,539
sister like

1189
01:04:57,539 --> 01:05:01,599
reaching through the cab went right now
I tried to stab the president

1190
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:06,559
and they're grabbing the good ol boys
play they can jump out almost like

1191
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:10,220
move it now with an outlet now they can
jump out almost or safeties

1192
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:13,710
and just drive elevator down get into
the garage getting out the building

1193
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:17,020
you can jump out everything was very
high I was just in case there was an

1194
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:18,890
entrapment but yeah that's my

1195
01:05:18,890 --> 01:05:23,299
alright maybe I have been well let's
dispense

1196
01:05:23,299 --> 01:05:26,599
with a couple other things that people
might not know some other miss

1197
01:05:26,599 --> 01:05:29,329
thank you by the way the next few
minutes we are doing well when we are

1198
01:05:29,329 --> 01:05:30,740
you guys still enjoying this by the way

1199
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:37,470
alright yeah everybody tell your friends
that if they ever pretend the door close

1200
01:05:37,470 --> 01:05:38,150
but hack

1201
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:41,260
is a thing you're allowed to kick him in
the balls like that's actually an

1202
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:42,780
elevator Co if someone says that

1203
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:47,230
you everybody in the other issue got to
hit alarm call cancel all the floor

1204
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:47,670
buttons

1205
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:50,670
and jammed the door with your day at the
same time that perhaps

1206
01:05:50,670 --> 01:05:52,720
yeah

1207
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:55,500
now let's talk about real elevator acts
for a minute in the industry

1208
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:58,850
okay right now we're looking at a relay
logic controller right

1209
01:05:58,850 --> 01:06:01,960
they see that there's an armature that
can move their complete a circular

1210
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:05,520
right well what if you move the armature
right

1211
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:09,070
with a pencil I was like super popular
back in the day

1212
01:06:09,070 --> 01:06:13,430
or if you store really all of that
decision making

1213
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:17,490
but that controllers capable of doing
goes out the window if you're holding in

1214
01:06:17,490 --> 01:06:20,990
the motor know that the actual hoist
motor contactor not not just

1215
01:06:20,990 --> 01:06:25,090
the rethink a relay the difference in a
relay contactor right like a contactor

1216
01:06:25,090 --> 01:06:28,190
cable handling more power right so

1217
01:06:28,190 --> 01:06:31,630
pushing the contact for the motor pushin
offered al contactor

1218
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:35,490
guess what elevators move back on track
speed even if its doors are open

1219
01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:39,130
even if its eyes finals rat in a bit on
its final there's a lot of steps are

1220
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:43,440
supposed to take the elevators final out
but elevator guys will be like guess

1221
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:43,820
what

1222
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:48,910
is moving Charlie Nana's finals yeah
it's gonna be a good reset

1223
01:06:48,910 --> 01:06:53,220
line this is our friends in common is
another 5 p.m. on Friday

1224
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:56,470
fact that there's a there's an
expression we have the right way

1225
01:06:56,470 --> 01:07:03,300
the wrong way and on the elevator guy
way which is the wrong way much faster

1226
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:07,010
cell this is a as a selector looks older
than the one you saw because

1227
01:07:07,010 --> 01:07:11,100
more permanent but instead like an
actual magnetic strip in a rain sensor

1228
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:14,470
it's basically just a steelman as those
as the you add

1229
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:18,100
sensors actually approaching steelman
it's you know easier optical or magnetic

1230
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:20,030
I honestly don't know what that
particular

1231
01:07:20,030 --> 01:07:24,410
uses but eventually be completely
occluded by that and that's what level

1232
01:07:24,410 --> 01:07:25,030
with the floor

1233
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:28,190
thing yes that Bayesian never

1234
01:07:28,190 --> 01:07:33,360
so if you're on a job the elevators no
not leveling right or something its 430

1235
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:34,140
on Friday

1236
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:37,980
and he said he saw I know what I wanna
do on a move the main

1237
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:41,170
that Bain been there thirty years

1238
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:44,510
think that's the solution suddenly no it
is then

1239
01:07:44,510 --> 01:07:48,980
yeah right mister anything else that you
have crazy unintended consequences but

1240
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:49,280
like

1241
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:52,750
thats something that we've seen before
that I guys moving and they're like

1242
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:56,200
surprise that oh yeah so many trips and
felt I could tell there was a level on a

1243
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:56,990
different floor

1244
01:07:56,990 --> 01:08:01,390
%ah that's weird what if your elevator
keeps dropping

1245
01:08:01,390 --> 01:08:04,870
like when it's supposed to be platform
but not because your high horse owners

1246
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:05,980
leaking or something

1247
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:10,800
White Rock systems legal but anyway
where so this is an interesting one

1248
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:14,450
the bottom of a roll tide roll this
attraction ship up there the roads are

1249
01:08:14,450 --> 01:08:17,290
going on that and NEC the jacket and a
lift up traction

1250
01:08:17,290 --> 01:08:20,839
the ropes right so apparently was
bottoming out to the like

1251
01:08:20,839 --> 01:08:24,580
you know they're 6 all kinda

1252
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:28,580
gentlemen there this way you know when
it loses its pressure and a set of balls

1253
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:32,559
yep this is an industry in Mandan man

1254
01:08:32,559 --> 01:08:36,069
in some buildings I think like how do
you work on his car

1255
01:08:36,069 --> 01:08:39,199
inspection no work stops which only but

1256
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:42,889
now this is not again you're not gonna
die

1257
01:08:42,889 --> 01:08:46,699
but this is how entrapment happen this
is how breakdowns happen

1258
01:08:46,699 --> 01:08:50,589
because the industry doesn't paying the
right person in the right job

1259
01:08:50,589 --> 01:08:54,059
and somebody just make make it quick and
fast is running again

1260
01:08:54,059 --> 01:08:58,349
cool I'm outta here this was a very
famous case that our

1261
01:08:58,349 --> 01:09:01,789
worked on and it wasn't it was actually
really bad injury

1262
01:09:01,789 --> 01:09:05,409
he is an elevator was running with the
winners on doors closing on the way

1263
01:09:05,409 --> 01:09:09,339
and if you don't think again just to
prove to you this is completely possible

1264
01:09:09,339 --> 01:09:13,059
this is video in a shot for the
testimony elevators are never supposed

1265
01:09:13,059 --> 01:09:14,460
to do when you're about to see

1266
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:18,119
their doors are open

1267
01:09:18,119 --> 01:09:21,460
world

1268
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:25,730
II and when the actual case a woman was

1269
01:09:25,730 --> 01:09:29,369
in the middle other the norm happen
watching yeah it's bad

1270
01:09:29,369 --> 01:09:32,519
but I mean that's all because they were
in the motor room

1271
01:09:32,519 --> 01:09:35,519
jump ring out certain contact day now
you have it

1272
01:09:35,519 --> 01:09:39,489
they were recreating it for court than
ever my cousin records right now

1273
01:09:39,489 --> 01:09:44,900
yeah the only demands Bernard but that's
the idea if you're in the motor room

1274
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:48,699
you absolutely can remake the universe
now

1275
01:09:48,699 --> 01:09:52,019
we've been pretty gracious on time we
have we had a whole section

1276
01:09:52,019 --> 01:09:55,730
on like freaking involves we gotta get a
thumbs up or thumbs down whether we can

1277
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:56,320
talk about

1278
01:09:56,320 --> 01:10:00,559
alright money what say you guys that
right

1279
01:10:00,559 --> 01:10:04,570
alright alright so here in trapped in
elevator

1280
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:11,570
sometimes yes ma'am

1281
01:10:12,449 --> 01:10:15,969
so the wind was blowing so hard there
was a draft and the door can close the

1282
01:10:15,969 --> 01:10:18,040
only hope I wouldn't travel at that
point that right

1283
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:21,250
right okay yes just grabbing shot

1284
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:25,909
don't don't have time to that and so you
wanna be trapped when you slam the door

1285
01:10:25,909 --> 01:10:26,420
lock

1286
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:31,139
so some elevators will not just in when
registering alert upstairs to say hey

1287
01:10:31,139 --> 01:10:32,389
somebody is pretty screwed

1288
01:10:32,389 --> 01:10:36,650
most elevator should have a phone right
you know the scene is safety word about

1289
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:37,429
phones yeah

1290
01:10:37,429 --> 01:10:41,469
actually iPhone shortfall going on a
boat now like the big thing is just

1291
01:10:41,469 --> 01:10:42,340
pushing a button

1292
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:45,489
a button will trigger a phone call
prerecorded message

1293
01:10:45,489 --> 01:10:49,340
the idea being that for accessibility
reasons a person may be unable to

1294
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:50,010
communicate

1295
01:10:50,010 --> 01:10:53,050
for language reasons or they're unable
to speak

1296
01:10:53,050 --> 01:10:56,480
for you know whether to rest or physical
issue and

1297
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:01,070
Norman you have a heart attack cambrian
ideas that now use forces people to push

1298
01:11:01,070 --> 01:11:03,020
a button and get help but

1299
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:08,510
but traditionally owners had tell and
those telephones hotlines I came all the

1300
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:09,780
way through the traveling cable

1301
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:13,650
through the motor room for the traveling
came back into the cat so sometimes I

1302
01:11:13,650 --> 01:11:13,900
like

1303
01:11:13,889 --> 01:11:17,619
large job know you'll see things are
tied to the PBX system so you know there

1304
01:11:17,619 --> 01:11:18,889
is an extension somewhere

1305
01:11:18,889 --> 01:11:22,829
on time just of on these phones were
incompatible

1306
01:11:22,829 --> 01:11:26,119
a lot like digital systems right like
it's just meant to happen hotline

1307
01:11:26,119 --> 01:11:29,420
that's just that's what you're gonna get
could anybody in this room do something

1308
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:32,639
fun with it unprotected phone line and I
just stumbled across somewhere

1309
01:11:32,639 --> 01:11:35,880
i maybe borrow someone like this in your
pen test back

1310
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:40,250
but also this is something that hackers
have done for a while as if you can get

1311
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:41,409
the actual phone

1312
01:11:41,409 --> 01:11:46,040
number for that line like I know maybe
is written inside out

1313
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:49,440
or maybe it's on a plaque outside and I
don't know why you need it on a plaque

1314
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:52,810
but calling the phone it will usually do
what

1315
01:11:52,810 --> 01:11:56,060
connect you directly through the phone
so

1316
01:11:56,060 --> 01:12:00,260
silently if you're into war dialing and
those violent numbers you get every once

1317
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:00,810
in a while

1318
01:12:00,810 --> 01:12:04,179
think twice about it may be said on for
a little bit see the star here

1319
01:12:04,179 --> 01:12:08,639
you could call an elevator and start
talking to the occupants and I don't

1320
01:12:08,639 --> 01:12:11,300
think I think the credit feel like

1321
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:14,610
I'm watching you go up and down but

1322
01:12:14,610 --> 01:12:17,350
I prefer I prefer going helping
terminally

1323
01:12:17,350 --> 01:12:19,460
elevator

1324
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:23,219
but the bigger issue is far security is
concerned is not calling and talking

1325
01:12:23,219 --> 01:12:27,160
but calling and just listening there
have been actual instances

1326
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:30,890
a high-value target knowing people know
where they're staying in town if there's

1327
01:12:30,890 --> 01:12:31,610
a big meeting them

1328
01:12:31,610 --> 01:12:34,920
you know State Department ok people
calling the elevator lines

1329
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:38,670
and just listening to talk is how many
people and like private conversations in

1330
01:12:38,670 --> 01:12:39,290
an open-air

1331
01:12:39,290 --> 01:12:43,010
it is little enclosed space just for you
and whoever is in there and that's a

1332
01:12:43,010 --> 01:12:44,640
really big security risk

1333
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:47,890
if you're just above the motel room
there's just an intercom in the motor

1334
01:12:47,890 --> 01:12:48,290
room

1335
01:12:48,290 --> 01:12:51,940
you can listen to what's going on it is
not like there's ringing in the cab

1336
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:55,410
whenever anybody is actually apps
actually in there

1337
01:12:55,410 --> 01:12:59,880
just you know talking so there's a few
more notes we can give you

1338
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:03,239
we want to send you home if you have any
control over your buildings and such

1339
01:13:03,239 --> 01:13:04,670
wanna send you on some advice

1340
01:13:04,670 --> 01:13:09,199
to watch out for a few things cell
entrapment to the biggest problem right

1341
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:11,820
entrapment a pretty common you really
shouldn't have a whole like a lot

1342
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:13,969
unexpected shutdown trapped in a
building

1343
01:13:13,969 --> 01:13:17,610
I'm the sorta rule tom is that like a
typical office building

1344
01:13:17,610 --> 01:13:20,610
a car might unexpectedly shut down a
couple times a year

1345
01:13:20,610 --> 01:13:23,820
might entrap somebody in here having
repeated entrapment

1346
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:28,739
like that just happen problem not having
the phone work

1347
01:13:28,739 --> 01:13:31,860
phones not working is huge thing you
know

1348
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:36,120
wanna Basti violations right frankly the
phone and work great

1349
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:40,550
that one up I thought this was an
unusual on it and apparently not

1350
01:13:40,550 --> 01:13:43,560
and your comments just speaker you just
have to shout

1351
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:46,699
hope someone hears you somewhere to
build like yeah

1352
01:13:46,699 --> 01:13:50,460
have a proper damn phone in your
elevator how many alarm bell work

1353
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:53,620
yeah alarm bell is also supposed to go
off stop

1354
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:57,540
Polar Plunge that rule has changed over
the years the code

1355
01:13:57,540 --> 01:14:01,929
did require more minute didn't require
an alarming had a keen stop switch

1356
01:14:01,929 --> 01:14:03,700
back

1357
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:06,190
so basically regardless

1358
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:10,170
%uh what code you're supposed to be on
sure your buttons work the alarm on

1359
01:14:10,170 --> 01:14:11,230
Channel yeah

1360
01:14:11,230 --> 01:14:14,560
make sure that people can just stumble
accidentally someone to building an

1361
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:15,280
invoice way

1362
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:18,950
PlayStation never be it's not like in
the movies where you can just get in and

1363
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:19,990
out a host way

1364
01:14:19,990 --> 01:14:23,250
and sneak around a building the hoist
one doesn't have pushed back it doesn't

1365
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:24,390
connect and events

1366
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:27,650
it's not supposed to connect to anything
you're not supposed to be a more

1367
01:14:27,650 --> 01:14:30,720
just look in the hoist way and like
climb in there

1368
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:34,060
as a ride around on a counterweight like
a fine jackass like

1369
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:38,280
look at that mother fucker don't do that

1370
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:41,760
like and we're talking about this like
horse response to be firing

1371
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:45,810
ike I look at that picture he had their
I like how did this even happen

1372
01:14:45,810 --> 01:14:49,870
who improved yeah motor room doors

1373
01:14:49,870 --> 01:14:53,450
exposed to me so closings of walking
right right just let only worth like

1374
01:14:53,450 --> 01:14:54,550
this one yeah

1375
01:14:54,550 --> 01:14:59,170
bus pass compliant you're only supposed
to have been authorized personnel only

1376
01:14:59,170 --> 01:15:01,910
elevator person out with people who have
actually been trained in the

1377
01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:04,860
construction maintenance repair testing
and inspection honors

1378
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:09,120
like that guy no yeah motor rooms are
dangerous

1379
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:13,010
proper tax on the ones mostly in their
if you're failing

1380
01:15:13,010 --> 01:15:17,710
your maintenance control procedures if
people are coming to inspector MCP

1381
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:21,320
and there's actually nothing working on
it like

1382
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:25,100
from an accident site yeah Geithner
coming right

1383
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:28,500
what you didn't even think is left blank
yeah

1384
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:32,320
if you're building owner and you're
worried that these jobs are being

1385
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:33,450
serviced correctly

1386
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:36,560
it's like having adopted get a second
opinion call someone else

1387
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:40,650
call him call anybody else can trust and
they will find things that someone else

1388
01:15:40,650 --> 01:15:41,620
might not be doing

1389
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:45,820
or the find Steuben may in fact like
this one right now this is a good one

1390
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:49,820
okay three-phase power right little
different than like a typical

1391
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:50,550
residential

1392
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:54,790
okay three-phase power is great for
large motors in a little bit more

1393
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:55,770
patient right

1394
01:15:55,770 --> 01:15:58,990
so the problem is though it one of those
phases blows a fuse

1395
01:15:58,990 --> 01:16:03,240
circuit Albany trip otherwise you end up
with something called single-phase

1396
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:06,550
right or basically motors gonna burn
itself not getting

1397
01:16:06,550 --> 01:16:09,610
the power that is expecting from the
supply okay for

1398
01:16:09,610 --> 01:16:13,430
this elevator as a main line disconnect
switch that has uses inside it

1399
01:16:13,430 --> 01:16:17,180
and this is what we found: letter now
accuses as I'm not to use it

1400
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:21,210
just is bar stock that is connected
across and when we found out what was

1401
01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:23,650
going on there like well you know how
the motor

1402
01:16:23,650 --> 01:16:27,690
muses as long a fair

1403
01:16:27,690 --> 01:16:31,920
if you can I solve it all so what this
is a cue track

1404
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:35,000
if you think they won't notice owner
inspector should notice this

1405
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,060
yeah I mean I I'm gonna build be fine

1406
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:41,910
this is a wire wrapped around a few
right so if you look at it from a

1407
01:16:41,910 --> 01:16:43,590
distance ago yeah looks good

1408
01:16:43,590 --> 01:16:46,630
you look closely and there's a tiny
strengthen their

1409
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:51,530
can help by passing like here's a relay
logic system we think it's healthy right

1410
01:16:51,530 --> 01:16:51,820
now

1411
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:55,480
that's all carbon dust handed conductive

1412
01:16:55,480 --> 01:17:00,090
all what could possibly go wrong yeah
this is realism and burning all the time

1413
01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:03,410
scattering conducting dust everywhere
what could possibly break in that

1414
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:10,410
that's before the same yeah %uh this is
great night you found in baghdad like II

1415
01:17:10,510 --> 01:17:15,680
store located with a cat motoring yet
know it's a hydraulic elevator

1416
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:19,830
I am leaks so we walk in we find all
this shit on the floor and we find a

1417
01:17:19,830 --> 01:17:20,640
drip pan

1418
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:25,480
under the mail passion that overflowing
that the tag

1419
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:30,870
is some murders like the oil pan to
center in the rat it's just nice

1420
01:17:30,870 --> 01:17:36,410
wording hydro oil every so why does this
kinda stuff happen there's conflict of

1421
01:17:36,410 --> 01:17:37,520
interest sometimes

1422
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,710
there's people who are like wink wink
nudge nudge you know we're totally doing

1423
01:17:40,710 --> 01:17:42,290
the job you pay us for

1424
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:45,530
like this tests on the Otis Elevator was
performed by

1425
01:17:45,530 --> 01:17:47,980
Otis well

1426
01:17:47,980 --> 01:17:51,040
but it's supposed to be a text name
right now

1427
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:54,710
you found a system once within been
billed for new

1428
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:59,270
k morning all Karim roping constantly
this was a two to one car

1429
01:17:59,270 --> 01:18:02,540
and so the thing as a end of the rope
the end of the rope like

1430
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:06,590
typical situation on public aren't on
the counter with there's a dead

1431
01:18:06,590 --> 01:18:10,449
called secondary room and that secondary
room involved like somebody my size

1432
01:18:10,449 --> 01:18:13,510
crawling in and being very uncomfortably
close to begin their

1433
01:18:13,510 --> 01:18:17,219
like I crawl then I found that test ACK
not a stagnant

1434
01:18:17,219 --> 01:18:20,679
as the essence of Baghdad its best 72

1435
01:18:20,679 --> 01:18:24,550
these roads had never been changed and
this was and their handlers hours and

1436
01:18:24,550 --> 01:18:24,980
hours

1437
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:28,190
every time it was a huge losses so

1438
01:18:28,190 --> 01:18:33,320
again if you are getting red tagged if
your shoes faulting out there's a reason

1439
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:33,889
for it

1440
01:18:33,889 --> 01:18:37,710
there's something went wrong %um
somebody somewhere wasn't listening

1441
01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:40,780
to someone and the people in the
industry who know

1442
01:18:40,780 --> 01:18:44,270
they barely read the stuff and I'll tell
you if you really want I love the next

1443
01:18:44,270 --> 01:18:45,510
footage there was a this was a

1444
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:48,650
find acceptance that's right and one of
the guys was like

1445
01:18:48,650 --> 01:18:52,250
this is not work Kelly Shoppach line

1446
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:55,420
the guy with masterful yet the manager
on the job

1447
01:18:55,420 --> 01:18:58,489
again there's a separation by labor

1448
01:18:58,489 --> 01:19:03,940
special position the managers like now
trust me this is fine run fast

1449
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:07,199
the guy and feels like tell you what I'm
gonna stand here with my camera

1450
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:11,940
you run it

1451
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:17,540
the

1452
01:19:17,540 --> 01:19:19,130
yeah thought my job

1453
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:22,080
stock you know everything all the work
you did it out the window yet to

1454
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:22,950
completely redo

1455
01:19:22,950 --> 01:19:27,060
tired meanwhile the rails here

1456
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:30,990
so in the end follow the right
procedures if people are coming in

1457
01:19:30,990 --> 01:19:33,250
saying they're the elevator folk like we
did the Sun

1458
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:36,700
te sol federal testing other I do it
just as like a fantastic

1459
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:40,040
unlike yeah I'm here to get in the only
nominee local official

1460
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:44,340
I'm not doing an elevator except in some
just breaking in but if your security

1461
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:44,930
guard

1462
01:19:44,930 --> 01:19:48,380
is an elevator fire that security guard

1463
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:52,590
it should not be the elevator the final
story we're gonna give you is one that

1464
01:19:52,590 --> 01:19:53,730
Howard encounter right

1465
01:19:53,730 --> 01:19:58,110
yeah so I on an elevator on the job i
saw this on my wow that is sick

1466
01:19:58,110 --> 01:20:01,250
that's thumbprint contactless smartcard

1467
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:05,090
pin and it's got at the OK 1

1468
01:20:05,090 --> 01:20:08,620
yeah and and just so you're clear right

1469
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:12,630
is on fire service right now right guess
where this was the airport

1470
01:20:12,630 --> 01:20:16,550
the airport and connected and secure
area in sterile area

1471
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:20,310
yeah so the idea I'll flipping the fire
service mode

1472
01:20:20,310 --> 01:20:25,180
and going up to the sterile now you know
you can do that as a security evaluators

1473
01:20:25,180 --> 01:20:29,580
are you can do that as an actual bad
actor and how we know it actually know

1474
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:32,730
who is doing what and this elevator if
there's no human it's not a security

1475
01:20:32,730 --> 01:20:34,400
guard it's not even a blue shirt

1476
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:37,790
10-cup TSA it's just an elevator being
trusted

1477
01:20:37,790 --> 01:20:41,340
to not run people up without the
credential by the credential is a

1478
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:43,360
thirteen dollar Keyon yday

1479
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:46,880
that's a problem and people ask him
later in the bar there been a whole

1480
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:49,830
there's a huge bank job there's a
diamond heist John Antwerp

1481
01:20:49,830 --> 01:20:54,250
and ball leveraging the elevators sure
to ask about crazy elevator stories that

1482
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:55,450
we didn't have time for here

1483
01:20:55,450 --> 01:20:59,530
so in the end what does this mean for
you it means two things:

1484
01:20:59,530 --> 01:21:03,980
it means if you are worried about
security there are regular part so angry

1485
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:04,640
stacks

1486
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:08,390
and then there are proper elevator
security consultants

1487
01:21:08,390 --> 01:21:09,850
that is not your average

1488
01:21:09,850 --> 01:21:13,570
attack that is someone who is way cooler
and women are hopeful

1489
01:21:13,570 --> 01:21:18,640
the yeah Murr trapped if you're not a
building owner but you just want to make

1490
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:19,960
sure things go alright

1491
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:23,230
if you are stuck follow the following
steps:

1492
01:21:23,230 --> 01:21:27,350
and you'll probably be by even writing
down think I'm over watch the video

1493
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:27,830
later

1494
01:21:27,830 --> 01:21:33,150
first evolved all add you are on a good
run the air

1495
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:37,940
on a Hebrew 100 no you're fine I know
you know maybe claustrophobic the owners

1496
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:41,480
fine don't panic and also don't press

1497
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:44,719
emergency call just yet walking the
track while

1498
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:48,239
when you press emergency call all the
time there's gonna be a procedure

1499
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:51,130
you know like a script like any call
centers in apollo they're gonna try to

1500
01:21:51,130 --> 01:21:51,750
talk through it

1501
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:55,159
they want to make sure you're not
actually just sitting there

1502
01:21:55,159 --> 01:21:58,219
and not actually track for the first
thing is you know they might ask

1503
01:21:58,219 --> 01:22:00,350
headlights on as the emergency light on

1504
01:22:00,350 --> 01:22:03,400
but the lights are off I mean you know
it's pretty obvious what app right

1505
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:07,060
power outages shut down most elevators
unless it's equipped with an emergency

1506
01:22:07,060 --> 01:22:07,900
generator

1507
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:11,969
or certain hydraulic but later on

1508
01:22:11,969 --> 01:22:17,230
you're either entrapped or something is
just Kalas issue try pressing door open

1509
01:22:17,230 --> 01:22:21,850
even sometimes you can be a restricted
for Park Press tore open the door stop

1510
01:22:21,850 --> 01:22:25,560
many times trappers lot of people don't
you know that another I think that's

1511
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:26,210
another hot

1512
01:22:26,210 --> 01:22:29,520
you can try you know when I get yourself
killed get on the elevator don't have a

1513
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:29,980
call

1514
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:34,070
park itself up because it's on down pick

1515
01:22:34,070 --> 01:22:37,070
you step in the others I have no demand

1516
01:22:37,070 --> 01:22:40,540
wall go back to my home floor upstairs
because I'm expecting people to come

1517
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:40,980
down

1518
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:44,699
you're inside it goes up unit door open
when you get to the floor

1519
01:22:44,699 --> 01:22:50,929
now your operation bad have try pressing
door closed and pressing toward

1520
01:22:50,929 --> 01:22:55,199
sometimes the door just simply close
prop owners not only the floor

1521
01:22:55,199 --> 01:22:59,110
inside or on the outside or closed

1522
01:22:59,110 --> 01:23:01,900
that's when it's like try placing call

1523
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:06,180
according to lobby under strict justice
in every damn we're not gonna mine

1524
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:09,930
yourself and you know it has got a bad
system like here

1525
01:23:09,930 --> 01:23:13,920
try to imagine try police were called
again everybody him

1526
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:18,760
up a lot of time got this far this isn't
even work but it got keys

1527

know mickey's you need them

1528
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:26,930
yeah lol and then of course against the
to the fact that

1529
01:23:26,930 --> 01:23:31,420
cab doors to be closed or phenomena run
most stores are

1530
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:34,850

circular capitol grounds

1531
01:23:34,850 --> 01:23:38,330
doors but most are flat on his back how
to put your

1532
01:23:38,330 --> 01:23:42,320
flat in your palm on Braddock on the
middle of it or not near the not near

1533
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:42,880
the gap

1534
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:47,030
you know not near the edge adored I just
keep it moving around a little bit

1535
01:23:47,030 --> 01:23:51,550
know a lot of times and you actually
wide close maybe it was just 95 percent

1536
01:23:51,550 --> 01:23:52,430
closings close

1537
01:23:52,430 --> 01:23:56,740
not lock you know drop in switch didn't
pick up that's another way sometimes I

1538
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:57,670
like to get you going

1539
01:23:57,670 --> 01:24:01,570
mean something wrong or yeah and then
you'll

1540
01:24:01,570 --> 01:24:06,050
if you're still flock about yes when you
try to get out

1541
01:24:06,050 --> 01:24:10,780
things never to do don't go through that
stood atop actually in the movies

1542
01:24:10,780 --> 01:24:14,250
usually it can be locked me outside or
lost your other things up

1543
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:18,180
in all trip another center this is not
that circuit broken I can't move the

1544
01:24:18,180 --> 01:24:20,210
owners trying to move right there
contact

1545
01:24:20,210 --> 01:24:23,990
