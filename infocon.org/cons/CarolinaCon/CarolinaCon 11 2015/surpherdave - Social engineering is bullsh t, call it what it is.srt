1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:06,060
this talk um means worker working one
day and he saying that there is not

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:06,319
enough

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,920
speakers for Carolina con and I got home
that night person at this land on a

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,240
bunch Berman's and say

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,299
I could come up with the talk radio and
I did and there it is

6
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:20,939
and then I put an abstract in and I holy
forgot about all of the emails actually

7
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:23,680
to figure out what I suppose to talk
about so this is that talk

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,960
and is probably one of the most
difficult ones I've ever done because

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,550
I've the

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:31,220
research that went into it so hopefully
everyone enjoys it

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,910
the disclaimer This talk I'll

12
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,820
this is my opinions my opinions only and
all represent my company

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,980
and much like the Titleist talk
citations are needed

14
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:46,440
and I've tried my best to keep all the
citations in my notes

15
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,219
and as well as a reference light at the
end for anyone that wants to do

16
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:51,280
additional research

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,300
and this is on slideshares well I up
later this morning so if anyone want to

18
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:55,890
copy

19
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,090
it'll be on the under a slight

20
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,440
year alright so

21
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,040
typical fashion this talk might contain
you know triggers

22
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,040
and you know this is a trigger home and
gonna go up while

23
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,840
the hallway state Fish and I'll the
typical stuff the GC in the subset ox

24
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,030
so of course is Carolina con so it's
always a drinking contest

25
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,110
for any talk so 10 my old favorites a
few

26
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,140
a here see a this particular term from a
while back and I can't say

27
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,509
given one excuse or a buncha see words

28
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:34,430
a anywhere littered throughout talks
take a drink

29
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:38,689
of anyone's bringing I'll the gloom and
doom that

30
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:41,850
this is the end of the world bigotry
because

31
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,920
as much as we want to be the end of the
world chances are

32
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,930
the world will continue to go the spy

33
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:51,950
all the different reaches and things
like that

34
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,979
so about me um

35
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:58,250
I thought well who better to introduce
myself to myself

36
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,329
so this isn't fourteen-year-old Dave a

37
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:07,350
you an introduction here

38
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,460
so we had a

39
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,230
we doing what are you doing were
recording okay

40
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,630
Les Mis date my alias name

41
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:19,720
anarchist hurry for

42
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,410
the a

43
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,720
yeah I gotta love it here 14 years old
he get

44
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,820
on a BBS you get some recipes and

45
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,490
I proceed to go and build from exposes
after this I figured we don't need any

46
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,209
more ammo for any %uh the

47
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:40,709
three-letter agencies a so cut it off it
here

48
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:47,709
so let's jump right in this

49
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,880
old

50
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,209
know what more

51
00:02:55,209 --> 00:03:00,250
shape your social engineering right-wing
social engineering. social engineer

52
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,330
games so what social engineering social
and

53
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,650
social engineer of games social
engineering socially engineered

54
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,030
base is bullshit

55
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,420
alright so there's

56
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,780
there's someth references in there too
and obviously most everyone hears

57
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,640
for as coming up in speaking is all
great if you're not familiar with that

58
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,180
name

59
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,549
or that comedy sketch take 10 minutes
during a break in watching on YouTube

60
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:27,940
its

61
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,060
pretty hilarious and give some context
this to you some other things you'll see

62
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:39,060
the rest the weekend here so wanna go
ahead and

63
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:43,280
a actually slips miss to sleep here

64
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,370
yeah I want to go ahead and define what
social an engineer actually me

65
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,640
the actual words because I think that
we're kinda

66
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,730
using terms incorrectly a

67
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:58,489
as far as relating to everybody a in the
world we talk about being social

68
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:01,860
we talk about were related activities
really enjoy spending time with

69
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,410
five different locks locks workers here
too you know and thats

70
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:09,690
generally be some some pretty fun people
hanging on lockpick village

71
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:14,880
and also caught people %uh the last one
night maybe not so much

72
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,209
relating to people our society in
general we tend to kinda

73
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:22,049
be a fail at that you know we don't
relate to everybody but

74
00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:28,490
we got two or three definitions correct
a definition of an engineer

75
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,950
and has always bothered me because I've
been a Microsoft Certified Systems

76
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,010
Engineer for

77
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:37,790
like fourteen years or something like
that that I gotta engineering school

78
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:42,470
i'd engineering school for engineers are
technically a person no scientific

79
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,720
training and build complicated products
machines

80
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,120
eccentric center by the way that
pictures like the hardest thing I've

81
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,210
ever found on the internet for this talk
is because the internet doesn't think

82
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,560
that women can be engineers

83
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,080
they think that you know they to dress
up as engineers

84
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,340
in costume so actually this is a an
engineer working at oil refinery

85
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:04,370
so engineers also person it's a charger
running a ship like

86
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,340
like these two gentlemen or person that
runs the tree

87
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:15,340
liked this guy so the the term
engineering is actually

88
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,010
applying science love all these
different things

89
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,780
like physics and chemistry mathematics
it's a special

90
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:28,470
knowledge associated with so you have
mechanical engineering and architecture

91
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,530
engineering and I don't even know what
you'd call

92
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,550
the large collider engineering I mean
that's that's really what an engine

93
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,540
areas it's a it's a specific scientific
practice

94
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,550
I'll by a person that actually has a
degree or some type of

95
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:46,390
I'll PhD in engineers so I think it's a
misnomer that we call

96
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:50,520
people engineers I mean I'm technically
an information security engineer but I

97
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,490
don't have a degree here

98
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,740
in engineering so we we turn to throw
that term around quite a bit

99
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,110
so it's up calling it

100
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,200
social engineering let's call it what it
really is its manipulation

101
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,090
so how do we apply manipulation in
information security

102
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:10,360
well we do it through phishing emails
and things like that we do it through

103
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,140
phone calls we index there's various
different

104
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,310
type server phone scams and things like
that

105
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,120
one is up

106
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,639
called fishing where year actually talk
to the person out other information

107
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,910
arse mission which you use answer
shortcode messages are

108
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:30,360
MMS on the phones to check somebody out
information

109
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,290
dumpster diving you're looking for
information about a person so that you

110
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,690
can manipulate them further

111
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:39,810
doc saying which your finding
information about the person in

112
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,740
openly disclosing to embarrass the
person or to further a

113
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,770
attack an open source intelligence I
apologize that is kind of a smattering

114
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:49,250
of

115
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:53,680
a different things there if anyone
familiar with the tool multi go it's

116
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,500
great for open source intelligence

117
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,690
but it's great for also fighting
manipulating people

118
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:03,530
a based on companies organizations
persons and so on so forth

119
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,370
but this isn't a technical talk this is
a a talk about people

120
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,729
so with just dive in real quick

121
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:16,810
into the history of manipulation and
deception now

122
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:21,740
the Bible take it or leave it however
you feel about the Bible with the story

123
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,580
about how to me this probably there

124
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:28,520
the first one the first recorded a event
so

125
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,599
manipulation inception it's quickly to
recap

126
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,650
what happened there a Adam was put on
the earth by God

127
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,950
God said hey I need cheater I'm gonna

128
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:42,560
create a companion for you you guys are
gonna be prosperous feel the earth

129
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,770
make a garden and you're gonna serve me
another angel saw this became

130
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:50,539
NBS at this said I can turn them away
I'll

131
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:55,150
talk to Eve Eve said if you eat this
fruit you can

132
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,240
be like me a Logan bad annually God

133
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,289
and therefore their outcast from the
garden because love

134
00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:07,419
manipulation and the section on the part
that Angel fault weights

135
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:11,160
in nature market place's is a common
practice to

136
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,449
a switch the weight you have an official
weight set up

137
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:18,160
by the tax collectors up for the the
area

138
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,710
and the the merchants that I oftentimes
switchers wait so you think you're

139
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,460
buying a unit of grain

140
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,720
when in fact you might be paying for
only three quarters love you

141
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,780
degree and deceiving people there
clothing makeup and smells ur

142
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,969
also a type a perception that have been
used for

143
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:39,260
many millennia I'll well maybe not

144
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,890
that long but any later archaeological
evidence shows that our ancestors

145
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,340
used to OCR which is a reddish powder

146
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,610
and the reason it's done that and it
happens today the reason I was done that

147
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,880
it's a simulate the time that a woman is

148
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,250
ovulating and this is to attract the
mail so we we

149
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,120
carry some of these practices today we
might not even realize it I'll

150
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,690
well egyptian women used to Green paced

151
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:08,570
like a car like modern-day eyeshadow you
see here cleopatra

152
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:14,370
a in the movie there these wigs and
things like that to accentuate the eyes

153
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:18,190
to exaggerate their the Fallis up their
lips

154
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,590
a Greek and Roman times the women would
either hair blonde

155
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:25,430
apply makeup to cover blemishes in like
their skin

156
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:29,310
a and use polish to remove unwanted body
here

157
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,860
all these things are obviously for

158
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,920
a deception and in the for attracting
another person

159
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,630
so for a young age

160
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,900
we are taught to be a deceptive to
people

161
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:48,110
any that you only think about it that
way because it's you talk to people I

162
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:51,460
your tot if you go to a place up

163
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,790
you know your grandparents house and you
said on Graham grandfather's lap his

164
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,830
brothers horrible

165
00:09:55,830 --> 00:10:00,200
you're told that this that same thing
because you not to say anything bad

166
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,630
and less well never really to be polite

167
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:07,680
but you know if you got it this guy here
obviously

168
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,030
you thinking to yourself this guy
doesn't really quite fit in here but

169
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:14,280
are you gonna be the one to go up and
tell him that that's not appropriate in

170
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,690
our culture probably not now in Asian
culture

171
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,750
you see this in films all the time and I
don't think it's a problem

172
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,839
here to a little differently we've been
we've been taught from

173
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,210
a a young age to be respectful and

174
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:31,210
and and watching a person's feeling so
weak always telling ourselves

175
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:33,800
telling people white lies about

176
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,130
how we really feel now

177
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,860
Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny I don't
want to get out too far down that hall

178
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,990
there but to

179
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:46,100
we've been deceiving ourselves are our
children for a long time with these

180
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,570
with these myths they they're based in
pagan

181
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:52,829
teachings and we brought them into
Christianity a

182
00:10:52,829 --> 00:10:56,260
the history of Christmas and actually a
Easter

183
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:00,600
a when constantine decided that

184
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,760
he has all these Christians that he's
conquered and he's got always pagans in

185
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,880
this huge empire

186
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,930
how do we get everybody to cooperate
with each other the Christians wanna

187
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,779
practice their things and paying for
practice or think well it is marymount

188
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:13,339
together

189
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,570
so we have Saturnalia which is the the
festival

190
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:20,399
and where time love the winter solstice
which corresponds

191
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,640
around December 20th and we have

192
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,399
the winner %uh the summer the
SpringSource this would happen actually

193
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,019
yesterday the first day of spring

194
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:31,019
and that his coincides with the

195
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:35,190
Easter are around that time so

196
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,839
this picture here's that have ODN and

197
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:42,450
where we get a lot of the stuff from
Santa Claus from

198
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:46,560
dramatic up traditions and from Norse
traditions

199
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,450
so the god Odin um at your time voting
would actually go on a hunting party

200
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:56,170
and he would take 8 reindeer and fly to
the sky

201
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:59,779
hunting party so we kind of adopted that
park

202
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:03,120
there's another pagan deity a the fauna

203
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,420
was a Roman goddess that was a gift
giver the Holly King was a cell

204
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,480
Celtic wilder when you're gone all these
guys

205
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,579
for formed the basis of Santa Claus in
the the gift giving and things like that

206
00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:19,329
Easter I'm comes from

207
00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:22,750
the up the goddess

208
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,500
L'Estrange I or all-star and

209
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,870
her rollin Easter was the she was
thought to be the divinity

210
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:34,459
you was that the radiant dawn the
returning flight

211
00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:38,920
are the one that brings joy and blessing
so it was pretty easy to adopt that too

212
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,830
that

213
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:44,060
of a the traditions of the Easter Bunny
she also represented

214
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,510
a the the goddess sure the goddess of
fertility as well

215
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:52,200
see at the Easter Bunny's you have
checks and things like that all these

216
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,990
animals are quickly producers so they
were celebrated for

217
00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:00,580
their ability to reproduce quickly and
therefore it was a

218
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:07,470
symbol of procreation another we got
from

219
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:12,050
basic issue about manipulation and
deception let's go into some other

220
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,550
techniques that actually work

221
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,910
um the first one is the ruler
reciprocity

222
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:20,250
recall the golden rule you do unto
others as they would

223
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,700
have them are as you would have them do
unto you and in doing so

224
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,960
I'll the the room the exchange

225
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,220
is usually on it even level now the
example

226
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:35,370
love the hairy Krishna it is summer
people are familiar with the hairy

227
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,840
Christian is at the scene them in public
spaces there

228
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,240
I'll their practicing their religion

229
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,700
but one thing they figured out as the
ruler reciprocity

230
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,460
was works to their advantage and what
they would do if they would come up to

231
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,060
people

232
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,170
and say train station or our bus stop or
something like that

233
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:57,400
and they would hand a person a single
flower and that person's level

234
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,240
I don't I never get anything for free
why this person give me a flower

235
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,010
and they gotta hand it back and they say
no no it's a gift from the rechristened

236
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:10,010
but if you'd like accept the donation
from to the rule reciprocity it's

237
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,430
ingrained in us so we receive something
free

238
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:15,940
then you know mentally thinking me and I

239
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,790
I feel kinda guilty one receiving this I
should probably give a donation

240
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,560
now obviously this is something that has
happened

241
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,350
a long time ago this is more popular in
the late seventies

242
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:31,440
eighties a so that people kinda adapted
to that type thing

243
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,010
you can ever are wary of anybody that
approaches you know we've all changed

244
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:42,010
our methods because I've what they've
done

245
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,580
L street performers

246
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:50,310
I was in Nam actually and Jackson Square
known for

247
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:54,320
a a conference one time and I saw these
guys going to breakdance

248
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,360
is really cool I really had a good time
watching over

249
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,510
big family that or the way they had it
set up as the had all these guys are

250
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,550
stripper 401 gotta stay in office I with
the bucket

251
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:08,060
for money well the guy next to him was

252
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,920
also with or in on it and he start
pouring money into the bucket

253
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,800
and then the guy rapidly goes around the
circle and and accepts donations from

254
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,430
everybody

255
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:20,770
he thought it these guys they're really
good job I really should give them

256
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:21,880
something there

257
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,530
there in this case it's it's a
legitimate thing it's a I

258
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:28,900
you enjoyed it so you you give a little
money so they can continue their

259
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:33,190
their practice now

260
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:38,190
free samples is also a great way to you
sales technique that

261
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:41,700
actually works for reciprocation in

262
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:46,210
that's not the Costco typist love a free
sample or you're facing a person

263
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:49,870
that that's a little awkward sometimes
you're easily able to just take

264
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:54,140
you know whatever and walk away and not
have to do it um

265
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,270
when I was doing the research for this
talk it brought me to something I used

266
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:57,580
to

267
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,580
take people to when I lived near New
York avances

268
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:04,680
all of our up on the Upper West Side and
the cool thing about this and you never

269
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,140
get anything free in your

270
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:10,360
except for this all of our is your
allowed to walk in that all of our

271
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,310
and this is not the exact picture but
there's like 50 some barrels of

272
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,880
different all around the world

273
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,950
allowed to eat as many hours as you
wanted to while you're in the store

274
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:24,320
which is was just pretty colleagues
think well you get something for free

275
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,750
well what happened was like nine times
out of ten I had people from outta town

276
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,480
their float they flew in

277
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,580
they're staying in a hotel or their
driving back or something items are 10

278
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,730
they were buying

279
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:38,740
a lot of olives work not like we're
driving around New York were

280
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,510
hollings olive all over New York on the
subways everything else

281
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:46,070
so it works I mean these guys got to eat
some stuff for free

282
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:50,630
bought a bunch hours and i'd never
understood really how that worked until

283
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,779
and doing some research for this talk as
to why that way

284
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:57,209
worked because they receive something
for free

285
00:16:57,209 --> 00:17:02,709
they felt the need to reciprocate their
I'm gonna lock

286
00:17:02,709 --> 00:17:06,449
show guys are here this story is a true
story

287
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:09,689
I will not name names and and it was
handed down

288
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:14,679
like a he with telephone to me so I
might get some other details wrong

289
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:18,829
anyhow the story goes as i recall it

290
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:22,209
in I might recall incorrectly worker

291
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:25,549
on pure to me don't do it in a minute up

292
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:28,620
as is the story was related to me I

293
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,510
you have a a guy in a girl and the girl

294
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,730
is very friendly very open very flirty
very

295
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,320
a come onto just about everybody that
she needs

296
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,740
the guy says well K we're going to go to
Vegas

297
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,809
and wanna come with me and your room

298
00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:49,360
all I can stop structure totally love to
go do that

299
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,730
sounds awesome so they go to Vegas and
what happens

300
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:56,270
is you know there's there's one frame
her

301
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:59,260
above mine there that what's this girl
gonna do obviously they're going

302
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,370
together this

303
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:03,809
but seems to be some type a romantic
relationship and typically when you take

304
00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:06,419
somebody on vacation what you expect to
happen

305
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,669
something romantic especially if you're
sharing a room together

306
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:13,500
it was the complete opposite it did not
work at all

307
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,419
fell apart she did not have any
expectations are that she iz was

308
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:18,169
socially

309
00:18:18,169 --> 00:18:22,409
different and the fact that she did not
realize what she was doing

310
00:18:22,409 --> 00:18:25,659
could could be conveyed differently so
in this type of

311
00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:29,200
scenario where traditional

312
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,720
um the way traditional relationships
work

313
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,480
the reciprocity was fail even though
that

314
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,330
expectations that need to be there um in
that

315
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:44,870
they're worse a some differences are how
things work now you have an entire group

316
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:45,530
of guys

317
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:49,230
the back his their friend that's a she's
completely

318
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:54,280
you know tease in the girl with all our
friends like I have no idea why they all

319
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:54,799
hate me

320
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,980
so there's definitely some the and
that's an example of

321
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,090
reciprocation

322
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:03,150
is a failure in a can cause us socially
cause

323
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:09,450
up quite extreme the next technique is a
contender

324
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,980
commitment and consistency now if you
got a racetrack in you

325
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,610
you watch people they look at the board
to look at the odds are the horses and

326
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:19,980
what the horses are you know or their
chances of winning are

327
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:25,169
in a racetrack better will go up and put
money down a specific course

328
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:28,429
and they once a up

329
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:31,590
bet on that horse now they've committed
themselves to that

330
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:36,630
course so to stay consistent they
continually bet on that horse

331
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,700
over and over and over again because now
they put money down

332
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:44,730
they've actually put dollars and they
wanna stay consistent now give me

333
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,510
another example I want to downplay
anything

334
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:52,630
about abused spouses and you know it we
tend to think that women get abused but

335
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:53,730
this is actually in

336
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:57,370
wasn't on purpose that we have a friend
from Australia here but

337
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:01,460
this this is actually public service
announcement from Australia

338
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:05,500
in what I wanted the story behind that I
wanted to tell about commitment and

339
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,740
consistency there

340
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:11,620
you have a a guy and a girl i Mary they
live together live together for a long

341
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,000
time the guy

342
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,970
is a is a drunkie drinks a lot he not
necessarily

343
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,539
abusive but that's not really what a
girl wants huge the girl wants to get

344
00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:22,260
married what some stop drinking

345
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:27,929
you know that's it to traditional type a
story so what happens the growth but up

346
00:20:27,929 --> 00:20:28,669
she's done

347
00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:31,279
he doesn't want to change he says I'm
not gonna change we're gonna change

348
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:32,539
fishy leave

349
00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:35,649
she finds another guy you know in they

350
00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:39,399
end up together an end up getting an
engagement and everything seems to be

351
00:20:39,399 --> 00:20:40,419
going well former

352
00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:44,309
for her but the guys like a culture up

353
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:47,330
you know what I'm really want to get
back with you

354
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:51,100
change her ways I'm not gonna drink
anymore we're gonna get married within a

355
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,669
few months after you come back

356
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:56,429
what did she do she thinks back on all
the good times ahead

357
00:20:56,429 --> 00:21:00,279
and she breaks of this relationship
because that's what she really wanted in

358
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:01,710
the first place is this guy

359
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:08,390
that to make those changes what happened
she moved back in

360
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:12,710
few weeks go by start drinking again few
years go by

361
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:16,100
they're still not married but what
happens in this case

362
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,530
because she has committed

363
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:22,760
to moving back in and pushing out a

364
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,920
hurt her changed ways now she has up

365
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,960
now she has aligned herself with being
with this guy

366
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,980
and now she has to stay consistent in
your own mind

367
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:37,160
the keeper from going insane the now
she's gone back and now she second exact

368
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,140
same relationship

369
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,440
but she loves him more now than she did
before she left

370
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:47,450
another way the commitment and
consistency works in

371
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:51,970
in the tag the toy industry's pretty
good about using this technique I know

372
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:54,210
growing up and I i've never celebrated
Christmas

373
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:57,870
myself but I knew in December than that
was written all the cool games are

374
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:00,820
coming out the core console and stuff
like that we're coming out

375
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,030
and so I always wanted you know was
coming out in December

376
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:09,300
well the toy companies couldn't figure
out how to keep their sales up

377
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:13,030
after Christmas obviously christmastime
the fourth quarter was their big rush on

378
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:13,580
sale

379
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,980
on on toy sales the third up

380
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,790
they knew people would be um

381
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:24,160
wanna keep your promises to their
children so what would they do they

382
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,270
advertise advertise advertise this is
the new talking robot the peas and

383
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:31,070
groups and all this other stuff for this
is the new game console

384
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:34,270
and the kids like that all I want for
Christmas I want

385
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:37,470
parents like absolutely that's what
you're getting for Christmas

386
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:41,240
and down I promise achieve what happens

387
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,850
that toy it doesn't exist other than a
few people they're able to get it in a

388
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:46,510
mad rush

389
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:50,380
at up department store but what happens
after

390
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:54,440
the new year goes around seemingly
truckloads at the same toy

391
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:59,460
go on the shelves and now the pair field
obligated despite buying toys for the

392
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:03,480
the child during Christmas time now the
parent because he promised that

393
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,100
that child few that he would have that
toy he goes and actually spend some

394
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:08,600
money

395
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,190
to buy that toy after Christmas why

396
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:17,680
because he committed to that child and
if he doesn't say consistent then how is

397
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,000
he ever gonna teach that child

398
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,970
that

399
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:23,090
let your yes mean yessir keep your
promises don't break your work

400
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:26,850
because East he did that I mean that the
toy industry's pretty genius when it

401
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:29,310
comes to that figure that type stuff out

402
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:32,800
okay

403
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:38,950
sorry for some reason the alcoholic
drink I say maybe 100

404
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:43,040
up pacing and matching

405
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,420
so we're gonna we're gonna switch gears
in when honestly switch gears where talk

406
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:46,970
about

407
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:51,050
near linguistic programming now what are
friends came up to me last night I was

408
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:51,970
talking about

409
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:55,550
you know this this talk and a he asked
me if i tre

410
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:58,900
seen CSI seaward a

411
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:03,950
evidently I guess they're they're
starting to here

412
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:07,770
you doing I'm not drinkin have so
evidently they started bringing in from

413
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:08,630
any such a

414
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:12,310
techniques that i'm gonna talk about
here but no I don't watch that showed

415
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:15,330
I don't think have a TV i download stuff
off the internet

416
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:18,820
completely legal of the Internet you but
a

417
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:23,820
so we're gonna go over a few these
things and it really does tie into us

418
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,170
I'll working with people and and
building

419
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:31,620
relationships but also identifying when
someone is taking advantage of us

420
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:36,600
so the first technique is called pacing
and matching it's similar method acting

421
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,490
here got tied up talking about

422
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:41,580
I'm if you're not putting a certain
amount yourself

423
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,790
into acting then you actually lie

424
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:48,420
and that's similar to pacing in matching
what that means is it's it's not

425
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,300
mirroring

426
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:52,410
as what for talk about that Nexus not
tonight del

427
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:56,590
identical representation if someone
crosses her arms the sitter

428
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:59,690
cross your arms someone touches their
faces occur and cross your face you

429
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:00,660
don't do that because

430
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:04,250
if you're starting off doing these types
of things it can be

431
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,740
really noticeable really obvious that
that's what you're doing and some people

432
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,600
will see that now take it as that

433
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,230
that you're trying to take advantage so
what you do is you mimic

434
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:16,470
um somebody's body language and speech

435
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:19,730
in order to build that report know what
I mean is

436
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:23,230
if somebody is has a a comfortable

437
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:27,140
stance then you can take a comfortable
stance as well if they're more rigid

438
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:30,360
when you take a more rigid stance how is
somebody is

439
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:35,050
s in a conversation with another person
and their feet are straightforward

440
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:39,440
then you know that that conversation is
closed if there's any more open

441
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,660
you know that that opening that you can
approach see your

442
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:46,930
your your your pacing in your matching
that person you're integrating lol euro

443
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:51,650
so you have this actor here that has all
these different elements you can tell

444
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,730
from his facial expressions which will
get into

445
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:59,200
further that you know kind of what the
person's feeling no

446
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,370
your really you bring your vocabulary
vocabulary in line with the person now

447
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,710
this country girl here

448
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:09,100
you're probably not gonna go to parents
are talking about stuff like when you

449
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,230
lived in New York City

450
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:13,830
are using the that accent from there are
from Wisconsin

451
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:17,270
because she's probably not gonna catch a
fish was probably from this area here

452
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,680
she's gonna lose a lot of that

453
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,320
in that world especially if you have
someone like this

454
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,440
you know well I don't even know how to
describe the vocabulary is there but

455
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:33,440
you have to bring or why would you even
talk to that person but um

456
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:39,200
but you know you bring your your
vocabulary line with the person we're

457
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,300
gonna talk about a little bit further
but basically you're not going to use

458
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:46,360
words that are gonna make the other
person feel uncomfortable um

459
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,590
if obviously if the person has and
graduated high school

460
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:54,250
iraqis college-level a words and things
like that and make them feel

461
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:54,960
uncomfortable

462
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,690
now there's several different types and
you're only talk about nearing

463
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:06,570
behavior marion is a for example that
and this is how this works is that many

464
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:07,270
men

465
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:10,420
don't realize it combo with a stick with
a woman

466
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:14,190
they'll bring their picked up a little
bit it's a it's kind of a natural thing

467
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:14,950
because

468
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:18,320
a survivalist be she says that we need
to actually

469
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,680
cooperate and reproduce and things like
that you know dragging a woman out by

470
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,980
her hair out at the cave

471
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:27,200
was ineffective for generations so

472
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,200
obviously the report between man-woman

473
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,560
to keepers the species going

474
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,770
had to change show men tend to mir women

475
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:40,710
a in order for them you know but we all
know how the story goes there

476
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:44,210
anyway if you're up nevermind away

477
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:48,020
to keep this is PC is possible got sick

478
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:51,860
are help wardrobe this is symbolic
nearing

479
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:55,390
and he's Martinique fly I didn't
actually have this costume

480
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:59,760
but so the story that I thought of what
I thought it think symbolic hearing is

481
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,250
that a

482
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:03,419
wardrobe and when I move to Texas I

483
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:06,659
a became working actor working for

484
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:11,399
organization local county governments
actually talked about that last year

485
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:14,970
a little bit ly talk then but these guys
were all X

486
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:19,090
officials from local government a you
got judges in

487
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:23,190
and commissioners and sheriffs and
things like that these guys are

488
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:26,559
in Texas is the Wild West at no doubt

489
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,700
I mean if you think any differently
please go to Texas and check it out

490
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,539
because it is

491
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:34,429
still crazy out there we start counties
out there that we're doing things

492
00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:37,429
over general ledger did not even have
computers

493
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:40,649
it was crazy but anyway so so I found
that

494
00:28:40,649 --> 00:28:44,840
going to visit these counties and you
know me I Drive all hippie van died

495
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,159
right address like this

496
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,220
got all you know Volkswagen there and

497
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:53,360
I found that showing up for appointments
and wearing what I'm wearing now

498
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,919
didn't enter well with a lot of the guys
there

499
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:59,970
so what did I do actually did get a hat

500
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:05,029
got some boots and some Wranglers and 10
in showed up

501
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:10,490
guess what now is received as one of
their their own so you can Sabah likely

502
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:11,440
mirror person

503
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,309
in that way another I'd another way

504
00:29:15,309 --> 00:29:18,480
that you can use symbolic nearing is in
writing

505
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,980
up if you're a liberal person

506
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:26,149
and you're trying to express your views
to a conservative ideas audience

507
00:29:26,149 --> 00:29:30,590
you don't want to speak like a liberal
doesn't work

508
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:33,600
rather the so there's an example if a
guy that

509
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,070
actually wrote a piece as a liberal
about cuban fidel castro

510
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,360
but he did it in such a way to a

511
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,250
speak to conserve is about that though
how do you do it he is conservative

512
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,260
language

513
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:49,610
all of us have our different language
base I mean its computer security we all

514
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:50,160
know

515
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,260
generally overall talking about we come
to this conference is

516
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:57,400
conservatives and liberals all speak
differently as well he was able to pin

517
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,470
his liberal

518
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:01,480
um argument in a way that

519
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,790
in conservative a vocabulary and
language

520
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:07,890
actually enraged some liberals they
didn't

521
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:11,230
look at the underlying message here like
you're being a a conservative what

522
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:11,790
happen

523
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:15,160
but did you actually read it now it's
because they're using issues using the

524
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,420
same vocabulary

525
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:21,540
and symbolically mirroring the way that
republicans or conservatives

526
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:28,330
would actually write an article exchange
matches

527
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:32,440
is not necessarily a exactly me ring but
its substituting

528
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,440
one part of the body for another like
the example I like is that a

529
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,830
reading which is that the technique
that's very difficult to achieve the

530
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:40,840
someone's breathing

531
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,860
any you're watching them their chest
rise and fall

532
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:49,010
you can actually switch out with your
hand

533
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:52,700
he could tap you can tap your side I'll

534
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:56,270
and this will actually allow you to come
to get in sync with

535
00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:00,660
what how they're breathing I without
them actually know what you doing or

536
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,460
tapping your foot are however out

537
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:06,300
sure you're substituting party your body
for another so you not necessarily

538
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:10,620
up being very obvious the way that
you're nearing the person this is a lot

539
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,940
more disarming ended

540
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:16,130
has to work in and not get you caught
doing an exact

541
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:20,330
a Mary now perfect example using hence
the control

542
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:24,270
breathing a are how mirroring works
effectively

543
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:27,370
if you ever got to somebody that's super
upset or angry

544
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:29,990
the first thing you do is like calm down

545
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:34,130
law homegirl right what does that do

546
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:37,420
your hands or a

547
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:41,080
mirroring there what you want their
breathing to be

548
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:45,150
see you're bringing them back down again
back down so you can use your hands

549
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,640
there I don't think that's what the
president

550
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:51,390
going there but I figured I put a bunch
presidential flight as well

551
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:56,970
so another part of neuro-linguistic
programming is building and maintaining

552
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:58,429
report when people

553
00:31:58,429 --> 00:32:03,700
now showing interest in a person and get
this guy here

554
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:07,210
I think I was that guy at some point I

555
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:12,120
actually still have but he said he's at
this party is a shy guy

556
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,450
and what would you think would happen if
these two girls in the back to go

557
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:19,440
are talking to it for about I mean
probably

558
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,920
this run away and hide so showing up
interest in a person doesn't necessarily

559
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,929
bill report

560
00:32:24,929 --> 00:32:28,590
it's a positive connection just like me
i i

561
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:31,910
I speak from my heart my vision and a
lot of times and

562
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:35,340
you sometimes I come across like that

563
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:39,140
isn't speaking what I feel and of course
we got a lot of

564
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:42,480
sarcasm and cynicism in this audience so
if you guys are

565
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,600
saying this guy's a tool that's fine I
don't care doesn't

566
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,830
doesn't bother me a bit but because this
guy is so obnoxious and

567
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:53,240
so I in your face my guy was

568
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,400
wrong with this guy and you can't over
poor that way either

569
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,980
so century

570
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:03,760
acuity is it as the technique and that
we already have

571
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,850
some grasp on up subconsciously

572
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:09,820
see you're looking at a person you're
trying to figure out this guy here he's

573
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,960
got all these different

574
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,309
things about him that you try to figure
out um

575
00:33:14,309 --> 00:33:18,640
so you start the start of by within this
is a skill that has to be built upon you

576
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,550
start off by noting

577
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:23,200
certainly wants is about people and as
humans we automatically

578
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,200
bill as we build relationships we
automatically do these things so we can

579
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,500
a in common ground but

580
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,840
how many people here and actually walk
into a room

581
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,380
not knowing anything about eight people
in a room in a

582
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,990
for somebody in that room makes them
makes you immediately on cover

583
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:44,690
more I know it's when I enter the room
everyone else is uncomfortable

584
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:48,070
so ever you don't understand why

585
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:51,190
you feel uncomfortable chin up quite
sure why

586
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:56,050
sensory acuity were actually find out
why on that person's telegraphing

587
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,690
something that bothers you

588
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:01,600
so as you learn to look at so many
things that we're going to talk about

589
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,790
you can actually pick up on summer those
vibes from others

590
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:09,360
things have been telegraphed his to why
that person creeps you out

591
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:13,700
well good cardiologists I will tell you
when they start listening to people's

592
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,230
hearts

593
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:18,020
the first thing next they heard was just
the basic lebed up to

594
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:22,669
but after a while they're able to pick
up on stuff like prolapse valves heart

595
00:34:22,669 --> 00:34:23,760
murmur so much more

596
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,690
nigger the doctor they don't listen I
just one spot heard all around the

597
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,270
question back and everything out that

598
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:34,010
a train here similar to censor cutie it
through practice you gonna start picking

599
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,389
up on things that

600
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:39,020
you you haven't done up until then

601
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:46,020
so speech other delay here

602
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:51,090
so some people

603
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:54,850
correlated they do this in the media lot
from what people say or PS a personal

604
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:55,440
question

605
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,109
and they can immediately think of an
answer and they're being accepted

606
00:34:59,109 --> 00:35:02,410
I say that uni practice a

607
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:05,570
to understand really what's going on I
give you an example a fast one did you

608
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,960
hear what you do in seven years ago
today

609
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,350
you can be like this guy have no idea

610
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:14,990
due in seven years old today are seven
years ago today

611
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:18,570
review hassle if they probable a
convenience store

612
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:22,480
seven years ago today there in serbia no

613
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,600
if they think too long and hard about it
maybe

614
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,830
they were knocking over a convenience
store 7

615
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:33,550
fears

616
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,380
I love that movie as your

617
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:39,660
so good re: um

618
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:43,930
the stress level %uh voice can really
show anxiety or catch in somebody off

619
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:44,490
guard

620
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:48,620
said yes someone a questionnaire you
find somebody a situation in the

621
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:49,760
immediately get

622
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,420
nervous dry mouth can show that

623
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:56,480
all that alcohol abuse eggs ideal or

624
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,050
submit you know public speaking is
obviously something that causes a lot of

625
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:00,970
people in society

626
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:05,800
myself his you know definitely the first
talk I think I've done so over

627
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,940
in a while which is good because
actually I could think through this

628
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,450
better

629
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:13,180
but UK you can tell that that the person

630
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:17,770
if they get dry mouth or if they are
third a sweater things like that you can

631
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:19,340
tell there's something wrong with it

632
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:24,420
with the what they're talking to you
about and then accelerated back to these

633
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:24,960
two

634
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:30,100
again because you can not only tell that
maybe she's from like North Carolina Air

635
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,529
are some like that and that she's from
whatever planet she's from

636
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:37,220
a also tell their educational level

637
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:42,970
if you're talking to somebody a I know
where I live outside outside a Gastonia

638
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:47,100
a near Charlotte um got a lot of
working-class people there

639
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:50,650
an autopen probably didn't finish high
school but when I go into

640
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:55,420
you know local establishments there I
don't use huge vocabulary words are

641
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:58,630
try make them feel uncomfortable because
I can tell

642
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:01,740
by there there a

643
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:05,260
their language the way they're speaking
to me

644
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:09,050
Intel I know how how far along the way
not that that's a bad thing

645
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:12,790
there there's no negative there but
you're able to pick up on those things

646
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:14,130
so that you don't slip up

647
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:17,460
when you're building report you're able
to understand

648
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,470
you know where that person is coming
from and therefore a

649
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,380
like we the term in

650
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,540
in and jujitsu is close that gap

651
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:28,690
to you want to try and close the gap
over that level there

652
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:32,500
a between two people so making your

653
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,860
you don't actually mean the cracks any
that pretty insulting

654
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:38,860
possibly racist so you want to be
careful about that

655
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:43,190
but you want to be able to you
understand that your speech makes a

656
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:43,790
difference

657
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:47,280
and it it'll actually help you close
that gap between

658
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,090
to people body language

659
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:55,560
it is interesting us stress levels can
change in an instant

660
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:00,340
um you can tell a lot about a person by
what it looks like

661
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:03,960
you know I was the well i think is face
a stock like this but

662
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,490
you can tell he's pretty upset about
something a

663
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:11,450
you know get the the Obamas here I know

664
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:15,370
want disgusted one surprised I guess a
year

665
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:20,130
like what's going on here I don't know
bollocks content in

666
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:23,680
show a shock when we're there and never
mind um

667
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,640
said the flight or fight response is
something that isn't great in all of us

668
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,670
and that is the sympathetic nervous
system

669
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:34,080
and read something that I mean you have
to be a train con man it's really

670
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,170
kinda cycle that often on because

671
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:41,200
something shocking happens or you become
like dead inside like

672
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,430
some people um you don't have that
problem but for the most most of us

673
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:48,720
something shocking happens or something
pleasing happens it's gonna show our

674
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,220
face

675
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:52,690
that's why poker games and things like
that people wear of stuff to

676
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:56,020
avoid a allowing people to see your eyes
because

677
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:59,530
I see people's eyes

678
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:03,810
and seeing what people do you can tell a
lot about what they're saying now

679
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:08,140
this picture here in the streets a
technique in the section

680
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:11,790
or under understanding someone's lying
to you called shielding

681
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:15,010
if someone puts ur and up when they're
you know

682
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:18,460
shamelle while there given our sponsor
they're kinda

683
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:22,360
looking around with the risers kinda
wondered around there

684
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,520
probably doing something this up to take
like

685
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,070
worker

686
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:31,440
but you know obviously Lance Armstrong
this is I think

687
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,710
a picture before he was actually confirm
that he was

688
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:39,990
using drugs and this was an interview I
think it felt by Southwest and they

689
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:41,190
often that question

690
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:45,540
or they write their car shows that he
was hiding something there

691
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:49,910
I'll another thing you can look at is
well we've all seen this guy I think on

692
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:50,610
the internet but

693
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:54,710
um the stuff or something wrong with
this guy a either you've cracked out or

694
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:55,590
something but

695
00:39:55,590 --> 00:40:00,510
um obviously this is an extreme case
because you're dealing with someone you

696
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:01,820
talk with somebody that's got

697
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:04,820
the pupils to dilate here they getting
lipson

698
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:08,170
inkatha get more reserved for backing
himself there

699
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:11,700
they're probably something wrong there's
there something that you've said to them

700
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:15,140
is in booking that flight or fight
response that

701
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:18,790
that you can pick up on actually is in
your

702
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:22,820
century a cutie calibration

703
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:26,090
is the understanding after the using a
fan /3

704
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:30,320
hearing your see we're building on East
on these things here sensor using sensor

705
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,360
cutie to gauge the state the person said

706
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,440
to go back to this this method actor
here

707
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,930
there's a lot of different expressions
on its face if you see somebody

708
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:42,270
a understand that their obviously
terrified

709
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:45,630
what you can what you do is you become

710
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:49,980
terrified yourself in and in a sense so
that you can bridge that gap between the

711
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:50,480
person

712
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,390
see recognize it any act upon it

713
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:58,140
so that when you approach the person you
wanna go to terrify person

714
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:01,630
hey how's it going no that's not gonna
work they're gonna

715
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:04,850
they're gonna be put off but if you come
up with that sympathetic

716
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:08,980
idea that they're terrified I know how
that feels

717
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:12,330
then you're able to to to bridge that
gap as well

718
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:15,690
so once you understand their state
you're able to cultivate that feeling

719
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:20,080
in yourself posture

720
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,820
another good way of doing things to cut

721
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:27,610
is the person and is to adopt the person
stands for sitting position

722
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:31,240
so that they feel comfortable with you
and

723
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,730
he goes from quite extremes here

724
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:39,160
eight what are those frames has a
different expression in a different way

725
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:39,410
of

726
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:39,859
a

727
00:41:39,859 --> 00:41:44,430
upsetting posture to being able to adapt
and understand the person's posture

728
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:49,630
I'll really is important in learning
about the person and and bridging that

729
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:50,349
gap again

730
00:41:50,349 --> 00:41:53,930
movement and we talk about but

731
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:57,660
gesturing how fast how slow how often
are open and close

732
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:00,809
I'm if a person is doing this

733
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:04,420
you're probably talking to you in New
York Italian up

734
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:07,920
just by the hand movements are very
vocal with their hands they probably

735
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,069
can't speak without the and in fact my
wife is that way she

736
00:42:11,069 --> 00:42:14,430
tied her hands behind her back she
probably couldn't speak but you might

737
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:15,509
have people that

738
00:42:15,509 --> 00:42:20,309
they they're like this if they they are
not willing to talk further said

739
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:23,769
their table like this you don't want to
come up to them and just be flamboyant

740
00:42:23,769 --> 00:42:26,039
hey what's going on there probably gonna
be put off by

741
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:29,910
once again reason Center cutie to help
bridge that gap between us

742
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:33,309
now this is a

743
00:42:33,309 --> 00:42:36,749
pretty old skit um and I use it because
it's

744
00:42:36,749 --> 00:42:40,730
it's a pretty decent Mary technique are
illustration and marrying but

745
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:44,480
breathing is probably the chrome to the
Crown

746
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,039
a LP and the fact that once you master
it

747
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:51,130
your pretty much a hypnotist and it used
in and

748
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:55,309
hear him hypnotics because you're doing
is you're matching your own greeting

749
00:42:55,309 --> 00:42:59,910
with the other persons reading and in
doing so once you match it to a certain

750
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:00,710
extent

751
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:04,210
now you can manipulate that person by
breeding faster

752
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:10,140
or shower now one thing about this one
caveat if your man and

753
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:15,069
your try to match a woman's breeding
probably not the best idea he stared

754
00:43:15,069 --> 00:43:15,700
chest

755
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:18,829
had probably get your intro said

756
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:22,200
look at the shoulder level the shoulders
move just as much as the chest us turn

757
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:22,999
breeding so

758
00:43:22,999 --> 00:43:26,269
when you're matching you can actually
yeah

759
00:43:26,269 --> 00:43:30,430
well as much fun but if you're trying to
bridge that gap

760
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:33,980
a and and know that report near

761
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:37,720
you might get a few later on after bill
that report

762
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:42,580
cool yet depends on what you're into

763
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:45,820
okay so the wrap up here on this one
really trying to get across is that

764
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:46,760
we're using

765
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:50,670
that we have this mindset social
engineering and media has a mind set 10

766
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:51,619
how it works and

767
00:43:51,619 --> 00:43:55,250
as a security he will have a how it
works really we need to look at the

768
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:56,040
human element

769
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:02,020
itself we apply social engineering and
manipulation a technical level we think

770
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:02,490
about

771
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:05,720
you know gather in credentials and a

772
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:09,000
information chemicals think about taking
%uh people's identities and things like

773
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,599
that but

774
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:13,020
really understanding what we're looking
at

775
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:17,570
it helps us not only build report with
other people but it helps identify how

776
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:21,260
people are trying to take advantage of
us and so

777
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:25,440
taking this information home we can
actually use it to better educate

778
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,450
our families or especially since we're
all professionals here

779
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:33,520
a almost there is a professional here a
we can take it back and help to protect

780
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,430
our company's

781
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:38,470
I'll there's a lot of the seaward

782
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:42,550
up threats out there and we want to make
sure that we help

783
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:47,890
in every way we can. that we're talking
like to answer any questions

784
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:54,890
there re: thank you

785
00:44:55,430 --> 00:45:01,780
great to have great to have a an
engineering here to give us perspective

786
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:05,180
after I would agree to be called an
engineer I just hate that

787
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:12,180
it says 10 min pet peeve any other
questions

788
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:15,400
alright well here my slideshow is up I

789
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,529
uploaded just before coming in here
anyone wants their some additional

790
00:45:18,529 --> 00:45:19,349
research is

791
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:23,079
are pretty large books on but they're

792
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:27,279
interesting read say the least I'm been
wanting to do

793
00:45:27,279 --> 00:45:30,869
something like this for a long time and
is great actually

794
00:45:30,869 --> 00:45:34,799
we kind of pushed into it so I have a
better understanding because

795
00:45:34,799 --> 00:45:39,140
actually gonna be working on building
I'll a social engineering awareness

796
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:39,729
program

797
00:45:39,729 --> 00:45:43,479
and actually another presentation we
doing how to build it yourself

798
00:45:43,479 --> 00:45:46,650
so this is great for me and I hope it's
been good for you thanks
