1
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:04,390
I everybody

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,930
everybody away no

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:12,250
RA fight so at just to get some people
warmed up

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:17,120
if you're a developer stand anybody
developer you

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,119
come on stand-up your view arts we get a
handle on developing our developer you

6
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:21,770
guessed it out

7
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:27,029
re: how many people are operations
administration outside a house stand-up

8
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:31,150
yeah that's me too so Marty standin'

9
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,840
call thank you so just curious I'll

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,579
I'm largely going to be talking about
the operations side of things

11
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,980
for the stalk cell the talk is on high
personal computing

12
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:47,630
%uh the its kinda my perspective on
things

13
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,180
hopefully it's a perspective the you
guys will be able to learn something

14
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:51,790
from

15
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:56,140
I'll be going into the cinema in detail

16
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:00,090
for how these large operations are run

17
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,940
and what a personal computing as well so

18
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,100
and Nick Fury

19
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,680
if you don't know me I've been doing
this for a long time I

20
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,930
came to the very first Carolina
governor's staff

21
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:17,930
can make the second year in spoke on
robotics

22
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,970
I have done some other talks so long

23
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,330
very array of subjects so

24
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,270
I if I happen to mention a company you
work for or have friends that work for

25
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,970
please don't get upset and cry

26
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,000
I don't care I it's just how it is

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,259
so I had some these companies that I
talk about I'd

28
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:40,850
I have my slant on this so the way I
view things

29
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,970
as the only perspective I can really
give you so nobody's paying me to do

30
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:45,479
this

31
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,240
I used to work for one of the companies
I mention large depressed a dinosaur

32
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,670
I no longer work for them I work for
completely different company

33
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,100
that has nothing to do what so ever with
cloud computing

34
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,540
or hyper skill infrastructure at all
which is fantastic

35
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,270
so it's a hobby I'm really good at it
though

36
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:07,470
I think I think I gotta what an
interesting insights

37
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:11,779
other people have and where you guys all
want something from

38
00:02:11,779 --> 00:02:17,319
so basic outline I I put some cat
pictures throughout the presentation

39
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:20,510
they're all animated up we'll keep you
guys distracted

40
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,629
you do get bored with the topic it's a
little

41
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:28,169
dense at times so my plan is to educate
and inform you

42
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:32,199
talk about some key concepts so talk
about the players in this space

43
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:35,469
I I'm also going to you

44
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:38,499
talk about the pretty pictures that come
up

45
00:02:38,499 --> 00:02:41,559
so and I mean a look at some attack
vectors potential

46
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:45,969
areas exploit for these large
infrastructures I'm also going to talk

47
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:47,719
about the hardware and software side

48
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:52,279
potential vulnerabilities there as well
and there's all kinds of crazy theories

49
00:02:52,279 --> 00:02:58,749
so simple its why you should take this
seriously

50
00:02:58,749 --> 00:03:02,900
so the cloud isn't going away and when I
say the clout by the way you're more

51
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,790
than welcome to turn this talking to a
drinking game

52
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:08,699
with the cloud every time it said so
hopefully your liver Suraj

53
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:12,029
I it's not going away right

54
00:03:12,029 --> 00:03:16,299
this idea that somebody else has your
data the idea that somebody else is

55
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:18,589
running your company's infrastructure
its

56
00:03:18,589 --> 00:03:21,809
gonna keep getting worse so it's not
going to get better

57
00:03:21,809 --> 00:03:26,249
so anybody who thinks that they can put
their security jacket on and going to

58
00:03:26,249 --> 00:03:27,159
meetings and go

59
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:30,959
I'm never going to let our company's day
to go anywhere other than here

60
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,309
it's not gonna work for you you will
lose the reason you're going to lose

61
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:36,540
because it's becoming more and more
expensive

62
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,620
everyday to run the infrastructure that
your company

63
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:44,370
hands so and some love you might be
working for companies were it's probably

64
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,699
a drop in the bucket right now

65
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:49,150
you probably don't see the power bill
justly it's going to get worse

66
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,499
so as a species we are using more energy
every day

67
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:55,569
then we did the previous day and it
keeps getting worse

68
00:03:55,569 --> 00:04:00,249
it's not going to get better game if you
think that

69
00:04:00,249 --> 00:04:03,389
BYOD is just a trend it's not

70
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:06,979
it's gonna get worse again other people
on your data

71
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:11,319
used to it so that's how this is going
so the best thing I can tell you

72
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:14,359
is to learn about what these guys are
doing with their infrastructures

73
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:18,620
and start questioning them about how
they're running their operations

74
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,909
because that's as much control as you're
going to have so

75
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:25,250
the yep

76
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,250
by the way the NSA's taken it seriously

77
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,210
yet another reason to so what is my
personal computing

78
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,120
so it's a bit of a nebulous term I
basically it's

79
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,870
used in the industry to define very
large data centers

80
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,949
I don't mean the

81
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:47,020
let's say 2008 3,000 square foot data
center

82
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,189
that most you probably are familiar with
I don't mean that sixteen server sitting

83
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:53,539
in a telco Iraq but shouldn't be there
in the

84
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:57,580
closet your office that's not it

85
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,759
a lot of the stuff can be applied to the
smaller architectures but it really

86
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:01,289
doesn't

87
00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:05,080
come to you fruition into you star

88
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,520
a quiet too much much larger set-ups so

89
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,000
I wall at some point talk about china
what they're doing in your

90
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,020
understand the scale so

91
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:20,090
the scales massive it's huge it's a
scale-out architecture is designed for

92
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,699
mobile processors

93
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:26,169
lots and lots of them so it's designed
to distribute data across

94
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:29,740
as many different servers as possible
it's redundant its

95
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,599
highly scaleable it's geographically
independent in some cases

96
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:40,180
said if they happens so Amazon for
instance with their stuff that happens

97
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,810
a data center in Northern Virginia for
some reason magically

98
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:49,539
the one in New York comes online or the
10 for

99
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:52,979
I we're also going to talk about
software-defined style

100
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:58,379
so I'll this is kinda something that's
been driving me crazy lately

101
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:01,949
is this software-defined everything so
VMware in particular

102
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:05,979
a really bad about it as hyped up at all
their marketing recently

103
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:09,259
so their big thing they bought on this
era which is a software-defined

104
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:10,599
networking company

105
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:14,379
they're trying to sell it Cisco trying
to get on board to you jokingly

106
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:18,879
said they were still doing hard fine
networking which is kinda funny

107
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,249
Cisco's gonna there there about to lose

108
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:25,879
a lot of money in the space there and
because they haven't kept up with what

109
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:27,150
the industry's been demanding

110
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:32,180
which is cheaper shit so in general as
consumers we all want cheap stuff

111
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,490
so companies want the same thing a port
so its offer to find its

112
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:39,990
commodity hardware it's cheap
off-the-shelf stop it's things that are

113
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,780
coming from

114
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:46,139
Williams anti-war so companies like was
tryna

115
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,520
a service there's a handful so

116
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,279
I'll on top of that there putting open
source software

117
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,539
so putting a distribution 1x and some
variety

118
00:06:56,539 --> 00:06:59,990
and on top of that their implementing
standards when API's

119
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,110
so in the case in software-defined
networking waters

120
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,659
based on OpenFlow which is the latest
and greatest products

121
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:10,430
so they're applying these open API
Stewart

122
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,120
so they're documenting the API said that
the API's our way it's called by

123
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,259
the code that everybody's right for
these things

124
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:20,610
that was our model everybody knows right
seven layers

125
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:24,159
anybody know have no prizes to give away

126
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:28,560
so anybody wants call by the way you're
more than welcome to enter a plea at any

127
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,889
point during this if you guys have
questions

128
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:34,789
but the bottom line is that was a lot I
was on models getting a lot more complex

129
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:38,360
branded the model still applies I'm not
telling you that it's changing

130
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,419
what I'm telling you is the each one of
those layers is getting lots and lots of

131
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,020
it all

132
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,150
somewheres K and it's just getting worse

133
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:52,150
so that's not necessarily bad yes

134
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:14,010
that's parker what I'm getting at with
I'll talk about that went into the

135
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:14,940
attack vectors

136
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,210
abouts definitely your your getting
going in the right direction I believe

137
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:22,030
so you're gonna see that as the stuff
becomes more complex you're gonna see

138
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,560
vulnerabilities Leichhardt mean

139
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,400
hardly multiply so and you're not what's
really irritating i think is that you're

140
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,440
not going to know about it

141
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,500
because as a consumer in these
technologies somebody uses Gmail

142
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,990
whatever you happen used up go that
matter your

143
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,840
not gonna see this the guys who are
running the backend infrastructure

144
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,030
they're the ones who have to go in and
clean up this mess and they're probably

145
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,250
not even aware of it

146
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,420
so and it's just going to get worse so

147
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,740
the story of love high personal
computing is really the story until

148
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:57,480
so back in the day rate Intel main RAM
chips

149
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,820
K the name for a barge different
manufacturers for large

150
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,840
mainframes essentially so back IBM

151
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,380
all those guys rate so Intel comes along
though

152
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,420
with this magical x86 actually

153
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,560
wasn't but they came along started
manufacturing processor

154
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,470
right so the star manufacturing these
things they start going in the home

155
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,510
personal computers

156
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:23,020
when it comes along revolts comes out
with black cherry

157
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,920
rights it's a these guys who are banking
on you nixon's system 5 stuff all day

158
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,260
long can go home

159
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,210
and all the sudden they're able to take
their work home with them

160
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:36,130
and start packing on the whole on their
home personal machine

161
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:41,000
K using likes what's happened over the
last

162
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,160
really twenty years is that

163
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,260
it's come full circle where now taking
those technologies

164
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,420
we've all been taking home and we're
bringing them back into the workplace

165
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,950
so x86 is now the dominant force

166
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:57,790
K intel's outlived Dec they've outlived

167
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:01,030
IBM which is pretty much the law
everything wholesale

168
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:04,160
novo at this point and they've outlived

169
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,140
handful of other companies as well so
create cetera

170
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,630
so these companies use to make
mainframes don't make em anymore sounds

171
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,910
pretty much dead at this point

172
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:16,370
there's probably a handful you have to
deal with spark really sorry

173
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,750
I if you do it's pretty much dead

174
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,170
whites Sun losing customers or so

175
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:26,990
for spark anyway that's paper and
everything x86 they're starting embraced

176
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:27,960
me and we're finally

177
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,660
despite the fact that we're as the most
nonsensical licensing requirements that

178
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,730
I think I've ever seen

179
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:36,480
say yet the story of my personal
computing

180
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,140
really the story until so it's this rise
to dominance with so

181
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,550
on that no the largest customers for
these guys

182
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:47,860
or companies that we've heard so I'm
gonna do is

183
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,500
will game again I have no privacy away
and

184
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,670
some cricket suckers but the pure
prehistoric from

185
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:58,530
so the I'm gonna put up a slide

186
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,760
you guys can tell me somebody wants to
raise a hand and tell me reported out

187
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,180
here what company this is

188
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,650
so there's a first on an easy one
anybody

189
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:12,730
net Google

190
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:17,330
so right so this is Google's

191
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:20,900
latest and greatest data center what
you're gonna notice in these pictures is

192
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,030
there's a unique particularly Google
with this one this one's

193
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:29,080
couple generations behind tell my guess
is probably about three where they are

194
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,760
currently

195
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,040
arm what you're gonna notice though is

196
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,360
there's a lack of fancy black panels
covering

197
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,090
hard drives & systems there's a distinct
lack

198
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:45,980
wiring for the most part there's will
itself Google

199
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,010
as a company is all about something
called you re

200
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:53,180
for their data centers so pues power
usage effectiveness

201
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:57,210
what they're trying to do is get this
down to a ratio one which is the ideal

202
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:02,080
fantastic ratio they're probably right
now if I had to guess at a ratio

203
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,160
maybe one to 1.3 what that means

204
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,070
is series a ratio how

205
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:14,550
how much of the energy that goes into a
data center is used for

206
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:19,350
the actual it. work versus how much in
the energy is used for things like power

207
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,410
and cooling

208
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:23,990
and keeping admins alive and

209
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:27,160
whatever else needs to be me run in this
dataset

210
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,990
game Google is super super secret but
their data center designs

211
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:36,589
so they weren't the first company that I
know I love to have production grade

212
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,589
software-defined networks they've been
running their data centers on on it for

213
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:40,740
a long time now

214
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,360
you would never know this you're not
supposed to know this this is all back

215
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,360
in stock free

216
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,020
they do a very good job hiding the
slayings there one in Intel's largest

217
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:49,730
customers

218
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,870
so the latest and greatest from Intel if
you guys are familiar with the

219
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,880
semiconductor manufacturing process the
way this works is

220
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,040
until turns out ships K nonstop so they
make them on waivers

221
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,280
maybe something called bending what that
is they take

222
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:08,420
the chips that are on there and based on
the

223
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,589
quantities that they need they will in
turn take

224
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:14,650
certain shit saw based on the features
that are available to them

225
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:18,500
so in the case and some dyes some other
course don't work so

226
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,180
all the sudden if you've got one core
that doesn't work on a six-core chip

227
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:26,170
18 taking one or two of them all off and
defuse them

228
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:29,490
are a few things that are closed and
magically its four core chip

229
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:33,120
rate turn around and sell it so if they
couldn't do that then they'd be stuck

230
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,200
with the forty five core chip then they
wouldn't be able to sell it for anything

231
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,230
they don't do that smarter so

232
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:43,100
the latest and greatest from Intel
there's a very good chance

233
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,120
that companies like Google are telling
Intel one instructions to put on the sea

234
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,070
use I is a data center and then don't
know what the hell's on my chip anymore

235
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:55,560
K and it's really hard to find now water
its

236
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,430
so on and it's behind DA's that Intel
will make people sign

237
00:13:59,430 --> 00:13:59,939
and

238
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:03,149
even then I'm not entirely certain that
I believe everything is there

239
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:07,160
in this whole shit when the USA recently
makes me question things even more

240
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,629
because if they've got guys working at
Google

241
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:13,129
there's a damn good chance they've got
guys working at Intel so

242
00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:16,739
I would see a

243
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:20,589
a Google one of the great things with
them you can find out what information

244
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:22,169
about them just by looking at what

245
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:26,399
contributors are meeting code wanna be
open for projects that are out there so

246
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,149
it's a great way to find out how

247
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:33,419
to you whole information back so we said
but often meta-data yesterday

248
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:37,040
one of the cool things I found as you
can actually go with the meta data for a

249
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,089
wannabe opens work projects that exist

250
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:42,499
and you can actually look at where the
contributors are coming from

251
00:14:42,499 --> 00:14:46,649
which countries there summoning code
from which companies there representing

252
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:50,410
which ones are was to his personal and
you can go

253
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:53,549
reverse engineer from there you want
more and more

254
00:14:53,549 --> 00:14:58,379
detailed information so Google does a
lot of white papers

255
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:02,279
you kinda have to know where to look for
you have to know the name to the people

256
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:02,660
doing

257
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:07,249
researched actually by now so

258
00:15:07,249 --> 00:15:14,249
art national now Facebook

259
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,480
so Facebook

260
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,220
has started something called the Open
Compute Project

261
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,549
so the story for Facebook is really all
about the Open Compute initiative

262
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:30,399
basically Facebook realize they were
getting creamed by Google in this space

263
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,269
and they weren't doing enough research
for it so instead of trying to

264
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:37,699
buy into it which is typically their
response to most things

265
00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:41,189
they went out and actually found this
initiative

266
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:44,720
on the Open Compute Project Open Compute
is a

267
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,299
settled hardware specifications settled
standards

268
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:51,319
that they're using to build

269
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:55,009
you were and you were generations
adequately so it's basically that

270
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:58,289
that for the first generation in this
they created an Intel based motherboard

271
00:15:58,289 --> 00:15:59,739
in any in the maze motherboard

272
00:15:59,739 --> 00:16:02,929
to find some stuff on the back a bit see
actually orderliness

273
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:06,499
slotted into iraq in power thing on
wei-wei instant

274
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:12,389
you rate its getting more more complex
as the time goes on they're starting to

275
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:13,850
find more standard with the

276
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:17,679
define standards for storage their
defining standards for networking

277
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:21,069
there's defining standards for
interconnects to choke you later

278
00:16:21,069 --> 00:16:25,439
so I have a feeling that before too long
you're gonna see

279
00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:28,610
opens for specifications report I'll
little final

280
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:32,889
air further up together not super
familiar with data centers typically

281
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:38,470
you have hollow were you're standing on
top of it anywhere from one foot above

282
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,429
the ground

283
00:16:39,429 --> 00:16:43,379
three-year five-feet some instances its
following air underneath

284
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:46,629
it's going up in front of the servers
the servers are sucking the cold air and

285
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:49,369
on the front side it's going out the
back exhaust

286
00:16:49,369 --> 00:16:53,739
hot hot air rises rate see you have
stuff in the ceiling which in turn take

287
00:16:53,739 --> 00:16:55,529
certain files back into the four

288
00:16:55,529 --> 00:16:58,929
and kinda crazy alice is working

289
00:16:58,929 --> 00:17:02,929
so Facebook's gotten really good at this
they've done this

290
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:07,360
Open Compute Project its kinda cool I
appreciate the fact that they've

291
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,019
down open source thing with it I do
question if it's

292
00:17:12,019 --> 00:17:15,959
entirely the right direction to go but
I'm glad that I can at least go find out

293
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,589
information about where their app

294
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:20,860
with their designs and I know that
Facebook in their data centers isn't too

295
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,779
far ahead of what the latest and
greatest

296
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:26,230
debates are on project for

297
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:29,659
so talk about china

298
00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:32,889
as I've got chairman Mel clapping so

299
00:17:32,889 --> 00:17:36,929
China being China stole the Open Compute
Project

300
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:39,970
from Facebook and I mean girl he stole

301
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:43,960
damn thing and rebranded as project
Scorpio

302
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,179
the only thing that they really added
which is

303
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:51,120
very very interesting to me years later
player

304
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,370
that allied

305
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:58,629
there we go so

306
00:17:58,629 --> 00:18:03,539
anybody read that says asa positioning
and management with GPS

307
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:06,990
game Chinese data centers are so large

308
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:11,350
that a guy with a flashlight and a map
can't find the damn server anymore

309
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:14,799
they can just go turn a little blue
light on

310
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,820
to go find out where it is hey if you're
familiar with servers management concept

311
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,720
there's a little

312
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,059
Information Line on most about rate say
usual sending

313
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:26,590
management tool I am and I'd rack

314
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:30,470
I will whatever the fuck they were
calling IPMI

315
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:35,750
well I PMI's actually the standard for
interfacing to its I PMI's a bigger

316
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,440
industry-wide thing all the different
companies have a

317
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,470
web-based we had some sort for these
things that actually talk to the server

318
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:47,159
might IPMI at least as I understand it

319
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:50,340
so so yes China

320
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:54,309
took Open Compute they said this is
great

321
00:18:54,309 --> 00:18:57,369
let's add more so what are they at they
added a GPS chip

322
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:01,029
everyone in the servers so think about
that for a second

323
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:04,110
this is a data center so large that can
find a server

324
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,200
you need GPS K

325
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:14,200
trying to buy more right

326
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:42,650
yet there's there's also I I have a
feeling

327
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:46,980
this is just some slide from some random
ass slide deck up all of our foreign

328
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:51,570
and I believe it's legitimate far as I
know missus

329
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:54,570
if you go poke around and actually try
and find information about this

330
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,900
Scorpio stuff it's really difficult
following on

331
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:02,360
not the least of which I don't speak
Mandarin so yet anyway

332
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,040
I bottom line being GPS is

333
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,440
a method of doing this you can actually
within a data center's by triangulating

334
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,150
signals

335
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:14,510
so anybody super into radios can tell
you all about you can locate

336
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,520
money so Nick comes to mind

337
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,060
how they found Raleigh callin same basic
idea

338
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:26,830
art so known now night

339
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:30,520
have any pictures him on

340
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,020
you think I would anybody

341
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,620
now on Amazon we'll talk about Amazon

342
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,850
Twitter no wealth

343
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:45,380
more somebody now Microsoft nope

344
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:50,070
our Walmart uses IBM so it would be a
picture about you

345
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:53,240
random black boxes so nope

346
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,660
Rackspace to

347
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,050
are we've all heard them yes so

348
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:04,470
the story Rackspace is really the story
love OpenStack

349
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:07,530
rate so how many people work with
OpenStack anybody

350
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:11,530
couple alright cool so hopefully you
guys are contributors

351
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:14,970
the fantastic projects got some
interesting implications that actually

352
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:15,860
ever manages to

353
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:20,270
going the contributors to these projects
are familiar names

354
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:23,990
its del its HP I DM its

355
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:29,360
anybody you can imagine Rackspace got
into it because they were hosting

356
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,530
as far as I understand it nasa stuff
nasa was doing this

357
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:35,890
nasa has abandoned ship and flown the
coop

358
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:41,630
Amazon now which is a common story oddly
enough so

359
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:46,790
open stacks kind of an alternative the
VMware and hyper-v but not really

360
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:51,050
it's not a hypervisor it's more it's
it's a lot more than that it's for the

361
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,560
management setup for

362
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,620
hypervisors but it's more than that to
because it's a management setup

363
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:00,200
for software defying things

364
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,920
so its kinda nebulous which is funny

365
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,620
is parliament's anyway it its it's out
there

366
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:11,740
so on it's very complex I will tell you
that if you have not

367
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:16,030
taken me opportunity to go woke up
OpenStack previously good

368
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:19,560
that it's a big thing it's going to
continue to be a big thing right now

369
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,140
until companies realize the

370
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:24,200
posting their own shit is really
expensive the nation a somebody else to

371
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:24,620
do it

372
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,770
which they're starting to you arm

373
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:31,610
it was designed for massively large two
points

374
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:36,470
so its based around open for sleepy eyes
and in particular its compatible with

375
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:37,090
other

376
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:41,190
API's the latest and greatest from
Rackspace is that they're looking to

377
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,800
your partner or bball

378
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,120
out I don't know how that's going to go
yet

379
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:50,320
if I were to guess I'd say age here
tells a potential

380
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,600
person by the mail petrol companies to
buy the mail I

381
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,970
if IBM had any brains at all at the sea
level

382
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:01,360
and maybe they would the don't arm

383
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,040
yep so that leads me to these guys

384
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,140
anybody and isn't blurry as hell

385
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:12,740
and if you can and Amazon so the recent
blurry as hell

386
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,920
because finding out anything about what
these guys are doing

387
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:20,010
has been extraordinarily difficult
Amazon

388
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:23,770
is like everybody thinks Apple's really
good at keeping secrets

389
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:26,830
you know no I promise you

390
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:30,880
from adidas their perspective it's much
easier hide stuff on Apple

391
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,170
that is on Amazon so

392
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:38,770
everybody else in this space is playing
catch-up these guys

393
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:42,430
Amazon did this first K this is a
company

394
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:47,180
its sole books baby

395
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:51,050
IBM a company that has been doing
computers

396
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:54,140
since the dawn of time K

397
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:58,080
you guys didn't see the

398
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,310
CIA lawsuit that happened during so

399
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:05,930
CIA said we need some computing
resources I'd be in stepped up to the

400
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:06,940
plate and said

401
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:11,380
yeah we got that we need government
contracts no problem amazon also stepped

402
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,090
up and said

403
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:15,670
we will help the L IBM lost

404
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:20,210
ID and threw a hissy fit K they got
their butts kicked in court

405
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:24,140
and way cryin' and said Amazon cheated

406
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:27,510
Amazon didn't she'd it was wrong but
they didn't K

407
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:30,750
it's a little more complex than that but
the bottom line is Amazon morning

408
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:34,720
contract Amazon now running the CIA's

409
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,010
using their infrastructure and
technology so

410
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:42,860
it's really really really difficult to
find information about these guys

411
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:47,040
I tried so what are the ways that I've
learned to find information about

412
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:51,330
style is not my working for direct
sources of information

413
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:55,180
but by looking into resources and
information one of the most telling is

414
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,300
job postings

415
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:01,620
and HR people who are more than happy to
interview just about anybody is it turns

416
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,880
out

417
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,030
so if you talk to these guys
particularly the HR people and

418
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:11,430
mention certain technologies in things
and they know to look for

419
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:15,290
they'll respond accordingly okay

420
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:19,770
do you guys use axe oh yeah I've got
that on my list

421
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:26,400
see arm when you start getting past the
first level Hren to the management level

422
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,520
into the folks you actually run things
they'll give you even more information

423
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,110
so it's a great way to find out
information about you're running for

424
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,180
infrastructure and

425
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:38,490
turn yeah

426
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:41,890
go apply for jobs how you might get one
process itself

427
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:44,920
I mean is crazy as it sounds like

428
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,980
it's what to do Blake

429
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:52,110
so again this is a hobby for me more
than anything else but

430
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:55,410
it's very interesting to me the fact
that they're willing to give away so

431
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:58,870
much to people who are potential
candidates for the company

432
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:01,890
I don't know that they realize how much
they give away

433
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:05,120
so and I'm not saying they give away not
gonna give you password

434
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,520
you're interviewing now K they're gonna
give you information that they would not

435
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,700
normally be willing

436
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,400
share these companies don't publish with
other companies

437
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,730
so very common industries for

438
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:21,030
EMC to offer a discount to some company
because

439
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:24,810
they wrote up a fantastic review in a
white paper about how they're using in

440
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:28,540
sees latest and greatest storage product
whatever reiterate

441
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:33,070
you don't see that with Amazon Amazon's
not running in sees garbage

442
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:36,540
is offering their own storage
architecture so you have to ask

443
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,450
questions about

444
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:40,970
what it is where they got it from
Amazon's not a storage company

445
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:45,190
not a company that sits around and makes
hard drive to rate their

446
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:49,410
sitting around paying guys to figure out
what the latest and greatest open source

447
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,670
technology is

448
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:54,350
that they can go to morrow in and start
contributing to that

449
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:58,650
code base so again other way to find out
information about

450
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:02,710
so Amazon as a bee eyes for just about
everything as far as I know they were

451
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:03,300
the first

452
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,850
on the scene with Jeep you GBG

453
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:10,230
you so general purpose graphics
processing stuff

454
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:13,380
they're basically using in video cards
allowing you access to

455
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:17,870
have API's into its even stand up an
instance in while all you can

456
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:21,300
do whatever password cracking you need
to some like they've actually got

457
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,870
instances specifically for that

458
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:26,740
which is really cool me on Amazon's how
deep the ice for the stuff from the

459
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,220
get-go

460
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,510
they're built around which is really
really impressive when you consider the

461
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,740
fact that

462
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:35,010
VMware just came out with their BC %eh

463
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:39,940
yes the VMware hybrid cloud there the
HCS hybrid cloud solutions something

464
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,060
like that

465
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:46,030
I basically VMware's playing catch up to
these guys and they've created a cloud

466
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:50,540
environment doesn't have the PI's

467
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:54,630
yet it's silly like I'm I want to be
able to make arrest calling creativity

468
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,590
and instantly I don't wanna after

469
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:59,800
see hearing click buttons for twenty
that's not what I'm

470
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:03,360
it's pointless very bad so

471
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,070
initially Amazon was based off apps and
they've kinda moved on from there I

472
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:07,970
think

473
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:11,330
I don't know under percent I know that
they still use it but I think they've

474
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,850
moved on beyond that

475
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:16,050
so they have lots and lots of different
services you need

476
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:20,870
you you need database stuff they've got
red shift now

477
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:25,200
when they've got accelerated database is
the coolest thing that I'd seen them do

478
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,030
by for was they said that this is how
much it costs to run

479
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:32,370
an hour CPU time so one processor equals

480
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:36,290
this much money so 7 cents for one hour
game

481
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:40,040
then they said well you've committed to

482
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,910
having that CPU you're not using all
that so what we're gonna do

483
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:47,470
is we're going to offer a reduced rate
for somebody who wants to come in

484
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:50,760
use the CPU that you're not using
sinners they're taking the

485
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,550
the leftover bit the your wasting
because you're not using it they're

486
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,810
charging you for the first

487
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:59,080
even though you're not using it they're
going you're not using this

488
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:05,060
I'm going to you schedule a lower
priority task in that same spot

489
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:08,550
and charged them money you and their
charge them worse but I'm gonna charge

490
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,160
them money

491
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:13,530
is they're making money off the waist I
can really knows that

492
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:18,320
so there in tolls largest customer by
for

493
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,320
so their data center growing growing and
growing

494
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,700
or them largely because Netflix and the
fact that all

495
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:29,210
then you watch TV shows like you
wouldn't believe

496
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:32,980
Netflix is one other big its customers
so the Fortune 500 companies are all

497
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,480
starting

498
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,060
walk to them because they're realizing
IBM and HP and Dell

499
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:40,440
have stuff in this space so they're
going to these guys

500
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,800
so the best part is I can take a credit
card into my pocket without any special

501
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,330
fancy PO numbers are trying to pretend
to be a company in having a tax ID

502
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:53,520
take the credit card online the same
place I can get toilet paper subscribe

503
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,110
to

504
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:58,860
I can get a fuckin server K that's
really cool

505
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:02,560
so the others idea I mean the software

506
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,200
they don't have anything else they kinda
just bought their way into this not that

507
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,490
long ago

508
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:10,810
softwares knotted show

509
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,900
for it is not a very good one I

510
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:18,500
there not that big either so I don't
know that they're going to grow to be

511
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,940
that big they know guide me in the brand
name behind him

512
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:24,310
I'm sure somebody who's playing golf
with some exact is more than happy to

513
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,080
sign up for the services

514
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:31,429
but year now I i mean is also sold off
everything will never know if you look

515
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:34,350
online there are pictures of softwares
data centers

516
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:38,750
they don't use Lenovo equipment K
everybody's doing it and doing it

517
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,750
seriously

518
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:43,040
is no I using equipment from years

519
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,340
from companies like Dell like HP

520
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:50,210
him over lever they're not buying
servers like that anymore

521
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:53,890
they're buying servers by literally

522
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:58,040
the Creek fall from places in Taiwan

523
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,929
K there they're going overseas they're
saying hey

524
00:31:01,929 --> 00:31:05,530
would you mind taking this Intel chip
that we've got that we worked out with

525
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,640
Intel you're gonna put into the server
for as

526
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:11,950
in just using their standard
specifications in creating a motherboard

527
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:12,290
and

528
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:15,440
putting it on here in San it back to us
in it that's in our racks

529
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,640
all they want K server gets there they
booted up in the

530
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,820
however they're bringing it up most the
time it Dixie now

531
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:26,929
there running things of the network I
think handful might be using Flash

532
00:31:26,929 --> 00:31:28,780
locally on the system

533
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:32,030
attaching other lawyer words but I doubt
it I don't know why your local

534
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:36,040
us so anyway that's what these guys are
doing

535
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:41,340
so Microsoft as their Microsoft Azure
unless you're running exchanger office

536
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:46,510
I don't know why news on I guess you
want to put your domain controller Alan

537
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:50,010
and you can laugh but this is what
people will do so

538
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:53,300
they're starting to do so. stuff anybody
play with the SSO

539
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,700
Michael so it interesting

540
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:00,830
I Microsoft is putting that into you is
your as well

541
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:04,650
so Apple Apple's a little interesting

542
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:08,350
there's a lot of speculation that they
actually might be using Amazon

543
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:11,380
and they might be using sure involve
other services

544
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,990
I can for certain tell you that you xoxo
my for damn near everything

545
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:18,860
so anybody ever elected traffic from
iTunes

546
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:23,630
Marchar yet bounces off Marcum I goes
all over the damn place

547
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:26,940
I Apple built some fancy data centers

548
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:31,250
2011 North Carolina particular a

549
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:35,210
they've built these data centers but the
speculation is that they're probably not

550
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:38,620
really using there have been after

551
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:42,470
bill basically the time period when you
would expect to see trucks for equipment

552
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,490
rolling in

553
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:47,070
nobody's seen in trucks rolling so
handful here and there

554
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:50,440
and it's possible there is still
building out here some service that's

555
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,030
coming

556
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:54,720
me whatever whatever the new I which is
that they needed some

557
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,480
offer some service for but as of right
now nobody

558
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,710
reported a large amount of trucks moving
equipment out of this thing

559
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:05,169
so I don't know what I am

560
00:33:05,169 --> 00:33:08,360
do what the

561
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:15,360
lenore area so

562
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,790
I can't tell you the square foot into
the days are in love to be able to I

563
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:21,860
can't tell you exactly how to make any
other stuff is it's really hard to find

564
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:22,600
this information

565
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,070
turns out they don't want the stuff
getting out so it affects

566
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:29,730
their numbers so Amazon by the way
doesn't very interesting

567
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:33,080
thing Amazon doesn't report the exact
amount of money

568
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,370
for how much they make awful ec2

569
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:40,500
so they they put it in the other column
so when they purport their

570
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,880
revenue numbers game because they have
to a quarterly numbers

571
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,630
they going to report them and they say
we made as much money and they break it

572
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:48,950
out based on services

573
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:52,490
their retail industry and some other
things and then they have this column

574
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:53,260
called other

575
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:56,610
mysteriously that other column keeps
getting bigger and bigger screen

576
00:33:56,610 --> 00:34:01,080
here and so and we all know what it is
like everybody knows that

577
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,730
like everybody's really interested in it
to hell because its turns out there

578
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:08,160
on this really well and people are
starting to pay attention so

579
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:12,500
via its it's listed as other same thing
with Microsoft I don't know that they

580
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,630
report exactly how much revenue
generating office

581
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:19,050
so not big

582
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:22,720
it's not massive right now so everybody
doing this in

583
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:27,180
it's serious about it is moving Amazon
so I'm not saying about the right answer

584
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:34,180
I'm just telling you that's what the
industry doing yes

585
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:41,010
sure

586
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:44,470
it does it's using their services on the
back and so I don't know

587
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:47,850
enough about their special nonsense

588
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:52,320
so at the other so my point my
counterpoint to that would be the

589
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,840
PlayStation 4 is massively outsole

590
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,430
the ex parte 1 reno and continues to so

591
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:04,560
its there's I don't know that the demand
is there for Microsoft Services yet

592
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,130
if they can get the so the problem they
have and the problem everybody's got

593
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:10,860
with the space everybody's trying to
play catch-up Amazon right

594
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:15,460
so go look to read the news stories in
fact I'll tell you exactly what you can

595
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,680
search for in the boonies

596
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,680
go work for Amazon ec2 and then

597
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:25,210
the word its price reduction over the
last year and is on her knees prices

598
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:29,090
probably six times and they keep doing
it and the reason they're able to do

599
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:31,520
this is because the key buying more and
more shit

600
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,470
reducing the cost them what it takes for
ended one individual

601
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:38,790
instance to run so the more times you
can do that

602
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:42,690
the the more scale you can add the the
better your

603
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:46,300
able to take advantage in the economy of
scale K where you can go

604
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:50,420
you know what we've got fifty billion at
these one of them doesn't cost that much

605
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:53,790
so they can reduce the cost everybody
else is playing catch-up to this

606
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:58,020
because they can't get to that price
point so they need to go

607
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:01,140
way out either way and do what Google is
doing via the PC

608
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:05,230
anything trying to figure out how you
can get every last possible

609
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:09,860
energy wasting mechanism out of your
datacenter

610
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:16,100
and fix it said that you don't have any
energy that's wasted everything you have

611
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,549
in your data center is going to

612
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:21,050
it. awaited options so it's going to

613
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:25,120
you were overall mission who was
actually trying to do this and we're

614
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,410
doing pretty well with their

615
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:29,730
cue injured I think

616
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:36,690
so yet they

617
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:40,620
they do its computer engine is a commune
in

618
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:44,460
I does the name sorry so there's so many
of these names they all they all get

619
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,000
sort of

620
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,410
cloudy marine a see a

621
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:51,610
I i can tell you for certain Apple does
use a lot of that out

622
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:55,640
they have habitat hiring former IBM
employees

623
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:59,630
and a seem to have some interesting
CloudStack based on code

624
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:03,410
commissions yet are

625
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:08,410
fair enough

626
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:13,110
and so the Google Data Center here the
one in north carolina i think is

627
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:16,280
probably a generation behind the latest
and greatest from Google

628
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,460
I had yes so it hasn't seen any updates
recently

629
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:23,020
I'm aware of if you guys want to

630
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:26,560
this information I think one of the more
interesting facts you can find out

631
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,170
what's a lot of stuff about this

632
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:31,710
just by knowing through the

633
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:35,230
area and location around the data center
and what they're doing

634
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:39,460
so the local news and local commentary
from

635
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:46,460
from people in those areas is always
good yes yep

636
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:55,640
yep

637
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:04,150
allow yet

638
00:38:06,289 --> 00:38:10,400
yep yep

639
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,860
they are they don't like to talk about
this stuff

640
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:17,280
so it's really really hard to find out
about it see a

641
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,760
the Apple also there a lot of custom
stuff

642
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,940
and they're really smart and their
super-secret the people who work for

643
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:24,510
more

644
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,880
all fairly brilliant when it comes to
doing these things they're submitting

645
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,390
code

646
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:31,560
patches to very low level

647
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:35,890
low-level applications

648
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:39,340
so their submissions turn up and a lot
of

649
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:43,330
the the work goes into the XE stacked so

650
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:48,240
X 31 X it's shown up in some other
interesting locations to you

651
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,350
so let's talk about the NSA

652
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:57,119
and all others yes they can hear you now
yes

653
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,450
I don't worry about backups I got you
covered

654
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:04,280
so they know why kids love cinnamon
toast crunch

655
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,610
and share everything plan watching you

656
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:11,600
who and were soon might be too are
actually listening T

657
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:15,009
care now so the NSA is involved in this

658
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:18,540
somehow I don't know it has not come to
light yet so the latest and greatest

659
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,660
that i've seen

660
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:22,890
was the news that came out earlier this
week I

661
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:27,690
about the Cisco switches

662
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:31,090
routers basically they have a location
where

663
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:35,550
these guys from the NSA wall hijackers
Cisco router in

664
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:39,340
on its way to some foreign country they

665
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:43,800
take the Cisco router out on the Cisco
factory sealed box

666
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:48,140
figured out how to cleverly open in put
a put a new Cisco label on it

667
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:51,580
rate because I'm sure Cisco's not given
arm

668
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:55,350
and put some custom stuff on there and
in turn it back to them

669
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:58,890
if they can do this then

670
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:02,700
I'm just gonna go ahead and guess they
probably have

671
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,910
people at places like Intel

672
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:09,250
I'm willing to bet that they probably
have places and somebody Orleans

673
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,980
anti-war and

674
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:14,160
I'm willing to bet that bear getting
involved a

675
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:19,119
lower-level what we know so the stuff we
know about is what's come the white so

676
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:19,640
far

677
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:23,340
I guarantee you their stuff we don't
know about its kinda creepy

678
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:26,750
on that note I'm still using email from
my

679
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,980
sorry Lisa K give it up too hard

680
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:36,330
I don't know I

681
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:42,800
that well that's an interest so he did
his poignant like fart for

682
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,609
work local manufacturing spiked by Chip
here for national

683
00:40:47,609 --> 00:40:52,390
yearly yeah I don't know a I know that I
i don't know what China is doing either

684
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:55,530
so China they were

685
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:58,820
they were talking about china has also
been

686
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:02,640
talking about fracturing of from the US
for a long time creating your own see

687
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:09,310
use all this other nonsense they get to
do it kinda

688
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:13,160
kinda Cebu's are made worldwide now

689
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:17,280
so the should that happen to compare my
remember couple years ago or drive

690
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,350
prices went through the roof

691
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:21,930
so yes because of flooding one part in
the world

692
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:25,380
the air so that for all the hard drives
are made

693
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:28,930
yes when Intel realize a long time ago
right Intel had some smart people

694
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:29,890
working for their

695
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:32,890
that the sea level right more like you
know what we should really split up for

696
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,400
operations across the world

697
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,910
did so ships on come from one spot
morning all

698
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:44,910
yep No

699
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:10,270
so met talk about attack vectors on

700
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:13,620
some and with you definitely this is
good stuff snow

701
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:16,890
new again it to me in my mind it's

702
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:20,070
what the hell are these guys actually
doing because this is just the stuff we

703
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,620
know so

704
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:25,260
attack vectors if I were looking to
break into a data center

705
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:28,330
and looking to get involved with these
things I would start looking at the

706
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:29,130
developers

707
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:32,130
I'd start looking at where the code
contributions are going and I'm trying

708
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:32,960
to insert style:

709
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,380
that might be slightly areas and those
sources

710
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:40,990
so observe fairly open place there's all
kinds of interesting projects that are

711
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:41,720
going on

712
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:46,650
figuring out listening them not that
difficult I will tell you

713
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:51,220
Apple pierre Yves very cleverly doesn't
allow their employees to Sonic

714
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:54,230
code under the Apple very rarely anyway

715
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:57,310
they will either come employees to send
the code under the Apple

716
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:01,710
with your Apple email addresses so the
user in the water systems

717
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:05,220
so finding those employees is difficult
finding their contributions is also

718
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:05,820
difficult

719
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:09,570
so we don't know turns out anyway

720
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:14,380
a you can also talk to control point
which is where really the

721
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:17,950
entering code comes from so what is
environments have sort of two levels

722
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:21,410
so there's a level where all the data
actually is and there's the control

723
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:24,570
point so particularly what's offered by
networking

724
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:27,930
definitely a control point you have to
can avoid

725
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:31,380
I if you wilke at

726
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:35,910
that area I think that that is going to
be the most vulnerable spot

727
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:39,010
where you can insert potential abilities

728
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:43,690
where you can look for potential
normally attacking the hardware again

729
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:46,790
goes back to Los talking about Nina se
attacked the developers

730
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:51,660
on I guarantee you'd anybody in this
room read the Intel CPU around as they

731
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:52,130
come out

732
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:55,630
measures bill so see a

733
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:59,080
the CPU around as they come out theater
out like the bitch about if you guys

734
00:43:59,080 --> 00:43:59,350
know

735
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:03,030
yes his no use

736
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:07,620
though head guy for one yes the here

737
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:11,110
which one for years whichever one
OpenBSD

738
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:15,150
there we go the 1i didn't name so I am

739
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:18,810
so the likes to complain about it he's
made a couple very very public pose

740
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:19,880
shaming Intel

741
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,960
until still makes crappy products that
have security vulnerabilities

742
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,990
attack something with the fuckin CPU G

743
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:31,050
see i can tell you what all the
instructions are on a CPU

744
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:34,490
these days there's so many and the
instruction sets keep getting

745
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:37,810
their added to you bit by bit so the
same thing

746
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:41,140
ran in the machines I if you have
systems that have

747
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:44,470
more RAM the nation problem we have
because they're not based on Intel

748
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:45,630
reference design

749
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:48,950
and you've got a six probably chances
are you've got a six anyway

750
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:52,370
a sixer ships that are manufactured for
companies like

751
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:55,390
HP Dell to put in the systems are custom
chips

752
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:58,840
so they allow the system to do something
unique and interesting fundamentally

753
00:44:58,840 --> 00:44:59,790
different than the other

754
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:04,600
guy not really well as he sees the
memory checking for RAM

755
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:08,110
so yes you do it's not a sick though

756
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:11,110
because there's enough manufacture I
wouldn't I get sick is

757
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:14,020
I don't know I don't know where you draw
the line between sure there are some

758
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:14,800
technical

759
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,400
explanation we draw the line between a
second chip

760
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,680
I see by its to me

761
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:26,250
news again IPCC's there so many of them
but it's a great spot to start looking

762
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:27,280
for ability

763
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,330
potentially other controllers for any
other stuff

764
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:37,330
I'd start licking abilities their nope

765
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:42,930
potentially the Open Compute Project

766
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:47,250
they're using open source firmware I the
open source for

767
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:50,560
movement never really picked up that I
know of

768
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,070
so there's not really an open source by
its implementation all the vendors are

769
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:54,570
using

770
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:59,190
on but that being said the buyers the
firmware most it comes from the same

771
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:03,350
Orleans anti-one so yeah I potentially
go work there

772
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:06,650
and try and figure out what our
abilities if they're always here I'm

773
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:06,980
sure

774
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:10,260
back me up on that and say that that's
probably a fairly vulnerable spot

775
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:17,260
he's done a little better research in
things yes

776
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:29,930
yeah I am I

777
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:36,030
I know American megatrends there's a lot
about stuff I know they pop up all over

778
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:36,780
the place

779
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:41,240
so their research that i've done I don't
know

780
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:45,180
I'd be curious to see how many
vulnerabilities they publisher if they

781
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:48,030
publish anything at all or if anybody
publishes stuff for them

782
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:51,190
so I don't know so more intact vector

783
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:55,510
is the data itself so all these my
personal infrastructures

784
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:59,420
are based around the idea that there's a
massive data set that their crunching

785
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:02,840
so there's a lot more to numbers so you
can poison the dataset

786
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:06,740
so it's fasting can be fairly effective
and I know

787
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:10,580
gotta five minutes left so have my own

788
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:16,420
on c8 consumer surveys medical trials
burning data as more and more that

789
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:17,430
should give put out there

790
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:20,770
expected I mean I think people are gonna
start looking at the data rather

791
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:24,570
because it's easy rather than trying to
attack the actual

792
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:27,740
underlying infrastructure

793
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:30,960
so I suspect that's going to get more
more complex to do and

794
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,859
the skill set for doing it's going to
come or more specialized so as for

795
00:47:34,859 --> 00:47:37,760
preventing attacks if you happen to work
for one of these companies

796
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,970
so things I will tell you a hard outer
shell the soft squishy center done work

797
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:42,480
anymore

798
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,570
K you so you have to protect

799
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:48,760
everything all-points communication must
be secured

800
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:52,340
so I don't know that that necessarily
means sooo anymore

801
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:55,750
I'd be very curious to see what's coming
along

802
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:59,000
soon to potentially replace SSL

803
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,280
Sydney there's a better

804
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:06,080
for me secure communication so and I
suspect these guys are working on this

805
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:09,390
for their data centers so you need to
verify the data

806
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:13,010
you gotta control all your control
points such that they're redundant

807
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:17,800
their independent yarder so there do you
separate it so that it once I get hit

808
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:22,619
still got something come up in sites so
the future

809
00:48:22,619 --> 00:48:25,730
where things are going it's just gonna
get more dense so

810
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:29,830
Morsi using it crammed into a smaller
and smaller space so

811
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:33,609
Google's going to continue pushing Hwy
21.0 I suspect

812
00:48:33,609 --> 00:48:38,000
if they are already at they are think
they're very very close though

813
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,859
I you're gonna start see more CPU types
arm has now come up

814
00:48:41,859 --> 00:48:45,150
a lot smarter people were doing
development for phones and

815
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:48,810
no arm they don't necessarily fully
understand it but

816
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:51,850
your it's also come about the Uni

817
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:54,859
you have arms reviews available clouds

818
00:48:54,859 --> 00:48:58,570
people can magically create developer
instances out

819
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:02,980
great yeah tenia Maria

820
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:06,280
Titanic on thank God they finally

821
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:10,180
about %ah anyway I it's going to be easy

822
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:13,310
easily switchable between Cebu types RAM
types

823
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:16,490
to get to that second things are going
to be interchangeable

824
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:20,330
so you're gonna start to see software
that's based around

825
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:23,770
typically Control Point Software is
gonna start do you what Google's been

826
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:24,700
doing with ads

827
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:29,550
and continues to do with YouTube videos
google has machine vision

828
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:33,600
processing that they've created that
literally just goes in crawls YouTube

829
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,980
for videos and descriptions and comments

830
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:39,580
and proceeds to compile all that data
and they don't

831
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:43,650
understand how this works they just know
that it works in the use it with google

832
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:44,750
translate as well

833
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:48,200
so basically every time you go to a site
with your trains Lee it's getting better

834
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,310
and better translating

835
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:52,690
be a so the new site potentially or its
new data and you can

836
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:55,930
up to select things and correct them

837
00:49:55,930 --> 00:50:00,020
daughter whatever every time you do that
you're giving them more information

838
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:05,320
so Nikki buildings database of patterns
they don't know how this works

839
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:09,280
K I'm not joking like nobody like they
understand there's a pattern rate but

840
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:09,650
the

841
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:13,650
the pattern is generated by a computer
we don't understand what the pattern is

842
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:18,460
so it's just getting smarter and smarter

843
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:22,030
I'm not telling you that's going it's
coming maybe it is I have no idea

844
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:26,400
but 1 I'm telling you is the this is
going to get applied to

845
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,290
software-defined networks and going to
be applied so that if Traffic needs to

846
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:32,490
go somewhere it's gonna go there based
on

847
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:37,240
the the fact that it seem that sort of
traffic $17 billion times before

848
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:40,830
and so therefore it knows what to do
with it so that the warning patterns are

849
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:41,790
going to be applied

850
00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:46,410
the setup same thing for virtualization
virtualized workloads and everything

851
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:46,800
else

852
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,560
so you're gonna see that stuff get
smarter and smarter all

853
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:56,030
little which is kinda cool intel has
this fantastic playing they're calling

854
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:57,420
the disaggregated rack

855
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:00,530
which is a call there so

856
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:04,030
basically there going back to bleeds

857
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:07,440
and if anybody's ever done work on
points and other stuff

858
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:12,080
you typically have a box it's like an 09
u11 you hire Achary

859
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:16,030
imagine if you had a 42u rack filled
with these things itself like believes

860
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:19,060
that having closures made of metal and
everything else he just had a circuit

861
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:19,859
board

862
00:51:19,859 --> 00:51:23,000
K that's what the building on the
backend

863
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,720
you're starting to see fabrics converge
they're converging around PCIe is the

864
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,030
fancy standard

865
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:33,780
so its basically they're taking all the
work the infinite mana group has been

866
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:34,830
doing in there

867
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:38,920
in basically moving at one level lower
you level

868
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,960
it it makes it sad that you only have
one switch at the top iraq to get

869
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:42,670
plugged in

870
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:47,460
so you bring in Iraq war stop so

871
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:52,510
there's more on this so intel's doing a
lot of work for %ah picturing L

872
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:56,320
so I'll talk about this I these guys
right now they're talking about my

873
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:59,030
cursor vers particularly I don't know
why

874
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:02,970
pointless I a micro server is just a
server but

875
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:06,280
right now because they just started
doing this there judge me

876
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:09,670
they can't figure out a criminal ramen
listening to make it useful

877
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:12,750
so they're selling on the company's who
think they need lots and lots a little

878
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:13,500
tiny servers

879
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:16,570
I guess maybe some people workloads I
don't know

880
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:20,890
arm it

881
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:24,839
here anyway arm that's a tiny is one
computer

882
00:52:24,839 --> 00:52:29,100
at the scale it's a little different in
my opinion arm

883
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:33,330
yet so intel's starting this all these
things kinda they're starting

884
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:36,520
no right now in these actually the one
that selling the microserver they bought

885
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,890
a company called see my group primarily
for their

886
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:42,350
technology interconnects so which that's
the next big area

887
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:46,119
research so right now interconnect
between stop it slow it error-prone

888
00:52:46,119 --> 00:52:47,800
anybody has had to deal with

889
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:51,400
cleaning fiber optic cabling pain in the
ass free

890
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:54,420
so I hope so many as not alone in that
regard

891
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:58,410
so intel has literally redefined what a
fiber optic cable is

892
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:01,530
that things got I don't know 64 or 128

893
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:05,150
fiber connections inside a bit and
they're starting to use it

894
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:09,230
transfer PCIe over large distances yeah
I think my time is up

895
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:15,000
so I the blink sign in

896
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,619
arm see a the

897
00:53:19,619 --> 00:53:23,780
its continuing to grow interconnector by
far the most interesting thing

898
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:27,710
I think bringing so micro servers
there's lotsa lotsa

899
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:32,010
tiny tiny servers putting on ships kills
it was a company was doing this for the

900
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:32,460
warm

901
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:36,119
they've gone bust now I don't know if
they actually managed to solve all their

902
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:38,230
assets to some money or not had a lot of
energy

903
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:41,580
interesting intellectual property I
don't know that they sold the law

904
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:45,109
the biggest problem they faced with that
army isn't

905
00:53:45,109 --> 00:53:48,730
64-bit today Munich is nobody's got a

906
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:53,250
real 64-bit ARM chip out there coming
will be out within the next six months

907
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:56,900
that was by for calls it his biggest
problem

908
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:00,790
in the C my crew again so they started
to produce ARM chips to

909
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:04,109
which technical as a

910
00:54:04,109 --> 00:54:07,740
so in with my Arthur C Clarke

911
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:11,060
