00:00:00,789 --> 00:00:03,929
thanks everybody on so as he said i'm
patrick

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:07,210
11 snide I R

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,349
work around where other security
architect doing

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,950
large skillet heat of mitigation with
application are all around and stuff but

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,890
I have a a background in telephony

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,140
used to armitage our product security

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,240
for a security company to

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,689
I'm pretty much just around work for a
financial institution

9
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:31,520
on the app sixth of boarded-up 6 tough
economy

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,640
girls as well is at No real experience
in

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,239
we as it were which makes this a
wonderful

12
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,230
yes it is we have a nation re:

13
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,750
the standard disclaimer these are argues
and over

14
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,190
as anybody else and sorry earlier photos

15
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,280
are is soo

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,320
what why we keep doing it slow had to
come up with is a

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,489
had a I floor

18
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:04,050
became a one-day have 0 week if we could
do presentation

19
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:08,090
bosa yen I

20
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:12,720
really want to do this because arm you
know I started meeting a lot of the

21
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,780
or some some free her that comment up in

22
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,800
doing some reading in come to realize
that you know they were the original

23
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,229
a electron attackers I guess in the
monitor

24
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:26,380
anyways and you know before

25
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:30,189
we had all the stuff we had today really
the phone system was the only thing that

26
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:31,170
we can play around with

27
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,270
back on people that have personal
computers

28
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,290
so arm it's important I think

29
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,140
no what your legacy is with history is
and certainly

30
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,149
the types of things in the mental
approach be used

31
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:48,180
on in freaking really is for you today

32
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,800
so

33
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,980
we see things like you know new systems
that are developed like way

34
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,350
the first iteration with early design
for security

35
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:01,920
so known it was race is kinda like the
Internet this is like building

36
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,240
upon stuff but not necessarily security

37
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,050
mines so that proves I guess the title
the car

38
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,960
what goes around comes back around wall
covering this is

39
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,970
just a bit history Actelion

40
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,390
India or systems Mb cap stocks

41
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,360

00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,610
four-week changeable this is my usual a
small

44
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,500
companies is going to be like you
enterprise-level I spent so much money

45
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,870
on my phone system

46
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,560
this is moving to be small medium-sized
businesses

47
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,230
happy running appliances running astor's
school socialism

48
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,850
below the security tips at the end and
stuff for

49
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,290
comes out sorry yeah so the Republic
everything on get home

50
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,790
and the get home actually has a
reference sheet on it on the I

51
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:58,610
I actually sent to which security
engineer yesterday for proofreading she

52
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,790
wanted he pointed out

53
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,480
it up in office so other was pretty nice

54
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,400
alright so telephony history

55
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,400
arm you know the first will

56
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,100
human long-distance communication
electronic communication was

57
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,440
Telegraph and the Telegraph were all

58
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,570
our point2 points so individual on each
hand

59
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:23,650
with the actual holography kinda like
your

60
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,330
can stringer that you like that yeah and

61
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:31,840
every connection had a beer on you know
point point you couldn't there was no

62
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,450
magic thing in the middle that would
switch so you could

63
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,920
talk to different people with 121 in a
scene

64
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,740
thing happened with the

65
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:44,340
original only came you can actually if
you're rich

66
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,970
go and yea phone your office an iPhone
four your house

67
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:53,110
and the own for somewhere else but by
the way

68
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,410
you had to put second phone side the one
you're

69
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:01,100
had you the point the point that was it
on in they also charge people for

70
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:01,650
running

71
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,720
the wires so it you wanted that in

72
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,890
with two miles away you had to pay by
the foot for

73
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:11,690
for the wire in oh yeah by the way just
pay for that but you know it the

74
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,230
telephone company owns everything

75
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:17,400
arm there was a different world

76
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,790
totally yeah I N and there was no

77
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:24,080
dialing involve you you would pick it up
and you still have to talk to an

78
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,760
operator

79
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,220
say arm we're sorry went when it stopped
being pure appear

80
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,690
and they started putting evil operators
in are

81
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:36,750
so you could talk to different people
who also had phones it was all

82
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,750
pick up the phone tell them who you
wanna call and they'd make the manual

83
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,960
connection course the stars to catch on

84
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,510
more switchboards more people more wires
it's crazy

85
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:51,130
so the star trying to figure out what
they can do to

86
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:55,570
a simple final there's obviously that
scale too well and I'll

87
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:59,260
not all so arm interesting story

88
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:04,640
I guy named Al Stroger and your long
time for like omg I am I know this al

89
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,140
Stroger different guy arm

90
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,530
he was an undertaker now also on for

91
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:15,390
he was wearing black so out stroker

92
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:20,790
on with Undertaker is we found that his
business suddenly took a nosedive and

93
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,590
he was trying to figure out what the

94
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,000
the reason why so he ended up calling
his own number

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,380
and are telling operator he want to be
connected to you know his office

96
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,030
and also to get connected somebody else

97
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:37,720
turns out there was another Undertaker
in town who is stealing business from

98
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,420
him

99
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,240
because the guys wife was the operator
in town so

100
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,720
she would 30 call so

101
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,090
he was ticked off about that and decided
that he was going to come up with

102
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,100
something that would say

103
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,800
operators outer loop as you do anything
that

104
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,000
situation yes so so he came up with this
Stroger switch

105
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,130
and if you are the use like some other
or rotary dials we would hear that but

106
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:08,470
that was actually are electronic polls
being sent down

107
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:11,760
the line on so that the

108
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,460
the switch on the other side actually on
for me with

109
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,680
like a barrel shape it would actually
turn

110
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,710
in there was a little arm the talent
connection

111
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,890
that would actually will cross the girl
they had three bottom

112
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:28,420
you would I'll the hundreds place tens
place in the one place

113
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:32,950
separately you had to which the horror
many are times you wanted the

114
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:37,090
sounds complicated very complicated so
arm

115
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:40,230
when so fast-forward and

116
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:44,680
they introduce rotary dial phones on in
order for

117
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,500
one user to reach in other

118
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,080
they had to have a way of the on
representing what

119
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,450
what the dialing in the day was before

120
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:58,070
the user to dial so what you would do
when he called from before

121
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:01,450
user darling was you pick up the phone
and say I wanna talk to you

122
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:05,770
Wake Forest Road 137 that was the
exchange

123
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,910
you want to be connected to you and then
the user subscriber number

124
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:14,190
so those letters that you see on the
modern are touchtone phones today that

125
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,650
was their way of representing the
exchange numbers

126
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:21,810
on numerically for the the exchange
locations in america so weak force would

127
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,390
resolve the two numbers

128
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:30,210
and then the user extension so

129
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:33,240
the

130
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,930
the problem with are the system wasn't
an offer long distance dialing

131
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,020
so you still have a lot of operators and

132
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:45,770
operator workforce was growing and
growing as more phones were deployed so

133
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:50,510
are AT&T recognize that they had to come
up with a longer-term solution

134
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,520
because the would really looking at one
million employees

135
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,550
by maybe the mid sixties a or I should
say that's what they were going after

136
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,680
higher article did as a lot of people

137
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,780
yeah on sorry finds it built this thing
called our panel in crossbar

138
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,240
and introduced are common control so

139
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,240
basically when you dial the number it
would build up that number in something

140
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,640
called

141
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,930
sender and then the sender would

142
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,340
on

143
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,820
or Donovan the dial numbers to the
switch

144
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,440
kinda stored in memory in send right
exactly than I should mention that was a

145
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,110
problem with the stroker switch when you

146
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:30,550
when you dialed it made that connection
for you hell that's wish for the entire

147
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,180
duration

148
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:35,060
also but I don't feel uses yet either so

149
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,260
arm that allowed them to star

150
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:42,680
a no conserving some resources I guess

151
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,680
and Dom for the the problem was still
making routes from city to city was

152
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,300
difficult

153
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,130
still had to talk to you operators maybe
more cooperators because they had to

154
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,310
like call one another

155
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:56,540
all the way through in do all this
planning stuff so

156
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,860
before a crossbar introduce something
called

157
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,890
car control so is a metallic hard like
the old school punch cards

158
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,310
and have little all holes in it that
would indicate

159
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:10,860
the the path from your location or your

160
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,130
your switch that you were connected to
to of or exchange it would say he's a

161
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,200
hockey meet a

162
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,130
overfill this is an alternate way to get
there okay

163
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:25,860
pop quiz thing frequency and
multi-frequency

164
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,370
were two different systems a go for
became personal frequency

165
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,430
what tone was critical in signaling

166
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:36,820
exactly

167
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,000
are in what was the design flaw

168
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,040
that revolutionize the industry put us
where we are today

169
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,490
that with me this is too easy

170
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:50,180
I got a bunch of reaching their so

171
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,530
briefing was around for a really long
time but the first

172
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:57,030
a awakening I guess for the general
public

173
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:01,050
was in 1971 in this article call secret
for the little blue box

174
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:05,020
and the offer specter of a long time
interviewing free

175
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:09,610
getting to know them and introduced
world to you guy such as joint Brescia

176
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:14,000
applying Freaker a you when by then

177
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,060
the name a bar handle joy Global's
towards the end mark Byrne a

178
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,570
John Draper a Captain Crunch on these
guys were not the first preachers and

179
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:22,950
many

180
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,490
many people myself included when I first
started getting involved way

181
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:30,390
I I always heard the Captain Crunch
whistle telling people that were started

182
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,070
rate

183
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,290
know it happened way before that on

184
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,630
is as early as phones were around when
they started using this type of

185
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,340
signaling

186
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,620
are exploring yes it will be 30 Korean

187
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,970
Donnelly Korea very crazy numbers and
working on a call

188
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,350
so a lot of people were doing it and are

189
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:52,120
those of us who were more enthused about
technology started like

190
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,550
listening and tones and a wonderful
recreate for the use of Doha

191
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:00,270
and eventually you tone generators and
things like that

192
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:03,460
and arm 10 the

193
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,850
for interesting cases was actually in

194
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,240
in on 59 60 time praying these three
guys

195
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,560
between Harvard MIT again like everybody
else they're playing around with

196
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,259
magnet takes first guy from MIT says I
can build a tone generator for that

197
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:23,740
and Dom the made a lot of calls wall
they happen to call in air force base

198
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,870
and that's when the FBI got involved

199
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:32,279
and you know they they were rule and you
know 1881 been prosecuted they thought

200
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,470
maybe they were aspiring or something

201
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:38,500
why they call in air force base 13 sure
there were no longer

202
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,380
against any of this and while they were
sternly warned in some other girl was

203
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,180
taken away

204
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,920
knew anything about it arm

205
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:52,290
you're taking over a bad he was a
pothead long time based

206
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:56,029
these days sirs so so there

207
00:11:56,029 --> 00:12:01,569
so there's fun stuff the you know many
free Kors with set up like a joke minor

208
00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:04,790
you know something interesting hook up
to the phone system but

209
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,829
that was technically Terms of Service
violation

210
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:11,889
because a the legal protections offered
to you AT&T the

211
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:15,930
for the National phone system it was
privately owned on

212
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:21,740
anybody know why why was it why wasn't
not allowed

213
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:26,170
to hook up something on your own

214
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,580
you could damage the fragile met were
and

215
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,940
one would wonder like if it's that
fragile than

216
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:36,330
maybe they should have been here really
in it wasn't fragile as was proven

217
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,060
repeatedly

218
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,310
on so that's kinda bit for my

219
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:43,330
my bring down on on history but

220
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:47,700
exploding the phone: by the lab seizures
in any this is offering

221
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,730
so

222
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:54,870
eventually freaking out shutdown in
really the thing that stopped that was

223
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:59,080
common channel in our office signaling
they said we have a problem how we can

224
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,870
fix this

225
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:03,720
they took the signaling into being in
band so you can actually hear

226
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,600
on they made it go on basically over
modems on a separate channel between the

227
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,540
two exchanges

228
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,840
that were involved in Syria calls so no
more

229
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,980
number for the middle tones and arm
personal computers came out

230
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,590
eventually allow the speakers got
involved in personal computing because

231
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:24,840
you know what's the next thing and it
was in the legal so they could do it

232
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:30,150
are not getting any rain yeah so
everybody a computer terminals and you

233
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,680
know PBS in the unit was developed so

234
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,830
you know freaking was illegal you can
get caught most it wasn't working

235
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,440
anymore anyway so

236
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,080
everybody turned in after beer after
right

237
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,460
so than then via the internet Nike

238
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,120
and you can start cramming things and
witnesses par the public my talk last

239
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,190
year you know you can

240
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:53,220
are for cram into over over IP

241
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,830
analog systems were still around and
people wanted to keep some other

242
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,660
investment so

243
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:03,990
are the manufacturers and the typical
cards that you could cram the Mac minis

244
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,560
to confer the IP

245
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,930
Voice over to analog you can still use
the old bones

246
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:14,459
and then as things evolve course
everything's going toward software

247
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:17,649
so now we have are completely I P

248
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:21,100
software PBS's saw clients so

249
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,990
you don't even need a handset anymore
and of course the virtualization

250
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,779
any one of us can set this up soldiers
orders a future

251
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:32,820
boy have school initial

252
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:37,270
Justin Timberlake inducing yesen

253
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:40,620
ports are inside web RTC yeah I mean

254
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,620
with liberty is the buzzword raising
culture its

255
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,529
its API the I'll voices open up to what
developers

256
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:51,600
so that's what we need is a voice
running for web browser exactly

257
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,620
you know a Cemal fives WebSockets and
all that garbage so

258
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,880
you know there's there's no set
signaling message

259
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,810
so it's it's a whole different you move
to your website

260
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:08,089
yeah see views

261
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:11,610
alright so you're not getting a brainy
per

262
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,649
they were not showing any weed right
away so we're gonna show some

263
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:17,720
some really cool stuff mostly the what
he did but

264
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,800
yes risking it give you some other
things are possible

265
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,079
yes there are still attacks and things
that are not recover

266
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,550
and don't come up to me it later ago
with you miss that now

267
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:31,399
not recover is too much all rights to it

268
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:34,839
how many people have heard lester's
school

269
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:38,350
quite possibly was awesome you you guys
in a little bit about is

270
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,830
made in 1909 bike Mark Spencer from

271
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:46,430
did you and GPO this is pretty pretty
cool stuff you

272
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:51,510
go on they are a name I which RESTful
interface management interface for

273
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:54,670
you can come to extend when you're
recalls

274
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:58,209
now the a GI is like CGI

275
00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:01,440
phone systems to use you call

276
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,700
any persist base voice or

277
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,070
done numbers they had a an extension I
would

278
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:12,570
when my pal I would on my home phone

279
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:15,589
comes back album appears you need

280
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:18,959
whose as Armani to

281
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,970
when have asterisk a kinda Bowl

282
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:26,190
David period on interviews you have a
bunch of variance

283
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:30,180
now say we had discussions over which
was the box

284
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:34,560
and we we figured out that I guess the
distributions

285
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,190
are box in this case for previous SEC

286
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:42,910
all those they all kinda tram wrapables
software into a package

287
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:46,420
from than so-so

288
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:50,740
you for the OS with has tried in a
military my own

289
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:54,040
and are possibly mister web browsing
interface on it

290
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,290
year and where you end up with you have
any worries

291
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:01,959
Angus someone usually seen idiocracy
where they just keep on piling garbage

292
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:03,010
open it or dislike

293
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:06,670
falls in Boston his lawyers apartment
Asus kind where we are

294
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:12,640
is gonna below so alright so now we're
gonna take me through several different

295
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,100
areas

296
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:17,880
in for each were gonna cover red team
with the red should or could do

297
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:23,050
and women with a new designer rice
information leakage

298
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:26,550
I systems designed to be used by
authorized parties

299
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:30,730
real usage equipment basically cool
stuff I can use packet later

300
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,830
added trickster yes so free

301
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,960
on the very first race because dialing
was

302
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,309
pick up the phone and talk to somebody
to make that happen they had to use

303
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,360
social engineering so

304
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,570
for war zone is in town wall at Anglia
people I was just for this morning it's

305
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:50,120
kinda busted but have time to determine
using am

306
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,140
anyways so the the

307
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:57,200
they would pretend to be phone tax you
know this is our test for 103 and I need

308
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,270
you to connect this call

309
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:02,320
to lines out were they would actually
believe it or not these hackers

310
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,640
girlfriends so they would if their
girlfriends to make the call for them

311
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,880
and take the phone and

312
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,760
you know continue their social
engineering arm in force there was only

313
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,170
one

314
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:15,280
one phone system so on my city TV before
v

315
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,240
was technically Bell before arm bob dole

316
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,840
with you know they had no reason my
guess in their mind why they couldn't

317
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,030
share this information

318
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:28,370
on how how awesome their network was
after the prenup these technical

319
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,309
journals were they were we laid out

320
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:31,950
how things were engineered in

321
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:36,539
that's how the first guys to build boxes
for those going to cause connelly

322
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:41,139
open source his exact values Hoosiers is
getting bad

323
00:18:41,139 --> 00:18:46,260
not all

324
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,360
not all night 1960 bill technical
journal had an article

325
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,779
that lead out the exact frequencies for
every single

326
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:58,850
pony generated it was les for one hacker
to go anywhere you go

327
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:02,850
him and I can't overclock Jerry and

328
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:07,299
you developers without now I'll

329
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:11,070
had to get information yep burns's but
now meanie

330
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:14,570
you can get a VM at home and play around
with it skin the interwebs and

331
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:18,210
by nike's port scanning third

332
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,269
yes it steps that go into OS
fingerprinting

333
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:24,380
extension enumeration where you dislike
sentiment but

334
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,580
invite basically is a all request

335
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,669
to every single extension number
possible 1,000

336
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:36,139
lol you in NC he will respond please go
to the website to see you

337
00:19:36,139 --> 00:19:41,419
what you can primary exactly like with
their HR number on the website

338
00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:44,460
in okay that's with their attention
range might be

339
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,630
so from Reggie perspective you know
there's all sorts of passive things you

340
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:49,120
can do

341
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,159
course Google searches showed an

342
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:56,070
and I got some samples there you know
the razor nimoy

343
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:59,970
yeah I now I know exactly what types
love exploits on my

344
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:03,190
you look for am just like any went
skinny

345
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:06,460
up to you arm the week signaling itself
is

346
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:10,070
their tax I'm yes I will show that so
you can actually give away

347
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:13,899
information about your environment
unwittingly arm

348
00:20:13,899 --> 00:20:16,940
if your internet-connected a quick

349
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,360
options or invite message there's that
methods

350
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,630
are in the system will respond back to
go years when I'm running

351
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:28,570
so this is what it looks like in a
course

352
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:32,059
in red there's there's some things that
will tell you maybe what you're actually

353
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:32,970
talking to

354
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:36,929
in its looks a lot like HTTP exactly so

355
00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:39,600
because it's it clear tax in a lot like
issue

356
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,360
EP are if you can somehow answer
yourself for the man in the middle

357
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,120
position

358
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:49,130
you can master this by running a proxy
and manipulate things change

359
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:53,160
chain were calls are going basically
perot I'll 11 call in with three way

360
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,919
call

361
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,600
send on its own you know into the call
things you can do

362
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,440
the difficulty of coral you know the
difficult part is

363
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,679
getting your man in the middle which can
deal with the fickle

364
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,010
me know maybe not yeah especially if
you're making a song

365
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:11,039
all the coffee shop on

366
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,740
yet other things like our own here's the
rounds on I know what you're running

367
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:20,090
and said still using some dark ages per

368
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:25,000
though SIP client authentication is
still using md5 so you capture enough

369
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,610
are hashes you can figure out what with
passwords are

370
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:31,919
on so from

371
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,110
from the info gathering perspective you
know scan the system with an map but

372
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:39,539
realize that somebody after a sports are
not actually getting the

373
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:44,100
people 40 min map so you have to specify
a white ford ranger at and

374
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:48,370
from a specific for Armida the course I
like the

375
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:51,740
show and ashes the options so you can
get something you're pretty in

376
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:55,390
figure out know what really with it
throwing on and

377
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:59,250
two-term fine I'll your in it you're
standing

378
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:03,120
especially you're doing your SIP
scanning can slow

379
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,159
so many systems have field running
working

380
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,800
were

381
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,480
thresholds for yet and too quickly

382
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,220
yeah they don't you just keep and are
vicious

383
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,330
isley used by 99 percent in the world
way

384
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:20,340
hacker attackers whatever but on

385
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:24,430
he's for keeping use it but most people
don't bother to go in and change

386
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:27,900
user-agent: so most manufacturers warsaw

387
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:33,200
taking friendly for the scanners in use
regional stop taking calls from a

388
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,370
no I drop it on

389
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:40,860
when you think that vicious or getting
it all look it

390
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,640
using other methods most from disuse
options so many manufacturers are

391
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,270
dropping

392
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:48,530
options message will be sent an invite
or cancel

393
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:51,880
might have more luck getting a response
in our Metasploit

394
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,230
reminds every field so you can try to
write checks

395
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:59,170
that will identify ho on getting skin
with this mess

396
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:04,290
mostly model right so I have them on
this

397
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:07,970
if I get home but we only cool arm

398
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,510
we do have i three tables will be bill
that will block

399
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:14,550
I'll were pretty decent hand for

400
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:18,130
the attack tool all the ones in Tally
are except for miss

401
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,430
or yeah miss way and a buncha other

402
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:26,120
knowing worms and mop so from a
different perspective

403
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,000
you want to you probably change your
user agent just a mess with people

404
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,870
sativa via make it something old

405
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,710
homie

406
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:38,230
block noon bad user agent so use those

407
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:41,640
others like tables rules newer versions
I'll

408
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,190
asterisk started including this always
all rejected yes option what that does

409
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:46,710
is

410
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:50,110
if somebody tries to you all same

411
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:53,240
send you message that's that's not all

412
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,630
Lee any

413
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:59,890
any register message that they send you
on a Mac it's an actor

414
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:03,900
so you're trying to New enumerate
extensions only get back as a month here

415
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,800
codes they're always the same and you
can't figure out what the extensions are

416
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,730
bill to ban an arm no

417
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:15,040
depending on how much money you have
actually look at an external clients

418
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,450
like

419
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:18,980
session border controller or something
that has set specific

420
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:23,780
protection alright so

421
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,580
than our service there's a kinda goes
government

422
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:31,100
yeah everybody knows lead of Israel are

423
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,320
the freaks that is this was an
interesting part for me was

424
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,130
like you never really hear about any
free are dos

425
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:42,750
stories because the freaks anything that
would call attention to the fact that

426
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,180
they're playing around with the network

427
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:48,450
was Lee you know pretty much

428
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:51,570
forbidden in the community nobody want
to call attention because then they're

429
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,070
gonna take our network away

430
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:58,880
we'll have anything to play with you
know dobrica toy so there was some

431
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,510
debate as to whether or not you could

432
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:03,690
back tandems where you basically making
a call bounce-back or

433
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:06,790
between two different phones which is
file

434
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:11,510
all the lines the third of a pack as the
network grew so much

435
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:17,350
passing it this really didn't matter
anymore so

436
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,639
nowadays are you know everything's gonna
the Internet

437
00:25:20,639 --> 00:25:24,830
especially disasters systems so it easy
just to

438
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:28,559
you don't get a cheap apartment
launching auto

439
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,899
fragmented you keep packets or what have
you a while

440
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:35,909
yeah overwhelm the PBX and arm

441
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:39,559
I spoke last year on something called
telephony dos you can actually make a

442
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:40,100
legit

443
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,169
phone call through a real service
provider and

444
00:25:43,169 --> 00:25:46,630
are high up there phone lines that way
so that often

445
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:49,870
to you so

446
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:53,450
alright if you gonna do this I you could
go with the

447
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:57,490
the gold standard shipping 3 yes you
could probably write something else to

448
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:57,970
do it

449
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:01,600
of the main on not very many

450
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,789
providers have actually implemented

451
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:08,250
party last or MPLS is used to secure

452
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:13,919
said in RTP basically station say that

453
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,110
the lessons for the SIP signaling SRTP
for the

454
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:22,909
audio and wrong many people have
implemented so if you do find a system

455
00:26:22,909 --> 00:26:23,639
it's running

456
00:26:23,639 --> 00:26:28,090
the less you can use this rth all RTC
episode of the hackers

457
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:31,120
choice and basically it just

458
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,289
tortures the the system I really go
shooting incursion parameters

459
00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:41,250
and then initial in process method word
so a lot of systems won't feel very well

460
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,980
with just some random

461
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:46,779
okay message alike but we don't have a
call going what is this for

462
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:51,529
and if so how that goes we will gain yet
machinations of what's going on

463
00:26:51,529 --> 00:26:54,779
where you set it apart well-trained just
random sequences

464
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:58,659
will or a second yet law

465
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:03,320
arm and then there some way least likely
things I I never really see this very

466
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:03,789
much

467
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:07,190
RCMP flooding where you just like
sending a bunch UP

468
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:12,469
at all their RTP ports or trying to send
by messages which is very difficult by

469
00:27:12,469 --> 00:27:13,379
the way because

470
00:27:13,379 --> 00:27:17,659
you have to have that mean the middle
position you get the long haul ID

471
00:27:17,659 --> 00:27:20,929
on in the IP's involved in all that were
do it

472
00:27:20,929 --> 00:27:25,409
and then causing a process crashing so
you get the like one shot one kill

473
00:27:25,409 --> 00:27:29,450
like attack usually you will see this
and in production is generally

474
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:33,259
father's sister obese Moss really gonna
follow the system in production

475
00:27:33,259 --> 00:27:37,149
mean can burn is Italy weeping why

476
00:27:37,149 --> 00:27:41,619
I'm attacking you re just paralysis and
their own

477
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:46,039
yet so I had a moment to on the only get
harder when I get is

478
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:49,599
up the the demo basically shows 7 by

479
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:54,509
word and HP free-spending gonna
fragmented GDP

480
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:58,009
and you see the sea I'm running part so
you can see the CPU just lay

481
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:05,009
by even away you know methanol that much
traffic so from a defense perspective

482
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:09,529
arm BCP 38 ever heard it's basically
just filtering

483
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:14,940
at your edge router on all the or C 1980
or or private IP space

484
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:18,080
some people actually use that as their
source address when the scoop it

485
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,149
so when it is filtered out right away

486
00:28:21,149 --> 00:28:25,669
are obviously run fielded and it will
help a little bit

487
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:27,960
IP tables will help a little bit

488
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,100
rules we have out there both on you know
the

489
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:36,530
spring that rules for the attacker pools
as well as rate-based

490
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:40,860
to try to keep the system for being
overwhelmed but

491
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:45,700
across the work are and eventually
you'll get overwhelmed if you don't have

492
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,030
something at the edge so

493
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:50,210
that where you need to look at something
like and SPC

494
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:53,720
are for your your age security or

495
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,780
something that will mitigate DoS attacks
exploitations

496
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:01,300
on stuff free you really need a
description over

497
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,470
was to go a wrister

498
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:11,010
break a system runs good say freaks used
in the inferno

499
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,070
yes and exploit people

500
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:17,230
and systems to to do

501
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:21,360
whatever the have much knowledge in
history freaking

502
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,830
but now exploitation yeah I mean if you
have a system out there

503
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,940
on the Internet or anywhere somebody

504
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:32,680
is told not only to try and break it
from

505
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:36,180
for-profit whatever so we're going to
use it

506
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:41,260
tricks boxcars is a really popular from
and it you can see

507
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:44,420
Marie I guess he smells of 5 stars

508
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:49,070
source for seniors quality software and
it was last updated we'll set

509
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:54,200
July June 2013 as five hundred dollars
we can sicken

510
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,410
pretty significant number if what temps
and at least

511
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:02,280
it on the internet as a bunch of Honor
abilities for

512
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:07,320
which makes onto mess around with you
will come across the city

513
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:11,380
for the demo we put it drank else

514
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:16,550
you is say

515
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:19,900
I really got them because

516
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:24,570
is just a pop-up if you should Jason's
to earlier sorry to connect assess

517
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:28,540
on from the management face and when you
move the mouse

518
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:33,170
that his new job description said its
some stop but this to cross it

519
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:36,250
set on a friend skating against the user
help so they'll

520
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:42,130
us escort so often the case that there's
a local file inclusion

521
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:46,160
that's kinda cool you can read

522
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:50,390
some interesting files on this is Lou
different ones

523
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:54,060
you read then than if you just wanna

524
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,140
on since sasser's people read PCM

525
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:00,520
42 and that's cool database password
some real

526
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,830
password you read astor's logs

527
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:08,930
generally people leave logging because
he was he with princess seams

528
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:11,980
so you can see what calls are in
progress

529
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:15,370
while in into your point about Davis
most

530
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:18,010
astor's this road

531
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:20,820
yeltsin the term remover access of

532
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:24,330
for so that that was kinda cool

533
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:30,120
they did local will be on common efforts
for me code execution

534
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,400
while by like the PHP input filter
ProCare

535
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,970
the so and the Apache Axis longer will
name to read those

536
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:42,380
farm something the

537
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:45,419
wasn't they I guess they didn't

538
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:50,150
thinkable was

539
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:53,470
yet during this window which one his
your

540
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:58,460
polls

541
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:02,690
0

542
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:08,940
only re: she the economy yes good

543
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:15,690
space bar

544
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:18,570
to the this is only

545
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:22,020
important so this is the a local funny
vision party

546
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:29,020
prickly so that's cool make it big so
you can see everything

547
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,280
in a region different

548
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,350
files like the CPU see well

549
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:42,470
a process for Maria I'm the

550
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:47,180
we read the asters long along though
this is another sip se

551
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:51,560
and I descended test message just kinda
see what happens

552
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:55,180
this is on of indicated from subside
nosy

553
00:32:55,180 --> 00:33:00,310
on I'll is believes that text me

554
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:07,310
featured in it p.m. for which is a
refund that

555
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:15,020
its kinda interested so I guess I didn't
think to

556
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:20,040
block access to the Astor injured

557
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,810
toledo's

558
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:27,700
so that was

559
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:31,370
wanna amenity that was the next one the
there's a on

560
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:34,800
video how weird so

561
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,880
there's also a a if you don't want to be
alone there's

562
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,270
give you a execution just by for in
there

563
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:49,940
there's a video so that's warm shared

564
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:54,110
this one say

565
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:59,680
going back to you at you

566
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,580
shit you good shell

567
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:10,580
I guess three

568
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,750
plan

569
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:18,710
as well as the ok fine or remote code
execution on an attack terrorists

570
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,579
through this sick

571
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:22,679
copy months ago maybe I'm lost here

572
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:26,559
see

573
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:29,839
you can just inject some show page mass

574
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:33,779
it works cool

575
00:34:33,779 --> 00:34:39,039
so from your shell you open up

576
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:43,139
when Nicholas no

577
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:48,960
this is the pie phone

578
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,440
the Panthers monkeys iPhone net cash 0

579
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,829
which is awesome is I like the pipe
along

580
00:34:56,829 --> 00:35:00,450
everywhere has five whole minutes just
seems to work well

581
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:07,450
login for the blogs rene smiley face

582
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:14,710
say

583
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:19,570
get back to you this so what it was a
kind

584
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:24,550
change all for you the stigma and this

585
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:28,430
achieve media taken from the Nexus S

586
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:33,550
use like a social engineering or

587
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:36,920
YouTube page a bunch of friends on it

588
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:40,010
just he did your information gathering

589
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:44,530
would you know what you'd

590
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:47,630
ovoid

591
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:54,630
screen re: a tutor

592
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:00,040
to Iceweasel Firefox windows open

593
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,070
once logged in I made

594
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:06,270
this page with the iframe say

595
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:09,760
this is kinda confusing and took a
little odd

596
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:15,210
in this house say no

597
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:19,610
it's a recording Harry yeah and reaching
the video for

598
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:26,610
bit like iron at the gym on Windows you
confusing me

599
00:36:30,859 --> 00:36:35,430
I don't we yelling

600
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:39,180
stand now difficult re:

601
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:43,599
where is it deserve you I can see

602
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,000
soon yeah

603
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,450
I don't have to use the mouse

604
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:55,780
I could about it had

605
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:59,130
computer yeah say

606
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:02,190
what is though that takes the iframe

607
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:05,830
and on mouseover it hides the iframe

608
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:09,349
and makes random request to the remote
code

609
00:37:09,349 --> 00:37:14,830
executions in America earlier year's
gonna be a record this time could inject

610
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:15,349
anything

611
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:19,640
sips to you going to get to see that
when you send this link to this page to

612
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,359
this

613
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:24,160
at noon has access to be maintenance

614
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,290
fortune the site niggas see this one is

615
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:31,369
on its approach credentials but when you

616
00:37:31,369 --> 00:37:36,080
send it to the this very fine shows no
actually there

617
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:40,369
tricky services the link

618
00:37:40,369 --> 00:37:45,040
Center new globe in and when the
macerated

619
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,670
kweisi it's here here's the mouse is
over

620
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:52,570
using grab the show within the system
when the mouse is over

621
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:56,520
makes a request does the system call to
put the shell

622
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,990
on the system and you have to actually
put it in the current directory

623
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:03,260
because if it is right that the same

on mouseover and replaces pay 60 for
which the bay 64 is

635
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,510

00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,359
has come from so have

639
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:03,619
how do you defend against like this of
you have any web people do we have any

640
00:39:03,619 --> 00:39:07,180
one least say

641
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:11,610
how do you fix cross-site scripting

642
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:14,510
yes how would you fix this cross site
scripting

643
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:18,460
alright implementation I'm

644
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:22,920
this in the intro into the elevation so
how do you fix the alibi

645
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,980
input validation

646
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:30,390
or making sure kinda your ability to
redirect

647
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:33,960
earlier so they're all the same and it
has one-line

648
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,830
this is while and

649
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:40,910
if you don't match their I'm just gonna
see you English

650

your language is English even in the
second example

651
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,470
this light is wrong so that it yeah we
can fix it

652
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:52,170
so that's how you think it is it's not
that bad

653
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:55,950
whoever is over doesn't care been

bill secure software say you can avoid

656
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,800
ulam one distributions as as really good

657
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:12,340

anything clue too much stuff you don't

658
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:12,960

665
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:38,320
and if you do you have to configure the
effort you know what it is

booking

685
00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:01,150
that the mafia ran rate because they had
to be getting a line all the time in

686
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:04,820

692
00:42:24,859 --> 00:42:28,069
and make free phone calls because it
sounded like the quarters are grown in

693
00:42:28,069 --> 00:42:28,420
the

694
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:32,210
I like that they're box seen as and
think it wasn't

695
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:36,109
real what I thank you levels on the over
and

696
00:42:36,109 --> 00:42:40,140
were what the actually focus the FBI and

697
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:43,440
after handicapping broach wouldn't do
that really take them off

698
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,020
you

699
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:50,140
he found are that he could actually

700
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:54,059
listen in on their phone calls and
records and phone calls

701
00:42:54,059 --> 00:42:57,200
FBI agents talking one other talkin

702
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,829
no external agencies dollar and it was
just one of those

703
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:05,680
heaters a box in that exchange you're
really office that I can

704
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,849
use it was like a tough box or something
so I can ago

705
00:43:08,849 --> 00:43:12,460
the line in the sand so

706
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:16,190
I spoke last year on how to make money
fast using on PBS

707
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:19,599
so from a broad perspective I'm not
gonna over that ground again

708
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:23,700
but international revenue sharing on
where you compromise the PBS make a

709
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,619
lotta calls

710
00:43:24,619 --> 00:43:27,950
and split the profit with the person
getting

711
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:32,730
getting the call really Bay on you can
be enabled with

712
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:36,809
are you know horny were up with milled
I'll

713
00:43:36,809 --> 00:43:39,880
that sort of thing are on one that

714
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,960
that I also way as could be used

715
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,039
as as an enabler for social engineering
is

716
00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:49,059
something called back quickly been
around for a long time but

717
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:53,549
UBS you missed by so many people just
don't realize how easy it is to be

718
00:43:53,549 --> 00:43:58,700
of already you can't this early phase
the main display very easily

719
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,789
but you can't fake

720
00:44:00,789 --> 00:44:03,900
number from number that phone company
receives

721
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:07,609
so if you can change that in you know
like I wanna

722
00:44:07,609 --> 00:44:10,710
look like made in America popping up on
somebody's display

723
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:14,489
she's making America's 1 800 number with
that

724
00:44:14,489 --> 00:44:18,160
0 make American it works especially well
with voices

725
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,140
oh yeah Zoe so we were your having fun
last night

726
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:29,140
got questions yeah

727
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:39,160
I exactly

728
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:56,730
yeah you could definitely send

729
00:44:56,730 --> 00:45:02,740
damage numbers with you yeah if

730
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:06,250
its it's pretty interesting though when
you see that they took the care

731
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:11,990
time to make it look legit yeah exactly

732
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:16,150
so ago a couple examples of this on
phone

733
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:19,570
I how many UNC basketball fans we have
here portable

734
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:22,620
I know support for hacker con I love you
so

735
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:26,110
the backstories are were 10 the

736
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:29,810
when the guys are either hand with the
coaches name for UNC

737
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:33,790
basketball Roy Williams right okay

738
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:38,200
so your choices graceland

739
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:42,220
as I didn't already make this

740
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:45,860
double-click title you go alright

741
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:51,000
so Facebook you can see here this

742
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,900
outbound caller ID is quality videos
yeah this is the field

743
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:59,220
yeah I'm taking it with my android phone
trying to look at it and whatever you'll

744
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:01,160
see why it's important arm

745
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:05,940
so that on known I'm sending our caller
name is unknown because it doesn't

746
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,270
matter to get overwritten

747
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:11,720
your are telephone carriers kind enough
to look at the number that's calling you

748
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,020
know I know what that is

749
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,590
they do a database that and they pull
out the name in them

750
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:20,030
descended on your place if we right the
kindly replaces so

751
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:23,970
basically what I've done as I said if I
make an outbound call from this PDS

752
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:28,340
extension I want to tell the phone
company that I'm using this number down

753
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:29,240
here so it's

754
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:33,570
to advertise a different number so what
happens

755
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:36,980
my friend has a caller ID on his TV

756
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:42,670
Inoue the basketball game is on Android
Williams is calling for Android

757
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:46,000
could could you imagine if you're a bar
in a game was good I'm bad and they had

758
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,650
the caller ID on the TV and you did

759
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:54,650
you can you has a lot of people your
other option was graceland could've

760
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,280

administration actually has like no
reserve loss for

779
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:06,940
the area codes that were familiar with
but some others

780
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:10,260
area codes are really our area codes the

781
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:14,800
also cover Caribbean islands and they
are all high cost destinations

782
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,980
so you need to go actually implement not
just in 2011 band but also

783
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:23,330
one list about of 15 or so

784
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:27,040
prefixes in there I have a a with those

785
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:30,270
in the presentation and so you Gravatar
get home %um

786
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:33,320
grip your logs to see made any calls to
this

787
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:36,490
exactly and you know certainly

788
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:43,490
yeah

789
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:55,220
all

790
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:55,910
exactly

791
00:48:55,910 --> 00:49:02,910
where

792
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:18,500
Europe rate exactly

793
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:23,060
then

794
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:27,590
a lot of love providers actually have
fraud protection so they can actually

795
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:28,490
warn you

796
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:31,810
when you know you're my provider call

797
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:35,410
made a call to me it was like you make
number phone calls to

798
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:39,820
London last week new it to somebody
who's

799
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:44,630
dying in a hotel randomly cost me .20
cents so is liable for

800
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:49,000
they it could have been a lot worse so

801
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,550
are couple measures disable call
forwarding I mean

802
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:56,590
most people in business environment
don't really need it arm

803
00:49:56,590 --> 00:50:00,650
we all have mobile phones & people just
nope they're out there in a playable

804
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:06,360
anyways on we spill in conference bridge
it's also not have the ability to dial

805
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,440
found so

806
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,620
somebody can crack your voicemail pin
and make phone calls from the PBS

807
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:14,940
so you can always passion along number
from

808
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:18,550
action from the airline a 2-2 record the
conference on

809
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:21,580
with on you know

810
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:25,630
set up a pin code for long distance
dialing on me these

811
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:28,840
systems you can actually dialed the are
than

812
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:32,270
we're trying to get to internationally
and mineral property for the or five

813
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:32,940
digit PIN

814
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:37,220
really easy yes you can even put it up
on a sticky note beside your monitor in

815
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:37,980
the SMB

816
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:41,420
breaking get it by at least it harder

817
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:45,109
are transport layer security

818
00:50:45,109 --> 00:50:50,130
30 P you know a lot of people will not
implement the last because

819
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:55,500
its accord creationism a person's heart
and I can't diagnose what's going on

820
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,109
because it's imprinted in

821
00:50:57,109 --> 00:51:00,369
I if you want to do mutual
authentication

822
00:51:00,369 --> 00:51:03,869
where your your crypto Kb downgraded

823
00:51:03,869 --> 00:51:08,539
menus like Albany his analyze this is
too hard so you know what

824
00:51:08,539 --> 00:51:12,359
I a shortcut yeah it's it's not 100
percent secure

825
00:51:12,359 --> 00:51:16,269
but issue one certificate and just put
it on every phone in hand

826
00:51:16,269 --> 00:51:20,190
out every user and okay its compromise
and figure out

827
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:23,589
yes we have had a but at least you're
starting from something it's a little

828
00:51:23,589 --> 00:51:24,539
bit more secure

829
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:28,700
on and then of course if you got lots of
cash

830
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:32,130
and lotsa risk I actually look it

831
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:35,609
a real fraud management system that can
monitor your voices

832
00:51:35,609 --> 00:51:38,700
and look for bass lines look for changes
in

833
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:41,829
your truck pattern like why there are so
many calls

834
00:51:41,829 --> 00:51:46,170
going out three and every day you know
the the things that were really

835
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:51,079
without a other usual yes alright

836
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:56,220
that's it that's our get however you can
download thanks
