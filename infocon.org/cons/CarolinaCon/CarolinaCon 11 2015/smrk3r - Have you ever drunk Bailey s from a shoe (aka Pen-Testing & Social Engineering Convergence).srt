1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,780
out welcome to the last Carolina Khan as
we know it

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,669
I am very pleased to be here again love
coming to Carolina con

3
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:11,259
I'm for a number of reasons man with her
ass pic

4
00:00:11,259 --> 00:00:15,719
and slim best thing you can do this so
ever drink Baileys from a shoot us a

5
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:16,190
quick

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,630
Pew study anybody ever drink Baileys
original one yet to

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,180
also we can do about that so

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,289
hi glad you're all here

9
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:30,029
if I ever heard he'd raring not her you
drink good

10
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:34,649
so basically you drink is this idea
where you get to drink during a talk

11
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,170
and it's two o'clock socially acceptable
on weekends right

12
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,360
and in the spirit old Gregg

13
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,629
we have are sweet salty bayless

14
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:51,500
creamy screaming and I i did.

15
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,260
buy some shoes should I got some

16
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,309
all I foods and

17
00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:01,780
some Baileys so essentially

18
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,610
there's a lot of things going on here
you drink the thing that I like to do in

19
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:05,229
talks

20
00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:10,590
I normally I have a sweet handle the
delivery of drinks for me

21
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,840
and fortunately she inquire I were able
to make it this year

22
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,430
and I'm not gonna replaced squeak so
basically the rules for you drink are

23
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:22,520
threefold you one drink have to be 21

24
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:28,179
has to be bailey's you get a drink at
issue

25
00:01:28,179 --> 00:01:31,750
so

26
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,830
like some fair game anytime

27
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,979
no bra pink bombings however first taker

28
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:42,800
Obama's others to shoes

29
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:49,160
though past

30
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,690
we're having thriving old Gregg
communion so just

31
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:57,780
come as the Spirit leads you know the
drill

32
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,920
so

33
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,229
Co

34
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:08,740
it works out nicely now it's brand new

35
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,120
come out we have audio my on my al

36
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,970
and in tech that on my PC its board then

37
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,180
I lapd

38
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,050
though

39
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,680
need to continue using really you to the
moon

40
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,460
compared to come down drop the holy fire
on a burn

41
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:37,460
backed up that's not me I unless he
really is

42
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,990
but if you if you use keno any

43
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:44,320
at a new slide he's the stock photo so
figure

44
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,670
sure so I'm a husband a father a man on
astrologers

45
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,910
because I felt like that was completely
relevant to my talk to all you should

46
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,390
know about her latest and

47
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:58,780
I'm a red pen tester ID red team gauge
went on with bail and really who is this

48
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,300
dude now has another child

49
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,420
the alright so

50
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,720
I'm on site a client engagement

51
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,280
dumb I rekon as you all do and I'm

52
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,990
I'm aware that in an unmarked building
across the street from the main

53
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:18,490
facility that a call center belongs to
this this company and

54
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:22,390
my goal is to get in and do something

55
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,480
really didn't know what the goals are
going to be system access was ideal

56
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,310
anything beyond that was kinda given
we're testing process is right

57
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,660
so to get my phone i'm talking away on
just talking to myself

58
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,239
allow this time start pulling on doors
there's three door to start the backbone

59
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:39,890
the first one

60
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:42,890
phone sacrament for their own by the
time I get to the thoroughness nice lady

61
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,090
over that can help you sir

62
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,260
yeah I got a I walked right past her
rent a call center

63
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,870
the classical the bathroom real quick
I'll be right back price goes and about

64
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,180
their

65
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,510
cuz you know wanna text my wife hates it

66
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,939
bathrooms causing her head

67
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:01,620
was I go out wash my hands you know
trying to keep up the drill

68
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,329
I didn't actually use the bathroom but
you gotta you know if you're selling a

69
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:04,980
celery

70
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,489
to head out to sea on the back of the
actual bathroom doors a seating chart

71
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:12,810
for the whole call center everybody's
name

72
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,590
everybody's email address supervisors
names phone numbers

73
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:21,269
all kinds a good information so I might
I'll go see Linda

74
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,860
discuss era when is that walk down talk
to Heather

75
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,940
she's there on the road doctor now
they've tera

76
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,820
hey is when the here that matches are
left are like this and stop light in a

77
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,840
problem so i sat down

78
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,870
I don't know what I'm gonna do yet I've
got some

79
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,889
payload in my pocket as you do I

80
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:42,590
fortunately linda was nice enough to
leave your password on a sticky note on

81
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:45,870
monitor for me so a sit-down

82
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,110
login is Linda up link fires up

83
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:53,180
call help death was like hey we're
checking in on that ticket follow all of

84
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,400
it like well you know it

85
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,800
it's not picked up yet but I gotta head
out are taken tomorrow

86
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,490
to you know they lack shelhah machine
you know

87
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,030
this tradition of the machine walk out
the door

88
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:09,289
whatever challenging that happen to us

89
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:13,940
at the ones we all want to do one other
usually look like well we have

90
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,409
you know three weeks worth getting
authorization hopefully our sales guys

91
00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:19,180
handle that for some the consultant
world

92
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,720
if you're in the big business world
doing ready me you typically get a

93
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,150
handle all that your cell

94
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:28,340
that's not fun check shirt a scopes
right because you don't want some others

95
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,669
to stop being mad at your testing his
top and so the other guys stop

96
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:35,030
I you run your Nessus can you know you
tried at

97
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,659
less as these wonder red nearly all the
fancy want to see if that works

98
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:43,099
you hope it works it might not you look
at the medians good you're supposed to

99
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:46,120
be the right field to a talk to tell you
chain these things together

100
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,139
so you liked the meantime people I think
they're know what you're talking about

101
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,580
us a look at these I look at an hour to
do with that

102
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,940
you make a chart executives love charts

103
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,590
for the report have you done so
basically in a remote abilities

104
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:03,230
make a chart bite on back option

105
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,790
or more like this if you prefer

106
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,090
graphs and charts got a doc

107
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,710
right will why is this a problem well a
minute

108
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:16,050
try to develop this out over the course
of the next 45 minutes and show that

109
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:20,140
this typeof scanner oriented assessment
has its place

110
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,560
absolutely necessary as a pen test

111
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,320
probably not very helpful I'll not to
say that everything should be contested

112
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,200
all the time

113
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,320
there are some very serious security
concerns should be come out from a

114
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,150
a contest in perspective but a lot of
times a week call pen test

115
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:39,910
and actually being just a bone scan you
write a chart

116
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:44,310
because gonna have a chart that's what
repaid what I want to put is more

117
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,500
towards as a model

118
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,190
up in testing and a model love
adversarial modeling

119
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:52,620
it was a little bit more like this where
is the first one

120
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,730
it's pretty heavy on these two chunks

121
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:00,120
West restart the level this out
exploitation face

122
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,430
their in into being actually quite small

123
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:07,060
not just on a much crap at 'we're
figured out where we wanna go when

124
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,260
it may not have anything to do with what
the vulnerability scanner says: turns

125
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:10,810
out

126
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:14,310
we can disagree with the vulnerability
scanner life in New that

127
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,060
sometimes you have to just bide the
management funny ways because they think

128
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,320
that their calls the point is the best
thing under heaven

129
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,510
but when you can start taking over
things the college then fine

130
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:28,800
then they start to listen but all that
happens in these sort of perspectives

131
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,160
all these things go towards this
analysis

132
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,530
getting and then you've spent a lot of
time doing this stuff

133
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,630
why because that's how attackers do it

134
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:42,150
we're not doing any good to accompany if
we go n

135
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:45,310
run as a scanned page other stuff we've
all heard that right we've all heard

136
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:45,790
this

137
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,920
that's kinda or the same and one saying
here

138
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,700
I'll to back that up some more we have
our charts when your charge but if you

139
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,780
can show biz impact there what you've
got hold of

140
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,699
thats but obviously way more Bible the
area

141
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:03,069
so what do we do this I think they're
actually couple problems

142
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:07,069
and a couple ways we cannot solve that I
but essentially we

143
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:11,090
we've gotten really good and numerate
ing bone abilities

144
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,259
at least we think we've gotten really
good upon in memory on abilities

145
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:17,270
we think our scanners are really good at
it we think water standards tell us

146
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,219
we're gonna tell us everything we need
to look at

147
00:08:19,219 --> 00:08:23,650
and as such we tend to rely on that and
if we don't have any high findings

148
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:27,460
well then okay where k gonna be at least
mostly okay

149
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:31,530
some works they only deal with the high
findings on a medium in a bone scan

150
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:36,550
now maybe not deal with that but i by
nature would go that route

151
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:40,060
and the problem with that is the gaps

152
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:44,190
rape if you only go with of what your
scanner tells you

153
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,640
you're not gonna see things that the
scanners gonna tell you are not going to

154
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,029
tell you

155
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:51,610
one other won the favor with I like to
demonstrate this is learn Japanese

156
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,200
Trustwave

157
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,230
random an amazing toward in Python
responder and

158
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:59,570
responder simply sits on the network
promiscuous mode looks for hi

159
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,980
in the BIOS and Ellen are broadcast
requests

160
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:08,100
sees those all our your CCNA guys what
happens if it's a broadcast request you

161
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,990
can reply to Bart broadcast requests

162
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,339
everybody so you do yeah that's me

163
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:16,899
while Windows is nice enough that if if
that if it connects to that

164
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:20,860
listening opposed to say that may and
issued a challenge

165
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,870
owners is likely here go out on a log
into that no problem to get a tax write

166
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,370
cool thing no scanners ever gonna check
that

167
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:31,930
not that I've seen yet you have a way to
tunis candidacy

168
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,940
broadcast net buyers request cool

169
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,269
and always shutting it down but you know
there's gonna be some gaps there is just

170
00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:39,699
an example above ways that

171
00:09:39,699 --> 00:09:45,320
things are gonna happen back in our call
centre example what calls deployments

172
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,399
gonna keep me from walking into a call
center

173
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:51,540
sitting down on the computer still a
pastor of a person

174
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,350
than down doing things nothing don't
think they're the end-all

175
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,480
is another one so now the client-side

176
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,949
their I this was a little bit trickier

177
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:06,350
they're using I basically the best

178
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,150
current RFID systems you can buy

179
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,980
I their in cryptic cards their clonal

180
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,160
but the way they trying to combat the

181
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,670
the clone ability of them as a deal with
two-factor things so

182
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:24,650
when you badge in picture a pop up on
the screen so you're outside the door

183
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:27,910
there's a little pedestal the rear badge
in

184
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:33,100
it beeps if your valid the door opens
security guards sitting inside the door

185
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,290
sees your picture pop up on the monitor
checks you in the face

186
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:40,680
and says okay you're good each person
that comes in scenario up against

187
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,040
Michael

188
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,050
get in the building bypass Mac

189
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,360
pop some machines walkout

190
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,010
don't call last one most important and
we watched Dexter roll 1 roll to

191
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:55,370
same for reading at a

192
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:58,790
deal with a letter uva indemnification
bacall

193
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:03,280
personally so I figure out you know do
Marie concert in the parking lot a

194
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:03,770
morning

195
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:07,780
Mike you know calling about is not gonna
help me much

196
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:12,330
so I just think I want to be the new guy
I'm gonna be this new guy he's down

197
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:16,500
visiting from another office I'll make
up the story that works

198
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,880
based on officially issue government ID
is that I have

199
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,170
I have the typeof bad that they use

200
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:26,410
even though it's not programmed
correctly fun thing about most bad

201
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:26,900
system

202
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,330
if you use have the batch that they use
and swipe it

203
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:33,390
it'll be regardless of whether or not
its ballot

204
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,620
so if you're walking in with the whole
stream a people

205
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,520
person pretty decent report you can
build immediately just by being in a lot

206
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:40,950
of people

207
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,150
beeping a card they don't pay second
attention to you so

208
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:48,220
I get in line we all walk in by this guy
he holds the door for me is relies on

209
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:48,470
them

210
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:52,420
finally get through forget about three
steps past the security guards to stop

211
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:52,700
me

212
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,890
certainly see your bat horribly saying
here on my bell

213
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,920
I am ironically the company that I used

214
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,200
has some red in their logo so I had a
fake badge and actually taken my Lego

215
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,000
Club card flip it over

216
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,260
state that in the past two so it had you
know from a distance it had some red

217
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,660
that make and make them assume it's
right you know just trying to make it

218
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,550
believable enough

219
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:17,290
i holed up she's like wilde's have a car
with your picture on it

220
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:21,000
I look better I've gotta love those yet

221
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:28,000
through an upright in

222
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,050
all that we heard earlier a it about
acting it was not party you in it it's a

223
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,110
lot sus

224
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:40,399
creative she says okay

225
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:46,429
as get good the practice so many that's
step one takes

226
00:12:46,429 --> 00:12:49,600
yeah it was that was spooky as we're
gonna get to

227
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,639
I feel nervous you know I had the lake
be one of the lake

228
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:58,149
think that is I get a lower I can keep
my composure down good on the inside

229
00:12:58,149 --> 00:12:58,899
only just

230
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:02,619
turmoil so again go to the bathroom
recurring theme here

231
00:13:02,619 --> 00:13:07,079
actual use that this time %uh its
mandate

232
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:11,679
for myself but so i sat down hang out
about them for a little while

233
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,100
and their Scotland reasons I do that one
has to calm myself down

234
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,619
the other is if you come out of the
bathroom you're supposed to be there I

235
00:13:18,619 --> 00:13:22,489
the Cougars work crew goes into a
building it takes a dump

236
00:13:22,489 --> 00:13:28,480
through the their dude that

237
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,730
well the other problem I ran into was
that every dollar in the facility

238
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,430
was also bashed write a all Melbourne
giving a talk on

239
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:40,360
you know paddle think about electrical
engineering and approaches to

240
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,140
I your Mac lock systems and you know
there may have been some vulnerabilities

241
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,020
in that system but I couldn't very well
I climb up on a ladder and start and

242
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:50,040
screwing things and doing it right so I
figure well

243
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,779
I'm just gonna have to tailgate at the
entire time I'm in here and

244
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:57,320
denied so I did like others for Senate
or some wandering around

245
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,350
probably looking completely nuts
hopefully selling the new guy

246
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:05,149
the other thing the new guy does the new
guy always over dresses

247
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:08,470
so mostly employees there in you know

248
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:12,209
call you know callers polos or whatever
and jeans and

249
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:17,740
I show up I got my expressed extra slim
serve ice caps slacks and some pants

250
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,899
and I'm totally own way or dress for the
done on the Tigers on my way release for

251
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:22,380
the man

252
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:27,290
even if I'm pretending but but that's
the whole cell array there's these

253
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:29,709
little bitty things you gotta pay
attention to and put these things

254
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:30,620
together

255
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,520
so ahead through a door there's a nice
banker

256
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,990
cubicles right here on the front the
building and adult porn

257
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,520
465 seven year old lady she looks like
she's been there since

258
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:47,490
nor and she's trying to go through the
door in like she's got copy and books

259
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,350
and her laptop and let me help

260
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:53,310
thus will be with us by holder coffee
hold the door for her

261
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,470
she's like thank you so much I saved her
morning

262
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:00,630
she would have had coffee all over his
head on home they were lost money

263
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:03,940
i was just curious you know occupy
myself on the back on our

264
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:08,470
will she lets me ride and coercive ish I
why not so

265
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,640
I walk around I'll find a cube that the
phone appears to be forwarded

266
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,459
some like okay that's fine I just sat
down here the Mac I was suppose to

267
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:17,120
bypass

268
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,000
now and then a so plugin the ACP

269
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,730
run responder still creds cracked them
while I'm there

270
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:28,200
pops machines

271
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,340
stand-up get my phone out take pictures
just

272
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,570
where cue train shot close-up go to walk
out well

273
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:39,240
again the doors are bashed about 10:30
at this point because I've been in the

274
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,620
building for two hours and

275
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:47,350
well on all there's nobody around so I'm
stock in between these two doors locked

276
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:52,210
can't get back into the cubicle room
block there's a kitchenette sorta things

277
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,840
are probably could've hung out there

278
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,450
but my main concern was I don't wanna go
past the guard that I'd come in

279
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:01,320
from I I thought surely she like called
somebody

280
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,520
and was like an hour this guy came
through been quite feel right

281
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:10,220
you know I I S I just the wheel as a
last resort I just didn't want to go to

282
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:10,560
there

283
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,660
well it was my only option though I go
back

284
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,460
walk faster don't make eye contact in
say anything

285
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:20,900
leave the building walk across the
street got get

286
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,930
this is the pen testing we all like to
do all the contest we want to do

287
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:28,250
we're gonna talk about some things
related to doing that but again today

288
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:33,150
ties back to Purdue in circular loops
gimme an SS kantor

289
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:36,780
it that's gonna show you the gaps and
processes

290
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:40,170
from the parking lot two shells

291
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:45,310
in the building to leaving to actually
give you a full adversarial model

292
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:50,660
not gonna do it I don't have any time
even configure in nasa's policy for that

293
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,210
nonsense I didn't know what I was going
to do and I got there and didn't have

294
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,530
the luxury of effing out as I want

295
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,379
well and the

296
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:02,239
words of the great loss role greg is now
was a little man peach

297
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:05,459
I think another problem drives

298
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:09,909
drives what we're doing only me insist
so much on using our scanners

299
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:14,120
and and wanting to restrict the
creativity of summer contest there's has

300
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,870
compliance drives a lot of our security
models I'll

301
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,899
we've we've talked about this ad nauseam

302
00:17:20,899 --> 00:17:24,870
but my summer is going to be I don't
think appliances completely terrible

303
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:28,059
because if it without it certain organs
would be doing nothing

304
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:31,919
so it sometimes it's better than nothing
I

305
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,779
but it's not the same thing as a proper
security program you can have a

306
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:39,049
compliance program that has nothing to
do with your security program

307
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:43,309
and probably should if you do in your
security program correctly

308
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:46,840
a lot on the nuts and bolts on the
security side our compliance I'd take

309
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,580
care of itself

310
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,690
the other is that we have this idea of
postulates versus proof

311
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:55,669
and this is more where I am you know
complain about vendors and

312
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:58,750
and hocus pocus and couldn't pin good
marketing

313
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,260
if we believe on I guess I a good case
in point

314
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:06,419
on being a lot picker you know I like
the look at locks it's just the nerdy

315
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,370
thing that will come see with their so I
was at Walmart

316
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:13,610
it's been a while but walking down the
hardware I only got locked up right in

317
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:16,440
the gut Master Lock 30 body seemed
little blue and

318
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,940
we put on people's hands like as soon as
they walk into a building every like big

319
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,289
village in the country as Master Lock
three is good

320
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:25,580
releasing the open well on the front is
packaging

321
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:29,110
and big block red letters there's

322
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:33,269
says high-security and there's a scale
from one to 10

323
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:37,850
and then read this one to six like its
kinda interesting

324
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,899
probably not what I that have as a six

325
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:45,320
but it's one of those things where you
know if you're ever like presenting

326
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,960
to executives and trying to like deal
with this concept

327
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,789
and you know how to pick locks I found
it to be very effective to take one of

328
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:54,139
those fresh pac-10

329
00:18:54,139 --> 00:18:57,539
and make sure they see where it says
high-security and then pick it while

330
00:18:57,539 --> 00:18:59,320
it's still in the package and take it
out

331
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,500
because this is the idea this package
says

332
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,590
high-security hopefully we know better

333
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,850
but how will we know better and to
improve it for those

334
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,060
excuse me for being a sigh

335
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:14,830
into sort of things like we want proof
for the things that we're say

336
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:19,020
perfectly fine to have that approach to
things not everybody likes it

337
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:22,130
the astrologer certainly dole by

338
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:26,400
you know you can say a lot of things but
what you can actually prove

339
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,190
is a whole different ballgame and I
think sometimes we the forget that

340
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,740
ignored altogether or we just rather
drink Baileys from issue

341
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:40,440
cell so I think there's there's

342
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,620
there some there's two parts the blame I
think red teams are to blame I think

343
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,630
blue tumors are to blame

344
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:48,560
I think one of the problems we really
all have his is learning to communicate

345
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,680
within our organization I think we
mostly good at talking to each other

346
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,770
I I think conferences like this in the
abundance of conferences like this is a

347
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:00,270
good thing and it helps us have those
social interactions that

348
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:04,020
sometimes we struggle with I but reality
is

349
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:08,110
we end up being very focused on
minimizing the presents a boner

350
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:08,770
abilities

351
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:13,040
if we can get a clean Qualis can new
we'd sleep better at night with me

352
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:18,310
i win I'm sorry I as far as the red
teaming side is concerned

353
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:22,900
you know we we a we need to quit
replying our scanners as much you're

354
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,310
gonna have to do it you're gonna have to
understand urging that no use on any

355
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:30,270
rely on its okay the reality is your
fancy attackers

356
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,770
them and they might be using Metasploit
community but they aren't using

357
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:38,790
Wallace so a Woods was trying to get a
more realistic perspective in the ID on

358
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:42,860
this is to do the post exploitation
stuff is to do the stealth stop

359
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:47,630
its to let's not right all of our white
papers and stop there

360
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:51,830
if I can say all right I know I can
clone a badge

361
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:55,530
I know that I can walk into a building
with that bad

362
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:58,970
plug into the network and get the ACP or

363
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:02,690
even I have a bad in some cases and then

364
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:06,930
start doing things orders are blue team
on that weller blue teams looking for

365
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,860
the same stuff the red team is set up
and said this is what we need to be

366
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,630
looking for

367
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:14,030
at the red team's been saying well
here's our scanner traffic here's our

368
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,210
packet captures right signatures for
that

369
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:19,820
and they don't even know about other
stuff or as a red teamwork

370
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,160
doing a huge disservice to any of our
defensive

371
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:27,810
by coworkers and colleagues by telling
the look for things that an actual

372
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:30,180
attacker is never going to do

373
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:33,270
so we have to wrap this up

374
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:36,450
but this is a hacker con o'clock mixtape

375
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:40,610
today

376
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,020
so

377
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:45,010
I want to talk about Red Team stuff
because as the ACA

378
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:48,650
that's all i got sorry the problem with
that

379
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:52,250
and I think Dave over overcame this
really well earlier

380
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:56,290
trying to tell people how to do social
engineering is like telling people how

381
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:58,380
to walk down the hallway with your best
friend

382
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:04,780
paper towels Lake that's about as absurd
as it comes out I i love reading

383
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,950
social engineering forums and books and
just seeing what other people are

384
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:08,870
talking about

385
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:12,370
you wanna see an example love this
typeof explaining difficulty

386
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:15,710
I take a look at this the social
engineering some read it

387
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:20,570
and then promptly unsubscribe from it

388
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:25,220
because he did all fall in like I hate
to be one of those guys it's like just

389
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:25,680
one

390
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:29,020
to bit at the problem instead of being a
solution but I'm totally gonna be one

391
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,970
very happily

392
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:34,210
it's a real bad and I think we can fix
that but the trouble is it really is

393
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:37,030
complicated were explaining soft
sciences here

394
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:40,780
and I hate even saying that because it's
of Science no hard science not really

395
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,280
science

396
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,430
again all that psychology is weird
though and and

397
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:47,800
ever and I were having this discussion
earlier about there's like this

398
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,570
idea intuitive knowledge that's really
tough for us that want a lot approved to

399
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:53,300
come to grab

400
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,300
but like if anybody saw all the all
Ralph put on

401
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:00,430
images that went around worry job in
Second Life and people were having

402
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:04,650
intimate moments in Second Life missus
little short green troll

403
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:09,000
any just walkin stand there and whoever
started with a trout please go

404
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,550
any to say no in like

405
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:16,230
I I feel a there's a lot I hate saying I
feel like this

406
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:21,870
at Arkansas largest but I think
psychology and repeated

407
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:26,770
experimentation can show that there's a
lot that we understand about that

408
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:30,040
that we can't vocalize very well so

409
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,110
I love hearing talks about social
engineering and dealing with hearing

410
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,560
things in dealing with that sort of
thing and I'm actually gonna carry on

411
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,580
with that because you know I'm telling
stories about

412
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:41,290
walking in the buildings and then doing
my network contest

413
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:45,000
its it's fine it's really exciting but
like

414
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,920
some people think you're Jason Bourne
reality is probably aren't right

415
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,160
so story time here we go this is my
third and last story and then we'll get

416
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,600
into

417
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,900
soft sciences and there's plenty
available either so

418
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,260
into a large stay

419
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,650
so if you were to cut alaska in half

420
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,450
this will be the third largest state in
the United States although I did that

421
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:12,279
attraction but if it works

422
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:15,299
right you have to cut alaska it happened
to be the third otherwise the second

423
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:15,759
largest

424
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:19,999
middle of nowhere but they have a
downtown and

425
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:23,489
I'm not the only one who had a similar
experience with this engage in this type

426
00:24:23,489 --> 00:24:26,679
management but sensually the goal here
is

427
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:30,579
get in the building prove access to a
sensitive area

428
00:24:30,579 --> 00:24:34,959
in this case it was the Internal Audit
Office and don't be detected

429
00:24:34,959 --> 00:24:38,899
flight alright so go in the lobby this
bank

430
00:24:38,899 --> 00:24:42,159
you look around downtown tower recall
gonna bro

431
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,459
you drive around a few times you've done
you require a erased on their economy

432
00:24:46,459 --> 00:24:47,639
know what's going on

433
00:24:47,639 --> 00:24:51,649
run talk about how to high that in later
into a formal process because

434
00:24:51,649 --> 00:24:55,119
again some companies really like all
processes and charts though what we're

435
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,279
dealing with though is

436
00:24:56,279 --> 00:25:00,299
I know that mag locked baddest

437
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:04,679
but not very well protected mornings

438
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:09,450
again campaign here first thing in the
morning I hate mornings

439
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:12,519
like for me to read team is the first
thing in the morning I've got a lake

440
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:16,809
prep for a week and just like get outta
bed before eight o'clock

441
00:25:16,809 --> 00:25:20,249
which you seem so my wife and all the
children awesome

442
00:25:20,249 --> 00:25:25,820
sky me first actually I should like
they're gonna like they told me that

443
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,799
they hear the contrary

444
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,829
you anyway so

445
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:33,089
other thing I learned earned rekon was
their

446
00:25:33,089 --> 00:25:37,109
their little construction phase the back
motion sensor door

447
00:25:37,109 --> 00:25:41,339
never gets locked so that was cool our
show up at seven oh eight in the morning

448
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:44,389
Park in the visitor parking

449
00:25:44,389 --> 00:25:48,739
that I pretty my own batch for showing
it to I am

450
00:25:48,739 --> 00:25:52,599
walkin again coming down the hallway I

451
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:56,459
one other things the sky I want me to do
though is like show is many of the

452
00:25:56,459 --> 00:25:58,809
potential water bilities as possible so
like

453
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:02,469
I knew they had infrared cameras well
I've got a nice handy little flashlight

454
00:26:02,469 --> 00:26:06,899
that as I R stroked I or just an IR

455
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:11,829
beam I highly recommend something like
this if you ever doing anything

456
00:26:11,829 --> 00:26:15,379
and testing related or red team related
just a little bit a guy

457
00:26:15,379 --> 00:26:18,480
this has white red white and blue cuz

458
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,620
freedom USA but also has I R

459
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,639
it'll do in three different entities and
strobe

460
00:26:25,639 --> 00:26:28,889
for each color strap that on my on my
are

461
00:26:28,889 --> 00:26:32,200
una Manzana struck out on my

462
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,679
amaya Bell cross my European back

463
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,129
my satchel and I'm just walk in and I've
gotta

464
00:26:39,129 --> 00:26:42,769
in looking at the the video later is
really funny there literally was a white

465
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:44,200
blob coming down the hallway

466
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,289
so so if you have somebody reviewing
tapes they're gonna know something's

467
00:26:48,289 --> 00:26:49,029
wrong

468
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:52,110
but if you get out fast enough they will
know it was you

469
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,429
that's the whole idea there but again
it's really fun to do he going to

470
00:26:55,429 --> 00:26:57,950
Walmart with one others on the year real
upset

471
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:01,750
real fast a shoot right

472
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:05,460
well the other thing and it was they had

473
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,610
motion sensors for egress right you for
these stories right

474
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:12,639
so when you come in yet the bad when you
go out i mean

475
00:27:12,639 --> 00:27:16,129
employees can't be bothered to get the
patch back out again swipe it so

476
00:27:16,129 --> 00:27:19,759
most places will put in a button a lot
of places or put a

477
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:23,220
motion sensor right next to the door
because you know why not

478
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:27,279
well as was mentioned last night ADA did
some interesting things right

479
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,039
one other things was that require the
doors to be up off the floor so there's

480
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:31,149
less resistance for

481
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:35,090
handicapped individuals I while that
leaves a lot of room to put something

482
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:35,970
under a door

483
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:39,620
on this particular case it was near
Ballantyne saw at the Walmart

484
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,740
about this PSB balloon and said

485
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:45,980
be my valentine others Pines

486
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:50,000
AK I just aloe I'd like to see the ones
got rejected

487
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,460
right they had a meeting about it and be
my valentine what they pay

488
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,700
there were others

489
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,419
I want to know what the others were so
this about this be though it's been

490
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:01,210
deflated

491
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:05,539
also got some refrigerator touring from
the home repair section at Walmart

492
00:28:05,539 --> 00:28:08,980
and some duct a looted art

493
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:12,590
side and then taped it up real good
that's in my bag while I have to set the

494
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,570
doors to go through

495
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:17,269
well you know what happens with a
negress answer right its motion based

496
00:28:17,269 --> 00:28:20,380
shove a balloon through it blow it up

497
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:25,789
motion sensor triggers door opens this
also works very well

498
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:29,750
with I can there so

499
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:34,580
basically the idea the so these motion
sensors are basically taking iron dealt

500
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:34,919
us

501
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:38,000
right there and they're checking for
death when there's a difference they

502
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,620
trigger

503
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:42,299
well when that trigger means open the
door great for us

504
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:46,080
bad for that I now I've seen a pretty
decent

505
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,070
fix for that they are actually you
change your motions together

506
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:53,149
so that if someone is coming down a
hallway you put a motion sensor further

507
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:54,019
down the hallway

508
00:28:54,019 --> 00:28:57,440
so that they have to be triggered in
order in order for the doors to open

509
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,360
it's a very creative solution i've seen
I've seen people try to put their motion

510
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,059
sensors on a time schedule and that

511
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:06,870
just product completely failed for them
and in other places have managed to do

512
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:07,269
that

513
00:29:07,269 --> 00:29:12,179
I but essentially again in audit no
problem for soda blast doors open

514
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:15,389
to an audit same deal under the door
swirl around

515
00:29:15,389 --> 00:29:18,850
its and it was cracking yeah it's
actually Mike Mike Google profile

516
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:19,750
picture right now

517
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:23,500
cuz ur it with a full glass door and as
I'm blowing up this be

518
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,710
it's laying there greeted at a

519
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:30,770
conflict got this big shit eating grin
for under the door

520
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:35,160
there's a glass looking back at it it
was a spiritual experience the holiday

521
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:40,400
there's no cameras up their second floor
you're good no one in the back and win

522
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,720
in the employee entrance and

523
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,070
yeah a problem and nobody was there some
o'clock in the morning man

524
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:49,790
shop to work at seven good for you Idaho

525
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:53,170
I know one person I work with that I
would never do that to you get there

526
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:57,010
5 believe that three bodies there are 50
so

527
00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:02,470
guy so I'm enright I'm in audit again

528
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:05,960
I don't have to do anything there but
based on the testing are nearly done in

529
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,210
a

530
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:11,050
facility again I could have plugged in a
sleeper Gandhi ACP done things

531
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:14,890
again real attack stuff right these
people pay

532
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:18,520
huge box for outsourced security
monitoring

533
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,640
and they want to put

534
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,860
I you know it's needed installing on
their servers for some reason

535
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:29,370
but it's like just all the stuff right
they think they got there

536
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:33,670
network stuff taken care of and yet

537
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:36,700
somebody can still just walk into a
building an attacker can still this walk

538
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,520
into a building

539
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:42,230
all its talk about how to do that get
bread teamTalk

540
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:45,770
hacker con we're gonna talk about
controlling yourself and this is where

541
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:46,450
this highs

542
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:49,800
someone into the previous social
engineering aspect when senator

543
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:54,030
dealing with other people there's a lot
I think the gets missed in dealing with

544
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,580
yourself while dealing with other people

545
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,820
and a lot of times well

546
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:02,700
we'll get to that so we think it's a sin
bore this important to me

547
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,960
comes up primo as a situational
awareness guy a very certain that

548
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,470
that the greasy spoon restaurant with
the what's your face a stellar like all

549
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:15,130
these weird things he understands from
his environment and she's like

550
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:18,690
well yeah whatever it's no big deal to
me like list of these things about

551
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:22,760
where to find a gun how far he can run
at full pace bowlers can start to shake

552
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,810
whether or not the dude sitting at the
counter can actually fight

553
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:30,660
or not they can easily why do I know
this is freaking me out and I got a bank

554
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,560
account my leg out I guess

555
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:36,270
was going on but the concept these

556
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:40,540
distributing there is called situation
awareness he understands what's going on

557
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,430
around him

558
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:44,560
to obscene detail and

559
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:50,269
we're probably never gonna have that
capacity a because that's fiction

560
00:31:50,269 --> 00:31:53,320
and be because the Sun really necessary

561
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,009
but the concept is strong I think I

562
00:31:57,009 --> 00:32:01,249
the problem is we're more ma the motha
the time

563
00:32:01,249 --> 00:32:04,539
then we are Neil I'm real sorry

564
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:07,559
I event is Neil I

565
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:11,639
that's about all we got going for us so

566
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:16,289
how do we do this well now with he

567
00:32:16,289 --> 00:32:20,389
an hour a day you getting kids some
other some acronyms at you

568
00:32:20,389 --> 00:32:23,399
and this will be this'll be where we
spend the rest of our time and and if

569
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:25,239
you have any questions or would like
some Baileys

570
00:32:25,239 --> 00:32:29,679
feel free to interject so gonna deal
with awareness

571
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:34,269
options an execution these like three
components you can stage this out

572
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:37,919
these are not like the word of God
because I pull them out a mass a week

573
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:38,940
ago I wrote this

574
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:42,749
so we're dealing with situational and
self-awareness

575
00:32:42,749 --> 00:32:46,700
we're dealing with options concept
there's gonna be more is better

576
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:51,009
AAA hey what can I do finish it

577
00:32:51,009 --> 00:32:54,049
he there

578
00:32:54,049 --> 00:33:01,049
now the

579
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:04,340
and then how do we actually end up doing
this

580
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:07,550
what we talk about in these two is

581
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:11,930
generally not as often talked about it
this is and I think this is good

582
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:16,290
I just wanna gotta spread it out
something realize I know that I need to

583
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,740
go somewhere and chill out

584
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:21,190
when I talk to security when I'm in a
building right I know that about myself

585
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:21,800
now

586
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,110
I learned that with the we can figure
out some methods for everyone to do that

587
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:29,460
step one to me and I stole this from our
man let us know I polish guys for

588
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,710
supporting the patriarchy

589
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:34,110
sorry I'm sis gendered and it's just my
privilege

590
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:37,540
7 they could I get all ordered them

591
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:42,600
good alright this is where you wanna
stay

592
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,270
there some psychology there there's also
some good physiology stuff there as far

593
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,450
as adrenaline levels

594
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:51,770
and your dopamine levels you various
chemicals ago your body the things that

595
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:54,580
you actually enjoy turn to all you
really enjoying life as dopamine

596
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,380
serotonin

597
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:59,070
the whole your room a regular that's
where it's at

598
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:04,110
but you know people leave train people
to do this people who study the sort of

599
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:07,500
thing say that this is really where it's
at you don't wanna be like super chill

600
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,179
mode

601
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:12,370
I'll you don't be 10 guy either for sure
but condition yellows about where you

602
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:13,080
want to be

603
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:17,140
you can skirt around in condition arms
for a little while

604
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:20,310
and again I'm giving you all and cool
stuff so you can be like that totally

605
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,200
wrong here

606
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,140
so this is really dangerous this is
getting caught

607
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:28,530
here you're just like in the corner in a
fetal position crack

608
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:31,560
so ideally

609
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:36,330
you need to know how to keep yourself
here and that allows you to not only

610
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:37,860
continue to observe

611
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:41,240
and be aware but then execute what you
need to do next

612
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:44,560
because again it's two parts you're
dealing with yourself internally

613
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,270
you're dealing with other people
externally in it really schizophrenic to

614
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:48,760
train

615
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,720
think about that while you're doing it
as opposed to learn how to naturally

616
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,690
do it so the next concept is that you to
lose

617
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:59,850
love the Luton boy it's brilliant

618
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:03,530
an israeli a lot better flow charts and
such and there's a pentagram

619
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:04,440
tap

620
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,609
free hail Baphomet

621
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:12,720
but essentially this is your constant
loop

622
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:17,640
here your observing and again we dealt
with them serving others as well as

623
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,500
earning yourself

624
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:22,880
your orienting yourself deciding what
sort of variables there are and again

625
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,640
these are not hard bass a read on to you
too so we can

626
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,060
getting in the slide cultural traditions
genetic heritage

627
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,740
new information previous experience and
analysis and synthesis

628
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:36,109
is all very dynamic process that's a
good word for

629
00:35:36,109 --> 00:35:39,140
your documents if management wants a
process document will he's a very

630
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,560
dynamic processes you know

631
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,240
so and then you can throw this in their
in their light wall this guy

632
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,770
do him a bonus haven't had that happen
yet so

633
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:52,560
your mileage may vary I but this is a
century where we're going right to you

634
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,320
00 the side and again this isn't like
sit down and wait either

635
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,190
weigh the options now playing jump to
conclusions or anything here in the

636
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:00,980
office space

637
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:04,840
and then you do it you do it and really

638
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:09,090
you gotta go with it when it happens
something I mentioned earlier

639
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:13,090
was when I said I global options where
these things

640
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:17,240
and their start options

641
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:21,820
more is better by options I mean thing
similar to a strategy game

642
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:24,950
when you can put yourself in a position

643
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:28,940
to have 10 potential different outcomes
to act on

644
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:33,030
way more advantageous for you then if
you put yourself in a situation where

645
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:35,520
you have want to outcome success or fail

646
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,660
you want your variables so that you can
give yourself something think on your

647
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,210
toes

648
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:43,820
so for example my interaction with the
security guard

649
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:48,100
I didn't know what was going to happen
i'd thought through these processes

650
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,339
but I didn't wanna make the decision for
her

651
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:57,119
I wanted her to have data order to
happen of control data that I gave her

652
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,200
to come to a conclusion that was
beneficial for me

653
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,350
fortunately it worked on the first try

654
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:06,400
and I got to play the dumb new guy

655
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,920
I don't know why I don't happen with the
picture on having gotten one yet

656
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,970
I'm here for meaning I'm late I don't

657
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:17,200
I'll you're supposed to know that like
right and put the pressure on very

658
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,599
subtly but you're still the

659
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:23,500
the passive one week into some more
terms are met had she s really bad

660
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,859
what I've done well I actually don't
know get an active

661
00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:30,970
but the point is hopefully

662
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:34,560
I would have had enough awareness about
myself and what was going on

663
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:39,070
to put my next step in the place that
word again allow me a broad spectrum to

664
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,410
deal with because the ideas

665
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:44,320
you trying to get out of that situation
widening it out

666
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,640
putting a wall making at least making
them think they have control

667
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,820
I'm beyond gone in the building
regardless like she had very bad

668
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:54,030
I probably like would've been like let
me call my manager and i wanna call my

669
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,150
actual manager

670
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:58,270
back at his house been testing firm I'm
like dude

671
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:02,130
I don't know why she's not let me in can
you talk to her I guarantee you he

672
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:04,310
woulda got here

673
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:08,870
I so its again options you have these
options

674
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,930
these are things that are available to
you and you need to maintain those

675
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:12,830
options

676
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:17,300
for you again were being attackers
you're supposed to be

677
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:20,890
really unethical turns out attackers are
really unethical

678
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:26,200
alright there's are theirs are like
moral giveaway on a what is that

679
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,480
by the by swimming

680
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:33,210
to work with sorry so

681
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:36,370
partner the observation orientation
things

682
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:40,310
RR again reading other people and this
is a a brief interaction that but

683
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:43,480
you gotta figure out what role you're
playing world they're playing

684
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,830
again self-awareness adds to that if you
know where you're better

685
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:50,560
comfortable with you know what you're
capable of and you can always blood on

686
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,550
your way into a building sometimes you
have to be the DOM sometimes you have to

687
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,290
be the SUP

688
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:58,450
like this is a really key analogy for
this when you coming up the someone

689
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:02,310
regardless love whether or not you're
thinking this

690
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:05,280
there's an implicit social hierarchy
that takes place and I think what a

691
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:05,900
great things about

692
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:09,610
afrikans we try to get read that right
everybody has something to say everybody

693
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:10,650
has ideas

694
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:14,170
we can benefit from that they're all
valuable all the real world fortunately

695
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:16,060
is not structured itself that way

696
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:19,930
in there are social hierarchies and you
have to learn how to read them in at

697
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:22,630
least make assumptions about them your
sanctions might be

698
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:25,860
wrong but people make wrong assumptions
all the time

699
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,940
people are used to people being wrong
people used to people not thinking like

700
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:29,340
them

701
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:32,460
so if you just have a whole set a
framework questions where are these are

702
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,790
my assumptions about what was supposed
to happen here

703
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:37,680
someone disagrees with that will they
have to take it on themselves pretty

704
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,620
wrong especially if their security role

705
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:44,050
rambling but that's the deal the other
things are gonna be looking for comfort

706
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:44,550
levels

707
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:48,200
and interest levels so that security
guard

708
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,710
I don't know why I got like three ever

709
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:54,760
I have no idea why should been stopped
right at that desk

710
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,820
something about how that went though

711
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:02,020
cleared me in her mind don't know what
it was

712
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:05,680
somebody could probably tell you some I
can analyze and come up with the gas but

713
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,680
again we're we're dealing

714
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:13,680
with a guess yessir

715
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:19,740
well it's not a police officer

716
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:23,980
if I get detained I have a letter in my
pocket from

717
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:27,450
the first her boss but says right well

718
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:34,339
with first-time getting going about
their with this one thing I mean you do

719
00:40:34,339 --> 00:40:36,820
have that but that's a thing right we're
going to deal with that there's other

720
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:40,920
but yes so fair enough right give away I
am supposed to be doing this

721
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,950
I'm I can say a mentally I have no

722
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:48,400
problem justifying this not because I'm
a psychopath

723
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,119
or so see about the law may be but
because I actually do have it was a

724
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:53,770
permission to do that what if I'm not

725
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:57,280
well weakened again after you had a deal
with those emotions inside

726
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,800
there so confusing at times

727
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,960
and those two steps are practice and
Pratt

728
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,340
so you don't wanna go on site

729
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:10,520
and like suddenly I'd try to Jason
Bourne your way out in situation

730
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,220
awareness like you can't miss you had a

731
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:15,320
an owl look around obviously extend the
room

732
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:20,140
spin in circles to observe now I do it
right gotta practice this

733
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:23,330
and again your come off really weird to
people

734
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:26,490
doing this I the deal is

735
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:30,100
it again trying to explain walking on
all with your friend like

736
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:33,490
you know we we step and then we are we
have

737
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:36,570
more conversation I'll do it

738
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:40,460
use walk down the hall with a friend you
are not a detailed answer from Australia

739
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:44,530
what they do barely holding on to law
place that is from austin is also said

740
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:46,350
the bats on upside down down there

741
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:50,620
tonight i learn all kinds according to
this weekend

742
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:53,780
but the toilet does go the same way

743
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:58,440
to Sarda that's cool yep you practice
this though

744
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,700
right i mean do it in you know a
comfortable place but like you don't

745
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,130
wanna make

746
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:06,210
assumptions in a judgmental level about
people that you can read things right we

747
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:09,040
can read the context that the room you
can see my Kirk use

748
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,720
you know you can learn to know what
people look like when they're

749
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,920
disinterested or their

750
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,680
ready for you to change the slide
hurling here tired of hearing you ramble

751
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,610
on about practice when they're gonna be
weird in the above ally

752
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:22,980
so back director Mike Bailey miss you

753
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:27,410
the other is prep work and this is where
we get down the nuts and bolts are art

754
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:29,990
will how I'm like I'm sitting here
talking about self-awareness

755
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:35,930
alright cool what do you do with that
well you could be like this dude

756
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:38,470
that bears is good to go

757
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:41,510
right these ready to go

758
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:44,839
get worked up going to a building

759
00:42:44,839 --> 00:42:48,150
didn't like get hyped up got a strap
elbows up

760
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:52,039
right neither nyse: look like that right
sometimes you really have to like

761
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:56,349
turn down a little bit yet to figure out
what's going to work for you

762
00:42:56,349 --> 00:43:00,700
and I think there's some pretty decent
bonuses this you have to have some sleep

763
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:01,450
Friday

764
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:04,700
we honor their best I can do we like to
think where hackers and that we

765
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:08,720
do best in milan I we set alarm sticker
caffeine pills at 11:30

766
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,109
I perfect the first

767
00:43:13,109 --> 00:43:18,359
we we you know we we like to think we
can do things we were really in the

768
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:20,609
brain and then we go back to that Python
Roy

769
00:43:20,609 --> 00:43:26,670
no wonder therefore he/she I wasn't even
thinking back to that service

770
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:30,660
a farmer was never going to work but
like

771
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:34,690
you gotta have some sleep right this is
step one rest is important

772
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:37,980
you know politics sleep structures being
what they are

773
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:41,130
that works for you call whatever I need
eight hours

774
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:45,390
I'm gonna be topped them all in a
building I need eight hours a filler

775
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:49,599
Yes No rebel might not be the answer Red
Bull makes you jittery

776
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:53,880
a lot but also makes really weird with
sela

777
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,140
to Bacchus War II that's going on here

778
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:04,040
if you wanna do crime don't do a liar
drawn

779
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:04,990
guess again

780
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:09,600
the block Jana forever and so is murder
hey gonna do crime

781
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,740
this press yes I do you know your target

782
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:18,610
as much as you can now so here's where
this breaks down I I had no idea

783
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:22,630
what was going to happen at me too those
doors I think a

784
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:27,630
I knew kinda what's happened before I've
done it a couple times he had

785
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:31,520
but there's no guy to

786
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,520
if this happened do this

787
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:38,510
if this happens do this that's it's not
a hard-and-fast

788
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:43,430
logic circuit and its problematic
because we want to have the systems we

789
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:45,300
want to have these frameworks built out

790
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:49,530
and a lot of times its intuitive
knowledge is the the thing about

791
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:54,640
route who tong its funny we just can't
really why to go to Wikipedia page for

792
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,570
even the a cycle about it Encyclopedia
Dramatica page doesn't really explain it

793
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,070
but it's all areas too

794
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:03,180
and like it's just this concept that we
did

795
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:07,470
things culturally we get things as you
know where we are in this point in time

796
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:10,320
in history is just so much dynamic

797
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:14,420
aspect that that you know it's really
tough to do so the ideal for dole is

798
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,910
VA wreck your client or the place you're
robbing

799
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:23,310
honor do illegal things by so

800
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:27,290
I'm telling stories right as me in every
contest needs to be a of course Coverity

801
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:28,340
management now

802
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:31,550
II let's say yes

803
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:34,599
actually don't think it does I think
these are highly specialized things I

804
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:37,130
think that are are you know full
adversarial modeling

805
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:40,300
should not be done if you don't have a
pass for policy

806
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:44,980
I hope that obvious but I've had clients
that want like the

807
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:49,550
all Lee RED team and you go and start
like

808
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:53,290
checking their public-facing Iwan single
factor VPN

809
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:57,710
turns out the guy founded the company
has a blank password

810
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:01,480
call I don't want to break into your
building you're not ready

811
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:05,490
for that you're going to get broken into
especially if you so weapons

812
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:08,750
I by

813
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:12,869
I it's bad do you have to have a turtle
all going to be knife

814
00:46:12,869 --> 00:46:17,010
I can a man Anthony to be right so
what's my point

815
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:22,670
my point is we have to attack like
attackers

816
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:25,910
because our bag I S kangaroos

817
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:30,299
who by the way of so kangaroos if they
get chased by

818
00:46:30,299 --> 00:46:34,540
dawn they warn Rhino get the dog to
commit real hard this is a good

819
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:38,290
now you for reading sup they'll get the
dog chase on and what they'll do is off

820
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:41,520
I like the small pond with this light
water and three feet or so and I'll sit

821
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,549
in there and wait for the dog to come in
after on the ground

822
00:46:44,549 --> 00:46:48,010
brown in public third videos

823
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:52,119
this in features hormone hurdle the ball

824
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:56,430
of play so

825
00:46:56,430 --> 00:47:00,130
that take I'll be easy clay

826
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:04,730
she lived to tell that story Lake

827
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:07,799
yet but that can your room and

828
00:47:07,799 --> 00:47:11,920
otherwise he still using using the
kangaroo growth rate is lay out their

829
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,359
old Jack and Jill

830
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:18,490
they have some self awareness for this
in tiananmen

831
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:22,200
I hope their lessons and then we are
forever

832
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:28,200
a cuz man but the idea is we have to
attack like attackers

833
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:32,290
and if we don't do that 10 testings
gonna

834
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:35,300
you know it's going to sound fun it is
fine

835
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:40,330
its real fine problem is in order to
keep getting paid doing it

836
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:44,040
we act actually benefit the company
somehow get back to that chart

837
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:47,370
purses like actual gem stones precious
things I am

838
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:52,010
the funny quotes around this that I ice
toll from Chris nickerson install from

839
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:55,680
mike tyson's like the idea like we have
all our plans right we have our

840
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,750
PCP ever security plans we have this
that and the other

841
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:02,320
according to the great philosopher mike
tyson everybody has a plan until they

842
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,530
get punched in the face

843
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:06,530
and red teaming

844
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:10,460
is punching yourself in the face they

845
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:14,190
sometimes within the hospital for that
and sometimes give you a raise

846
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:17,320
it just happens but this is the idea

847
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:22,180
so to summer of break into things

848
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:26,220
do it the way attackers are going to do
it have fun at Carolina con

849
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:30,560
right so this is tough to explain stuff
to do it started a higher for a week and

850
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:30,910
like

851
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:36,220
come up with the HR proved interview
rate so if I if I wanna interview

852
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:37,960
somebody and be like so tell me

853
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:42,770
how you would do XYZ or just what
there's not gonna be hard fast answer

854
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:43,260
for that

855
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:48,630
say like what does dash in doing in that
can you can come up with documentation

856
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:52,900
like okay well I can't check on answered
a question like its it's really tough to

857
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,390
interview for this and that's okay

858
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:57,700
right we're doing advanced level attacks
were trying to formalize its gonna be a

859
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:58,660
little bit difficult that

860
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:01,700
by do a pic things anyway and

861
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:05,060
after the haters follow the law whatever
thanks a lot

862
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:05,440
so
