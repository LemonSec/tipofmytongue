1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:03,520
thank you so

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,950
at did present us ministers regarding
get picked up a did

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,099
get it to work on a blog post smaller
venue this

4
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:14,200
and this is a

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,580
tartars came out I'll a insert response
I was involved and Charlie

6
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,600
fiery ty and I saw an issue where

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,689
they're spending a lot of time trying to
get answers questions the

8
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:29,970
if it's been a little bit I'm you know

9
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,700
out for prevention or the Countach your
little time before hand could have

10
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,239
helped us out a long way

11
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,020
overdoing so

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,420
I'm sure some other things to talk about
lot of people here

13
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,879
pride on your head probably experienced
ourselves

14
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,410
but figures something share

15
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,670
you said twenty years in the Navy

16
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,609
12 years working on planes as an
intermediate level maintenance

17
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:00,780
technician preppy teen radar there

18
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,260
I'm actually working on a test fixture
for radar circuit card assemblies

19
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:10,180
this particular fixed year we had gotten
from the vendor

20
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,670
and I'm working on a wire rack circuit
card connector with about 200

21
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,439
connections that were miss wire

22
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,080
and all wire at having to

23
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:27,080
unwrap it re rapid the right place took
me about two days to fix that a

24
00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:34,140
afternoon maybe asian man inside as a
statement there too at Naval Air Station

25
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,109
Oceana

26
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:39,420
the sales start working on radars to my
cheap /a

27
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,310
about I get work done ATP shop she was
like okay so they know it's been three

28
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,549
years as the Information Assurance
Manager for fleet Readiness Inter Milan

29
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,950
during that time had some interesting
things

30
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:56,789
you know if anyone's done the
Information Assurance Manager job before

31
00:01:56,789 --> 00:02:01,719
they can be trying at times especially
when users come running in your office

32
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:07,009
i cant got shut down what were you doing
I don't know and of course i'm looking

33
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:10,019
Active Directory where the knockers put
in the notes

34
00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:13,599
wire captured yes you do to get your
chief

35
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,959
I after that I converted to

36
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:20,959
CTN a Cryptologic technician that works

37
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,650
spent I got offered three different
krier optimism that

38
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,040
I was go up to an essay really awesome

39
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,760
you know network exploitation attack the
other was go to

40
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,799
maybe cyber its operations and sit on
the watch for and

41
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:40,849
answer service calls a day from people
whose networks routing issues

42
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:45,750
and the third was go to Navy information
operations and do network defense

43
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,380
as shows how it fits cuz you know
glutton for punishment

44
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:54,540
anyone will tell you defense is a lot
harder than anything else so

45
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,230
it's been five years they're doing
network assessments

46
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,590
helping ship spend their networks

47
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:08,010
doing the operational test and
evaluation so

48
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,310
I live jokes she loves all my see

49
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,690
stories they'll start with this one time
and I was drunk

50
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:19,580
a I've started to turn them into my

51
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,880
cautionary tales on MySpace you spend

52
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:27,660
spenders golden years 18 to 21

53
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,970
overseas when when drinking age is an
issue um

54
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,580
but you know I like stern does now into

55
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:43,580
two stories tell people just like this
store equipment

56
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,570
sir so you know

57
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:51,610
I find that all other networks we have
problems keeping track at the

58
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:56,840
I am you know finding things and
filesystem things like that

59
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,260
and the next slide on that show you is
the top secret work

60
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,410
and to what a government work file
system looks like

61
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:09,820
or

62
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,130
maybe that's what most so far network
file system look like

63
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:17,660
it's okay to admit it you know it enter

64
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,180
to lose things in hard drive space is
chief right

65
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,230
you know you can buy a terabyte hard
drive for couple hundred bucks

66
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,450
you know download more stuff fill it up

67
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,990
on the tends to be a problem though

68
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,380
when you start working in certain spots
because

69
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,400
now you got it find stuff and all others

70
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,790
downloaded files for you downloaded you
know

71
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:44,290
every version I've been mapped going
back to first one

72
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,900
now this is actually kinda funny because

73
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,950
yeah we're only a person 65 in that but
how many

74
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:55,720
actual release is at their back when I
counted on on the

75
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,919
the page's pride about 23 release pick
in Mattoon

76
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,140
I'll doing you know and we all tend to
be kinda

77
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:08,630
you know file orders dali and so

78
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:12,260
you know when you're dealing with
managing enterprise network and

79
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:16,650
using a network tools that can be kinda
bad is those tolls

80
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,300
are the same tools that people use when
they come in and check your network

81
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:25,110
in PowerShell yet talkin birthday you
know all these tools that for use in

82
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,710
everyday for management at the same
tools that

83
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:35,710
attackers using to to hold on her
networks

84
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,520
other thing we find problems with is
that people don't base line and it works

85
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,990
so they don't know what's normal
behavior and what's not

86
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:55,980
so you know

87
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:00,040
you start having instanttraffic come out
of a box somewhere or

88
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,380
bunch file suddenly show up disappear

89
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,340
a lot of times people are paying
attention that so

90
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,870
again making sure you have there's never
baseline had a time what's normal track

91
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:17,070
what's normal files also find

92
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,410
taking time at a time to educate
leadership

93
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:24,680
goes a long way now I was a bit of an
oddball

94
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,040
and an 80 being a junior analyst guy had
to advanced degrees

95
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,060
so I use usually I people called hey can
you come down explain this

96
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,300
okay and I found

97
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,940
the if I take time probably before Major
Incident Response Avent

98
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:45,050
or if I had pre-prepared material sit
down and say

99
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,720
you know here's what's going on here's
why this is a concern or not a cancer

100
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,740
pie would have gone a long way save a
lot of time

101
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:58,540
won the questions recurring questions I
got was

102
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:03,790
how to the attackers gains tools and our
complete well they're already there

103
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:07,680
again like a set these are the tools
that were using to manage our network

104
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,470
day-to-day

105
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,250
say bye remember the discovery show

106
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,310
takes a pee I

107
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,650
yeah the the trope was you know this guy
shows up

108
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:22,380
hey we wanna you know break in your
house show you how bad your security is

109
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,670
is you know you be a scary operate wanna
is up so it's the guy

110
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:30,550
did the break-ins no walks into the back
yard there's an extent square there it's

111
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,500
locked to %uh a fence post

112
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,390
but it's just a post like I just picks
latter up

113
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,460
of person carries it over the house

114
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:45,030
right in through the second for when you
know

115
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:48,290
so explaining that these tools are there

116
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:51,760
but and that we need the stalls there

117
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,950
but how can we like the tools like put
ladder in the garage

118
00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:01,660
or actually like the latter's something
that's not going and then

119
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,710
we get into the well he's our attack
tools on May 10

120
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:09,250
PS exact isn't necessarily attacked or
can be used that way to

121
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:13,110
to let you pick your tax mismanagement
or

122
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:17,850
you know so it is a tool is wet

123
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:21,830
yeah the right answer is

124
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:25,840
it depends on who's using it for what
purpose you know if your network

125
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,460
managers using it to push patches to a
box it

126
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,660
you know your patch solution can connect
who were

127
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,580
in Iran update somewhere you know

128
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,690
verses when attackers using it to it

129
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:42,110
so you know

130
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:46,580
being the No the handled the way I look
at things

131
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,440
solving problems you know a carriage
back into my aviation background

132
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,490
and you know some things you try and
figure out

133
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:57,050
what we do the kinda fix this how can we
save

134
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:00,440
the hundreds a man hours were spending

135
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,520
tracking down you're going hey we found
this

136
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,770
can you talk to the network engineers
and find out

137
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:13,770
this year's as you put this here waiting
for day two days network injures one

138
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,530
you know so

139
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:23,530
you know so I ask you know

140
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:27,610
you know what tools you use in on your
network

141
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:32,260
if you don't know go out and find out

142
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,980
so

143
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:39,210
you know again reaching back in my
background

144
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:43,910
aviation maintenance a we have things in
aviation St

145
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:47,190
cue track rentals I see their the

146
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:51,360
tool boxes so let that is so the if I
open a tool box drawer

147
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,360
I can honestly tell things out a place

148
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:00,370
if anything is missing if the wrong
tools are in you go to any

149
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,400
squadron anywhere in the Navy open up
tool box

150
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,020
at a bus will be the same across in a
because

151
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,850
the need to know the standardized you
walk into any shop

152
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:15,090
toolboxes say it's easy fast and Tori

153
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:18,740
lets you know it's there what's not and

154
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,890
been in see is unclassified

155
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:25,280
or you can actually go to NAVAIR website

156
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,730
re if you want to read the hundreds of
pages at the this is what we call the

157
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:29,120
net

158
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,870
naval aviation means for this is what
talks about

159
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:36,080
is how we identify where the tools

160
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,490
law yet towards and we

161
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:43,630
give a description toolbox local to Liz

162
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:47,110
and

163
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:51,210
the that picture but this is a hairline
inspires

164
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,260
my for shit you can see possessed

165
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:58,710
organization code WorkCentre esposito
like summer

166
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:02,650
and so

167
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:05,580
by doing this by by kinda action the
tall

168
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,860
you know where that all came from I'll
share a an anecdote this isn't really my

169
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,530
story

170
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,910
guy work he's to be in a a

171
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:20,910
power slider a six-piece and they were
doing a a phase inspection on the

172
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:22,770
airplane

173
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:26,160
space inspection was to remove the
horizontal stabilizers

174
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,730
trip a small wings on the back to play
they took

175
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:35,900
one in the mall and they found a rich
about a foot long wrench

176
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,170
in the air freight and so they look

177
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:42,630
and they look at that she and that
belong to the aviation depot

178
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:46,740
and the aviation maintenance we have
organization those are the guys

179
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,780
and the squadron to take the boxes at a
point they bring into a guy like me

180
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:54,900
I'm in there enemy I can't fix it as
into the deeper

181
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,880
or Depot also does refits airframes
everyone's

182
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,470
they figure out the search came from the
depot so they take it took you a

183
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:05,790
Q a's like oh my god scholar Depot

184
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:10,150
everywhere they go oh my god depose les
looking for that ranch

185
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:13,330
without it was lost lost souls are big
deal to me

186
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:17,320
um if you lose it all in the middle a
shift

187
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,030
every piece year that she said now that
shift has come back

188
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:24,900
until you find that all yet take part
everything that's fixed

189
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,900
because you don't wanna flying to an
aircraft

190
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,190
when it's gone much to some so

191
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:34,500
they they call it even if you're not a
fan shop

192
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,560
face inspection to go to put the
stabilizer back on and that

193
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,370
more fit and anything they do they can't
get it to go back on so

194
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,970
my buddy Scott goes back in the Chi Wei
like any this for

195
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:49,460
takes a wrench you know that they put in
the exact place where they found it

196
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:54,760
stabilizer slid right on

197
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,530
that rich had somehow warps the airframe
to the point where

198
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:02,140
if it wasn't there her as the plane was
gone back together

199
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:06,160
so

200
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,000
so you know I thought about a solution
for this

201
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,890
as a result you know is there a way that
a marker watermark tools to use

202
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:20,170
same here in San responders to so that
when you come in and they find stuff in

203
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:20,820
the network

204
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,120
you know like when you do it a friend's
ex use I can SRL

205
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,930
say okay these are on a good fight I
have to worry about spirit

206
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:32,000
you know so what if you were to do

207
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,440
summer-like take your tools figure out
using

208
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,090
is toll-like kashti take Hashem all

209
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:44,140
but that was hasher's in Iran book
somewhere here is a response from book

210
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:49,650
you have right but and so here's a
response come along and say all right

211
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:53,810
is a I'll by the way here's a list of
all the tools that we use

212
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:58,230
hear their hash is here their versions
anything outside to this list you should

213
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,600
consider an IRC

214
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,580
indicator call from a so

215
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:07,780
you have a demo because here's the other
problem

216
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,650
you know you download Sysinternals okay

217
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:15,000
attacker fears I use and Sysinternals he
just goes and gets the same version

218
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,390
right

219
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:19,330
so I came up with an idea

220
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:23,060
that found if

221
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:30,060
make this work

222
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:32,610
you know

223
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:35,920
during a trying to figure out a Crippen
challenge

224
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,460
came across as tall I'd

225
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,510
it's a steganography tall

226
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:47,190
the applies technology to execute all
files

227
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:50,920
I the last update was about ten years
ago

228
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,660
but one other things that no such thing
was escape early

229
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:59,500
you know is a way to to watermark

230
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,660
or uniquely identify the tools that your
use

231
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,470
so when the years the response of the
and run book

232
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:10,500
say here's our list tools artful has a
unique

233
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:15,910
hash now I didn't actually implement
heiden because startin' look around

234
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:19,930
a few other things here's where the demo

235
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:26,380
something

236
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:31,050
and I attempted to record the demo that
didn't work

237
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:37,700
the see

238
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:43,760
so here we have

239
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,190
PS exact and

240
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:50,600
see take haz

241
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,230
PS exact the

242
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:59,320
the clean version no modifications so

243
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,930
in see we have a lot in all bytes you
know just take your standard hex editor

244
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:07,839
get all these no bites lower yes some at
the end

245
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,649
all by city in let's take this little
bike here

246
00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:15,209
down a lower or a corner

247
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:22,209
me 1

248
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,040
know your you can see that

249
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,170
we have unique cash legacy

250
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:47,020
that by whatever you want to do flip it
no bite somewhere

251
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:51,690
so now we take hash if that turns
responders

252
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:58,690
and yes

253
00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:03,119
it still works so

254
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:07,169
not broken the functionality the stall
but what I have done now

255
00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:11,529
is created a unique cash value there
when I get into responders and their

256
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:14,589
gonna routes many hours going through my
network file system

257
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:17,990
China look for indicators a compromise
and say

258
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:21,059
this is legit version the tallest be on
the network

259
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:24,279
Tiger around and I go further

260
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:27,620
by using so I cap locker to do
application whitelisting

261
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,840
and so the only people that can run
these tools

262
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,379
are my system engineers admins and

263
00:17:34,379 --> 00:17:37,779
ago a little bit further and make sure
that they're not logging in with those

264
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:40,200
privilege credentials what they're doing
run as

265
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,289
so they never actually logging into a
workstation

266
00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:46,730
locally that kinda raises the bar

267
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:50,899
and if you think about it anyone that
does the typing network attack

268
00:17:50,899 --> 00:17:53,929
is going to be doing cost-benefit
analysis

269
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:59,559
if they're not a script kiddie they're
gonna sit there and figure out what

270
00:17:59,559 --> 00:17:59,990
level

271
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:03,340
effort to I need to put into attacking
this networking what benefit them

272
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:07,419
they have to put more effort into it
because you're doing some like this

273
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,049
you've got

274
00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:11,200
unique ashes for your tools their

275
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,470
whitelisted nap locker you know they
can't grab your admins credentials

276
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,929
because they're they're using good

277
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,980
practice like not actual in his
credentials in using

278
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,759
and as then they're likely to move on to
the next

279
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:27,869
you know softer you know think about if
you look at the

280
00:18:27,869 --> 00:18:32,929
talks from b-sides TC last year one of
them was there is a law office

281
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:37,820
got attacked not because the loft target
offices the soft target

282
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,480
client was actual target their network
could be breached

283
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,950
regional office send emails from
Exchange Server

284
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:50,650
a look it's my lawyer on the open this
write-up

285
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:57,650
so

286
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,900
so I think I did pretty good eighteen
minutes

287
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:05,360
30-minute presentation to give the
presentation and the demo

288
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:12,360
so any questions

289
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,220
you were

290
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:25,250
and it's so yes you are going to have to
take a cheese

291
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:30,650
starting me like a minute change a bit I
look at it as

292
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:37,650
an ounce prevention being a pal a cure
okay so this is not for

293
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:41,670
for this is gonna be for things like
tolls not not

294
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:45,330
passions gonna be for things like PS
exec and Matt

295
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:48,980
I'm not talking about your security
tools at your security team uses for pen

296
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,150
testing in BA

297
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:56,870
hopefully there oh of like

298
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:00,070
no now we're talking about or not I'm up
passions

299
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:04,650
were talking about about network
management tools so this this is only be

300
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:05,490
a handle things like

301
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:09,610
like Sysinternals tools are things like
that not things they're gonna be

302
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:13,400
hopefully Sysinternals tools aren't
living on your production to stop

303
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:18,660
at okay so so in that

304
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,470
again

305
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,070
okay I see okay

306
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:28,020
that doesn't like it that does you know
different fireman again this this is

307
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,620
prominence a response or Donna and
inter-clan enterprise-class

308
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,860
size network you know are smaller
network

309
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,970

311
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:45,720
not necessarily but me way

312
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,220

313
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:54,390
engineers were already you know hundreds
of thousands of miles

314
00:20:54,390 --> 00:21:01,390
that that will ever happen

315
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:10,820
