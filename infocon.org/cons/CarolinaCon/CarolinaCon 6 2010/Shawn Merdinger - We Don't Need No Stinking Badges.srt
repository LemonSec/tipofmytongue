okay suspect

30
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,350
uh... we're talking electronica grasses
controllers are calling you guys

31
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,730
and that is going to go high level

32
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,820
courtney's mentors what's going on in
this area

33
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,409
as far as uh...

34
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,850
with major players or untouchable
architecture mostly obstacle

35
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,360
a specific brand of that i've been
working

36
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,310
uh... anybody here from s_g_ security
guard

37
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:54,180
any legal representation for missus
clinton

38
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,320
on and

39
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,520
well at least boldly say

40
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,340
so such stick around for

41
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,640
be interesting

42
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,860
and i looked at the point one make is
sound

43
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,570
precursor to

44
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,549
uh... obscenities packing boxes by

45
00:02:10,549 --> 00:02:11,809
next month

46
00:02:11,809 --> 00:02:17,879
and an iso memories for paper todd and
so it'll be a lot more details

47
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:23,809
masa giving the benders more time but
working closely sir

necropsy sir

49
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:30,049
so i will talk about on

50
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:35,079
switch to research this and it will
release or any tax

51
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:38,439
the take away from this will be that you
can apply this to a lot of invented

52
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:40,149
devices disobey prices

53
00:02:40,149 --> 00:02:43,459
tricky to test

54
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:48,260
it's not likely to do a lot in cebu
moderator memory margaret and it's hard

55
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,279
to get informational

this is what you're seeing right now

172
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:33,530
for university research at the pool sold

173
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,940
and that's what they they are other
these devices are managed by what

174
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,360
secretary char

175
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,860
war about the lives of these people

176
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,510
anywhere year moses ninety

177
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:51,480
does anybody here ever configured
expresses infosystems

178
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,450
sent from security perspective report
lynn

179
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,760
viewpoint as that's even better

180
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,140
because it's not just one of these
things that was

181
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,910
it states that sparked me

182
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:01,880
it's not yours

183
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,900
so these guys physical security separate
from pakistan

184
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,660
promises estrogen society purchased them
together

185
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,090
anderson and stuff

186
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:15,850
so you need to be aware

187
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:21,160
they saw the spices s infected
stand-alone statement faucets

188
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,050
ten-year

189
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:22,860
cycle

190
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,880
before he wrote him out

misinformation security policies

192
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,400
ongoing flight

193
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,439
splinters hanks the set

194
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,550
you know you said date back to you know
lack of passion

195
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,230
this is what is it so

196
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,240
princess was really happy

197
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,230
just assume that

198
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,330
continents western security

199
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:55,840
and a security problem

200
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,780
and when you see is a whole lot of uh...

201
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,569
uh... traveled out of me fax

202
00:10:00,569 --> 00:10:01,689
to make this video

203
00:10:01,689 --> 00:10:02,840
goes to lower

204
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,520

00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,400
figuration

207
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,939
so there's a lot different

208
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,490
pardons baldness and

209
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:14,990
went out there on that

210
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,410
cascading failure

211
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,640
and uh... was sublease to be made nine
hundred people in the building

212
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,299
bugger

213
00:10:23,299 --> 00:10:26,500
louise

214
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,000
murder gossips

215
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,730
yes somebody corruption

216
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,920
so pictures overuse

217
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,960
one point out what was actually looks
like to this blocks this is the brain

218
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,550
what got hurt

219
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,260
is this guy here

220
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,520
network controller

221
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,850
and that's got

222
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,570
webserver merits dot

223
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,840
database scott

224
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,930
smother connective v two

225
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,220
for backups in

226
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,880
administration

227
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,880
end up

228
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,550
that it'll connecting to

229
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:09,840
these allocation model model

230
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,750
which will make it looks like mine

231
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,690
which would be you know even a smaller
bits system that doesn't have all

232
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:22,010
database doesn't have opted to plead to
but has us test specific person

233
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,610
which is just one that

234
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,330
harvinder that pat

235
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,470
it was part reader

236
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,080
fuller into it would note

237
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:37,080
and then can't no

238
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,530
so here's the reason for missus often
excuse yours

239
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:44,920
and so that's awesome there is the
network controller which is something

240
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,410
spot

241
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:50,190
and then you see it goes into right into
the corporate way in

242
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:53,140
and then you'll have one of the
suspicion shows which is done

243
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,630
second-tier there

244
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,460
and that's what action would run out of
it

245
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,020
and so you see

246
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,929
its architecture that we throw out

247
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:05,190
you know it's not about having an
isolated it's about

248
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,129
added more you're separately

249
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:08,040
stuff

250
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,750
missing just slap on your network

251
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:18,750
measure

252
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,690
since the netbox

253
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,010
and uh...

254
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,380
is about seven thousand

255
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,010
systems installed

256
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,280
schools

257
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,750
schools are probably other their biggest

258
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,300
the education

259
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,610
they're really getting these moral high
schools and also

260
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,130
splotches

261
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:41,620
would also like hospitals walkers he'd
case studies and i will say about

262
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,380
possible

263
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:48,220
do you think you said you got to get a
law enforcement it's the so he's on

264
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,610
there that's where it goes back to me

265
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,790
lexisnexis

266
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,940
didn't work

267
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,930
but others but the police stations

268
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:02,480
asin install

269
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,130
standing up

270
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:11,130
images uh... a little while ago and
accept the same box sold them

271
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:16,910
excuse securities propagandist use
signal

272
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,740
purchased the distribution rights

273
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,920
from s_-two security so they can all
reprinted

274
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,620
kanwal

275
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,630
reselling out too

276
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,560
that goes down

277
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,350
and then resellers maybe predict yet

278
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,720
and so this is actually

279
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,010
uh... would sign it wrong

280
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:40,940
and look at their easy access solution
this is the same box

281
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,580
estimates

282
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:47,560
but it's not readily apparent because he
got fault for that that distributions

283
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,030
and out what's up

284
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,900
you know what's interesting about this
thing

285
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,970
blossoms

286
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,200
performer billy perspective and keeping
your software update

287
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,700
there's a lot of different

288
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,450
places that customer needs to go to find
out what's going on

289
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:09,230
you've got the information flow that
needs to happen all the witness to

290
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:14,050
security to let me hear all the way to
the end

291
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,190
users

292
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,970
and uh...

293
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,970
but you really trust on

294
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,340
small

295
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,640
dispirited by putting a small local u

296
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,360
meisters copy physical security

297
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,140
guys don't like the and they're the ones
that

298
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:38,130
figure out the sickness

299
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,280
this happens a lot nineteen years

300
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,760
as boxes need to be branded and all that

301
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,630
concert critical

302
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,160
places on the network like this

303
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,680
you know i i think that this the speed
uh...

304
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:56,680
much more clear

305
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:03,230
again you know reading up on this itself

306
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:07,180
it's always important because background
and it's great to jump on the network in

307
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,880
big box eleven

309
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,320
look at the faults

310
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,420
or pass what's up with always good to

311
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,520
disagreed

312
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:27,520
time you were rolling their is a uh...

314
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,330
from that

315
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,210
all this brief attacker

316
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:36,100

317
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,990
they told me that you saw

318
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:41,370
he told me he's my sequel by accident

319
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:44,030
at least history

320
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,209
to save what decision

321
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:47,080

326
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,760

right a civil war

331

and that's really too much

332
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,889
fireworks

333
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:14,640

374
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,710
yesterday dole said it

375
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,990
the

376
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:54,360

377
00:18:54,360 --> 00:19:01,360
why grassroots la confronts ventana

excuse

385
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:28,929
um...

386
00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:35,929
i know i i just i pulled out of this
issue

387
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,890
of course enters

388
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,409
you know sixty even

389
00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:46,000
or itself

390
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,510
two thousand

391
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,800
yet two thousand

392
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,250
misfortune and i can see a single one
single

393
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,050
bender response

394
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:57,920
danny's that's really interesting 'cause
i sing the finale

395
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,820
this web servers one source

396
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,240
but i don't see a development in

397
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,780
it's packet

398
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,620
you know on the scene

399
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:10,620
you know buying tracks

400
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,960
sees u_s_ here's u_n_ life

401
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,169
there's nothing swarms

402
00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:18,710
moved on

403
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,950
that's for sale

404
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,920
open-source community

405
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,680
that took this off problems can

406
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,790
and uh...

407
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,650
and students taking ownership

408
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:33,350
so when i think after sets the standard
but we certainly will win

409
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,150
and stockings

410
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,780
we don't have sap web

411
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,470
refers to take the stand

412
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:44,510
but they still sell

413
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,040
but it's open source

414
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,720
so they passed the

415
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,880
which cost shifting is

416
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,549
shipping is responsible

417
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:54,330
and this is uh... perfect sense

418
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,850
responder units contacted

419
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:03,679
three different agents in the last three
months you can see

420
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,310
opens wednesday seat pretty much had
seen

421
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:11,860
and response their opinions open source
if you don't have to be able to security

422
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,100
despite the fact that

423
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,490
or at least working

424
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,730
old enough to give you an answer

425
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:19,840
you'll get notified

426
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,330
that's nice

427
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:26,500
politics is not somebody export manipal
abilities

428
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,320
the company right now

429
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,320
are

430
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:36,540
endurance to

431
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:40,460
dan wend

432
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,960
your usury

433
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,270
right

434
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:47,000
i mean it it does not absolve them upon

435
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,600
you know and wall says it doesn't solve
the so

436
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,130
within a week since

437
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,820
you know i mean i'm not aware

438
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,610
but i'd look at some of these and his
wife's disagreements

439
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:56,960
his thinking

440
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,330
to my cat

441
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,090
but my granddaughter

442
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:03,450
and everything

443
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,340
back to the antagonized

444
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,779
absolves oldsmobile

445
00:22:07,779 --> 00:22:14,779
i guess it would first

446
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,900
you basically have

447
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,630
hinckley

448
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:25,160
albeit

449
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,160
here

450
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:34,160
expert

451
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,330

experience

453
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,890
the it

454
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,310
so

455
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:53,320
i restarted today has been created
fifteen starts to hit nicole sake

456

457
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,660
dennis hopper is that the attack

458
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,650
whereby with

459
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:03,110
blockbuster great flapping in the way

460
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,720
date i missed this

461
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,530
this legal stuff comes up time and time
again

462
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:12,600
i think you have any calling it the law
school nice eighty one

463
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,660
five ten years of secured work

464
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:18,220
than normal law school

465
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,780
because he did come out there

466
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,440
can often be of the speech heat

467
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,310
since the c

468
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:33,290
times together

469
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:38,060
for yourself and and

470
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:41,649
this quotation on the bottom

471
00:23:41,649 --> 00:23:43,789
paper mache on nineteen uh...

472
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:44,700
outside the beltway

473
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,680
or update

474
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,730
and you know this is

475
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:50,160
how are going to start again you know

476
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,950
put this information out to be
pollutants speeds up

477
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:54,899
involved

478
00:23:54,899 --> 00:23:56,910
it's its challenge

479
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:59,010
dr dot suite

480
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:01,530
consumption is is that we are right

481
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:08,150
because the senate

482
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,020
so they're sequel

483
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,909
equitably backup lucas because my papa
spots dot

484

database

485
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,169
i look at the version analyst for our
estimate

486
00:24:19,169 --> 00:24:20,600
publicly released guy

487
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,120
four o_ sounds

488
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,900
assaults on whites equal dot propped up
on it

489
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,120
this is what i see in the bottom here

490
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:34,350
but when i was sparked such limited
sight stop holds

491
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,940
but he needed it

492
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,510
intellect and they don't know

493
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:44,180
delusional thinking that this is my cv

494
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:47,530
academy and that's what the networks for
too

495
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:48,640
to ups

496
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,710
but the three point i was useful posts
rest

497
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:55,130
patently dug into that but

498
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:57,100
a plausible

499
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:57,950
socio

500
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,400
databases

501
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,530
the particular provided by the network

503
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,160
recently by example excessive

504
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,480
yes answer

505
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,750
known

506
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,790
is up for reports to

507
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:16,049
so there's third-party products like

508
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:17,180
crystal

509
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,560
back in time into this system

510
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,190
and interviews with

511
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,850

extract information bakery

513
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,500
so resentment toward it was at the
smoking

514
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,420
well i want reports for everyone who
uses that smoking here

515
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,120
and then that is that your arteries

516
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:41,100
just health

517
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:48,100
that's is that previously had his views
but

518
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:54,710
this importance of this lobbying and
access and systems huge

519
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,740
call ask europe and uh...

520
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,940
adhere

521
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,320
there was a young lady who was killed by
a

522
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,290
in the lab technician

523
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,210
jesus to bear

524
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:05,380
we see newt

525
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:09,130
state police thing investigated this guy
wasn't all that

526
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:12,070
in doubt what you're doing and that's
the

527
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,650
okay seemed covering up his

528
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,290
that you can select rock pen

529
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:23,170
official airlines trim retreat first
hand from

530
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:25,280
whole walling stopped

531
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,880
buying

532
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,960
no huge part of ending of the track this

533
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,450
was

534
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:34,600
they were looking at the back taxes

535
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,160
and they got him her to say no

536
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,350
and then she can come out

537
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,570
there

538
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:44,110
and that's how they can points dot to
the importance of

539
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:47,620
logging an access

540
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:51,630
obviously security

541
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:56,230
has to be hard to get statements
medicaid at local police

542
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:58,630
all the f_b_i_ and that's it

543
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,910
and that's all

544
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,470
treat you realize that i mean it's there

545
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:06,560
prancing procedures but

546
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,399
unless they have had this

547
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:10,020
information onto them

548
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,630
meeting the logs

549
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,789
poor access

550
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:14,160
and that this guy is going well

551
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,710
ladies were missing

552
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,840
roomed together she did come out

553
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,470
you might have been in cover-up that
crimes

554
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:23,290
maybe he got away with

555
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:29,780
enough of this stuff may use the system
in place were cat box

556
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:34,470
israel like that

557
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,770
this is a top

558
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:38,120
stereotypes

559
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,560
black companies need to break through
custom applications

560
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,299
this is

561
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:44,440
the communications all

562
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,759
that is used too

563
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:47,649
auto discovery

564
00:27:47,649 --> 00:27:50,600
students of the notes again neck around
the network

565
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,880

566
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,940
and the news back directly into the
dorms

567
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,960
this is a small tasks

568
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,690
there's a service listed on

569
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:01,600
seven three sixty there

570
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,670
and you know

571
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:04,880
excuse quarterback scott

572
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,120
and they just got the pact

573
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,070
sticks back to doing your research

574
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:12,020
right not just looking at packets

575
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,740
wetlands box

576
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,440
what's his company do

fatality

578
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,480
building that pat

579
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,780
you get a lot of information on how the
states

580
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,140
architect

581
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:30,650
so next that's almost you know it's
almost marcy

582
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:34,570
perhaps guys

583
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:36,190
loopholes

584
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:38,710
and from there and look at the

585
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,930

00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:39,300
the web interface

683
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,970
wellhead four points for the building
available

684
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:45,849
dishonesty hedonists it's just not

685
00:33:45,849 --> 00:33:48,559
important for all that but

686
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:49,650
facts that

687
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:51,410
you didn't get the layout of the
building

688
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:54,460
mrs read out twenty fourth's since

689
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:58,970
tears from me and all that

690
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,310
subtly work that way up

691
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:06,480
like people by phone

692
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,260
so right now is your medical records of

693
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:14,569
daughters you know that you were to work
with received here

694
00:34:14,569 --> 00:34:18,529
well rescuer rell

695
00:34:18,529 --> 00:34:21,919
factories

696
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:26,759
okay not lightweight did not like onion
talked like

697
00:34:26,759 --> 00:34:27,540
just came out

698
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,979
box

699
00:34:28,979 --> 00:34:33,809
just attacking t

700
00:34:33,809 --> 00:34:35,629
so all you're back up to the following

701
00:34:35,629 --> 00:34:42,169
unless you've been sending

702
00:34:42,169 --> 00:34:48,519
bethel quote

703
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:52,169
because the eighty eight accident on
this survey said

704
00:34:52,169 --> 00:34:54,689
and revising

705
00:34:54,689 --> 00:34:58,230
everything continues to work has more

706
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,869
he and notes okay

707
00:35:00,869 --> 00:35:03,179
at this point which makes it worse

708
00:35:03,179 --> 00:35:06,069
the notes even though this communication
is cut

709
00:35:06,069 --> 00:35:07,309
actor

710
00:35:07,309 --> 00:35:09,190
back to the break

711
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:12,269
facial concede function

712
00:35:12,269 --> 00:35:13,849
i don't like

713
00:35:13,849 --> 00:35:16,819
now i have been here but there are quite
access that but

714
00:35:16,819 --> 00:35:18,419
i'll tell you what would you please

715
00:35:18,419 --> 00:35:20,439
it was like a lot of them

716
00:35:20,439 --> 00:35:23,009
case you don't know who's used those

717
00:35:23,009 --> 00:35:24,260
in hebrews talked

718
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,380
utility joining

719
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:28,999
obvious wept for that was hip hop open
it

720
00:35:28,999 --> 00:35:34,199
gig schedule

721
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:35,529
five regulations

722
00:35:35,529 --> 00:35:39,729
star quality troubles

723
00:35:39,729 --> 00:35:41,369
date falls

724
00:35:41,369 --> 00:35:42,580
and the power of

725
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:45,859
just wait for just about priorities that

726
00:35:45,859 --> 00:35:52,859
double triple

727
00:35:55,179 --> 00:36:02,179
just a little once in a large too

728
00:36:12,209 --> 00:36:16,099
he didn't see it we might have been
trapped

729
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:20,959
hair

730
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:22,970
i don't expect that they are a

731
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,549
novato

732
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:26,499
was colors that are

733
00:36:26,499 --> 00:36:30,549
accidents accepted chart get at that
point

734
00:36:30,549 --> 00:36:34,219
and keep that

735
00:36:34,219 --> 00:36:37,459
i think this is where kickbacks

736
00:36:37,459 --> 00:36:40,829
reliable

737
00:36:40,829 --> 00:36:43,720
firework if you get out doing work

738
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,959
worries that's something that

739
00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:48,779
the schedule people consecutive weekends

740
00:36:48,779 --> 00:36:51,529
we circled and open source code

741
00:36:51,529 --> 00:36:54,749
authorized class over

742
00:36:54,749 --> 00:36:55,880
little judy

743
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,219
pacific passed away still

744
00:36:58,219 --> 00:37:00,490
echo fired back in the eighteen eighties

745
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:03,979
you can't all of you received it would

746
00:37:03,979 --> 00:37:05,339
and there was a

747
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:07,689
wasn't sure reached

748
00:37:07,689 --> 00:37:09,269
anyone workers

749
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:12,459
rooms would be

750
00:37:12,459 --> 00:37:16,160
bathroom breaks

751
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,569
huge fired by

752
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:21,229
and fifty women

753
00:37:21,229 --> 00:37:26,029
things don't change all the park

754
00:37:26,029 --> 00:37:27,689
solid upbeat about

755
00:37:27,689 --> 00:37:31,149
than your secretary

756
00:37:31,149 --> 00:37:37,159
surrogates enough

757
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:38,649
global warming

758
00:37:38,649 --> 00:37:44,449
or union

759
00:37:44,449 --> 00:37:47,279
but again you know i have been able to
verifier

760
00:37:47,279 --> 00:37:50,739
only had boxer mike drastically

761
00:37:50,739 --> 00:37:52,089
under me

762
00:37:52,089 --> 00:37:54,749
but you have the newest setup i didn't
have all that

763
00:37:54,749 --> 00:37:55,849
means-tested

764
00:37:55,849 --> 00:37:58,569
web interface in

765
00:37:58,569 --> 00:38:05,569
security

766
00:38:05,959 --> 00:38:08,269
all those vendors and i mentioned before

767
00:38:08,269 --> 00:38:15,269
somebody were back regardless by taxes
that

768
00:38:15,579 --> 00:38:18,509
to keep the makes u

769
00:38:18,509 --> 00:38:19,630
but one of those

770
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:23,299
school systems

771
00:38:23,299 --> 00:38:26,979
couple to talk about

772
00:38:26,979 --> 00:38:28,749
and what i really want to do

773
00:38:28,749 --> 00:38:32,410
is uh... you know if energy needs that
we want you to a spirited diversion

774
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,579
that's that's a great

775
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:37,209
report of your coffee pocket

776
00:38:37,209 --> 00:38:42,279
and tony echo buffeted star packers

777
00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:43,909
how do we get back

778
00:38:43,909 --> 00:38:46,099
okay pack species funded

779
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:48,199
you take a right off

780
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:49,259
for um...

781
00:38:49,259 --> 00:38:51,099
albeit not proper

782
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:52,440
forming a nonprofit

783
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,189
give tax break on that

784
00:38:54,189 --> 00:38:58,719
and get better stop

785
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:03,939
lor

786
00:39:03,939 --> 00:39:07,199
one thing i really want you to see you
again and again

787
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:08,989
indication here that i don't know

788
00:39:08,989 --> 00:39:10,309
rank somewhere

789
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:12,729
or abuse of a hard sell

790
00:39:12,729 --> 00:39:16,149
nothing like that

791
00:39:16,149 --> 00:39:19,740
this fresh

792
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:23,259
this route is what makes the system

793
00:39:23,259 --> 00:39:24,060
as forrest

794
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,389
within yet

795
00:39:26,389 --> 00:39:33,389
so matt contacts are

796
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,400
laura attacked him

797
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,909
through web interface

798
00:39:36,909 --> 00:39:38,559
authenticated

799
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:39,399
dalma

800
00:39:39,399 --> 00:39:42,029
buddies

801
00:39:42,029 --> 00:39:45,149
so all i said before right sequel

802
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:47,849
everything is packaged up and based

803
00:39:47,849 --> 00:39:51,589
you get the idea is to get out there

804
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:54,469
but there

805
00:39:54,469 --> 00:39:55,589
also attach

806
00:39:55,589 --> 00:39:57,219
declare

807
00:39:57,219 --> 00:40:02,099
select

808
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:06,019
feature to doctors have credit marketing
guy who's get back

809
00:40:06,019 --> 00:40:08,119
broadband service like orwell

810
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:09,180
but you know

811
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,609
those databases and will be

812
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:14,009
infectious

813
00:40:14,009 --> 00:40:21,009
which son

814
00:40:23,189 --> 00:40:27,939
the users

815
00:40:27,939 --> 00:40:32,619
yes i think i'd like to we get you know
numbers out there

816
00:40:32,619 --> 00:40:34,069
of the year

817
00:40:34,069 --> 00:40:39,689
yannick all identify factors abetted
vegetable patch

818
00:40:39,689 --> 00:40:46,689
and possibly getting remains directly
produced visit these stuff

819
00:40:50,229 --> 00:40:51,599
yesterday said

820
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:58,599
economic used et cetera itself

821
00:41:01,279 --> 00:41:03,479
what local format

822
00:41:03,479 --> 00:41:04,710
is that in order to

823
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:07,320
the brainstorm right got your notes

824
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:11,449
hook up the doors that means that this
would have to push out those policies

825
00:41:11,449 --> 00:41:13,889
and actually bility

826
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:20,889
each one of those notes

827
00:41:28,949 --> 00:41:31,269
wealthy

828
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:38,109
okay

829
00:41:38,109 --> 00:41:39,659
lee

830
00:41:39,659 --> 00:41:43,019
argh

831
00:41:43,019 --> 00:41:46,079
that's right yet strategy

832
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:47,819
so you know three questions

833
00:41:47,819 --> 00:41:51,589
where are those notes happy uh... the
capability

834
00:41:51,589 --> 00:41:54,809
memory

835
00:41:54,809 --> 00:41:56,269
seaview all that

836
00:41:56,269 --> 00:41:57,629
to uh...

837
00:41:57,629 --> 00:42:00,429
reports information dot master

838
00:42:00,429 --> 00:42:03,169
and uh... pupil postage stamp

839
00:42:03,169 --> 00:42:05,629
and i say you know even if that happens

840
00:42:05,629 --> 00:42:08,069
even if they are evil function

841
00:42:08,069 --> 00:42:11,609
when somebody back isn't that works at
record

842
00:42:11,609 --> 00:42:14,409
preprints backup for sport backup

843
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:16,459
of those losses which didn't

844
00:42:16,459 --> 00:42:20,519
work you have a little black government
of the good idea

845
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:22,759
who was coming and i have only where

846
00:42:22,759 --> 00:42:25,519
or is it pushed out of their testing

847
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:28,379
intercepted manufactured

848
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,189
that's that's good

849
00:42:30,189 --> 00:42:34,409
so we use just simply work sex with her
mcpherson

850
00:42:34,409 --> 00:42:37,459
you know all these shalala

851
00:42:37,459 --> 00:42:42,889
status

852
00:42:42,889 --> 00:42:44,429
exactly

853
00:42:44,429 --> 00:42:48,089
so it is the easy being

854
