for uh... interpersonal reaction if
you've ever been to make contracts has

00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,790
we have to direct

41
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,819
it works right and i want to be like
that but after talking it over

42
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:15,249
and respond distilling things to be
happy 'cause we will draft more abuse

43
00:02:15,249 --> 00:02:19,280
and if you ask us principally questions
or you know if after you do you want us

48
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:36,790
bit short of talking had to happen three
minutes minutes

49

not so what is this right i wish i was
used to this treaty all still that's is

50

56
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:02,279

drive-by listed

179
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,560
passing

180
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,450
instead

181
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,120
brings

182
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,750
and other government

183
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,970
how old is the

184
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:42,970
the

185
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:52,600
that

186
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,950
classless out for a couple of

187
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,670
as the

188
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,490
kiit

189
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,850
has

190
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,760
that's not good

191
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,370
exit

192
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:12,270
what was the reality guessing precinct
level

193
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:16,540
but it may be heading into us and i was
on the spot that does not need to try

194
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,450
this please write later

195
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,720
indicating and as part that good

196
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,160
one of the smaller and have preferred
wire they how they work with the

197
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,470
engineering behind

198
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:29,250
well doctrines that you can look at
what's actually going on inside of most

199
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,610
handcuffs maybe food using

200
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:38,610
and i've learned a lot to do

201
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,239
so continental court

202
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,680
such a personal there's not much going
on

203
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,230
you have this tragedy hot here

204
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,460
any helpful here with also rations

205
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,360
and his friend

206
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,390
and a lot more

207
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,710
soon because i did not

208
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:59,410
is matched by a dozen including one way
not another direction

209
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,600
so europe arrests in there

210
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,950
clampdown but can't get out

211
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,520
now and you don't want to hang tough

212
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,070
you helped me gain tighter either

213
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,760
these these require

214
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,560
it's pretty anywhere

215
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,230
interferes with the ball so that you
helped candidates higher

216
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,120
freedoms

217
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,550
and he keeps on m_t_v_

218
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,100
you know what

219
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:29,100
that's pretty much power and how it
works it's pretty simple

220
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:34,200
here's a video demonstration d_c_
depression are going in

221
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,630
upon clinton

222
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,270
you can

223
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,720
because india t

224
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,850
all he does

225
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,039
that is the

226
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:45,739
paul

227
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:47,660
admissions and when

228
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,590
so julia

229
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:55,710
there are not complicated what's going
on it's not hard

230
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:58,760
c hollywood gets a lot lot became really
braun

231
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,330
you know what people are coming out with
or ccr

232
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:07,090
like tv shows the substance of the hair
he cracks brite

233
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,900
there's also a real quick and you've got
a c on it

234
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,550
dcr

235
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,020
suggest in is using it

236
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,160
he's a battle

237
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,580
ends with the point where the you are

238
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,120
and police

239
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,130
mizrachi indeed dan

240
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,780
begins in the middle of a long

241
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,429
the forces and our way

242
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:33,910
and julia dharma

243
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:38,110
really quickly shipped a lot

244
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,440
using video of

245
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,730
in helping

246
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,720
done a lot

247
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,900
as easy to really done a lot more about
the way you works perfectly fine

248
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,500
but you don't want it

249
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,550
universes

250
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,069
malabar the way

251
00:12:53,069 --> 00:12:55,040
it's you know what works

252
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,040
nothing shouldn't work became

253
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,970
what does work you about c

254
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,640
covering the either way

255
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,750
kick it back

256
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,290
jim questions here haha three

257
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:10,010
and see how the actual oval office

258
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:13,970
didn't have joined models have different
methods of doing it some more about her

259
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:16,510
some are just a little all

260
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:19,250
magazines will circle here

261
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,339
would depend on the end of the keys

262
00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:27,030
but as for instigated malabar across

263
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:33,920
yes you're right mysterious

264
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:40,920
procedures little dot

265
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:52,820
actually ground here's the that's off

266
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,600
if you're really acts

267
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,130
or really there

268
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,330
the

269
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,720
doctrine

270
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,040
batteries in the final demand would you
agree

271
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,830
candidate

272
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:09,250
daily basis

273
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:13,760
cajun along side by side as all eat

274
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,190
is reminiscent of us here and that i
really a

275
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,820
represents the

276
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:23,710
initiating this instead of learning how
to manipulate outstanding outside on the

277
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:28,410
top and inspire backing he said you
pushed all his wrists

278
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,030
annual

279
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:32,130
citizenship

280
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:36,230
odd steve at my anyway

281
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:42,040
two years the

282
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,930
cell

283
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,759
justin arrives here

284
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:48,490
we're going to uh... granted their
sovereignty as a consequence she has in

285
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,270
house

286
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,470
and gets more potent right

287
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,480
they may still be excellent

288
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,170
these are big milestone

289
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:59,500
a alright appreciating his accident
there you get there

290
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,410
there

291
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:06,490
take months mohammed

292
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,770
expressed

293
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:12,990
so you're getting a hole inside these
all three of us like the shootout

294
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,519
before you can actually

295
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:17,800
gas though the ford mustang sorted out

296
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,010
just to start asap

297
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:24,050
councils

298
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:28,320
out some

299
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,010
israel's concept that subsequent
respectable

300
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:36,320
to shoot cataract

301
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:43,160
the status of the today

302
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,350

hip-hop

303
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:54,350

304
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,480
blazes decline

305
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,440
results there

306
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,140
my radar screens these days brightness

307
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,380
an actor

308
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:08,170
no matter you know i don't know how much
more than seven hundred

309
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:13,170
garnier

310
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:16,110
stored in the same is activated

311
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,230
desire

312
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:21,770
from one hundred

313
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,570
mentor

314
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:29,380
say you're sixty-odd consecrated
warranties

315
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:32,450
what's the context of that stuff on

316
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,820
fellow courses

317
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:40,090
along the matching santana

318
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,220
so yes

319
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,020
shipping incredibly incredibly easy

320
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,550
actually see though is that ok tak

321
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,079
just taking something

322
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,380
it became right

323
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:54,160
and check out the policies together to
have a copy

324
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,100
as i'm talking about the records of it

325
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,370
andre

326
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:04,370
cast

327
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:08,540
trustees not copy of it just a little
bit

00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:13,170
little belief

329
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:16,619
and get a lot of things stuff in became
with cops

330

and chandana all

331
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,850
composite off

332
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,300
i think it out

333
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,859

00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:59,010
excellent job

376
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:06,010
actually has a swedish police of the

377
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:10,450
catherine

378
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:13,670
x_-rays gonna get it right out we're
going to be done

379
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,930
the money is there

380
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:19,140
you had just witnessed us like blasting
through all these cops

381
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,860
and you might want to know what you did
a lot of people and how does cover costs

382
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,580
these files are all cops is lousy

383
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,950
if there is no not all custom is that

384
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:32,980
there are better quality tops are
covered in really well

385
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,039
the most common thing

386
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,409
e_v_a_ copy really tight tolerances

387
00:20:38,409 --> 00:20:41,230
if you make a handcuff if you can't
sleep shoes

388
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,480
visited schools into very easily

389
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,220
to be completely frustrated most of
these attacks

390
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,800
we try to get out of them on trying to
pick my way out of smith and wesson

391
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,490
acetic acid acid peerless doesn't seem
really nice france

392
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:57,840
unlike some other kind of that you don't
ask him about it

393
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,000
there much later that much harder to
only really getting their not mission

394
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,899
then you can probably count

395
00:21:03,899 --> 00:21:08,870
incompetently u_n_h_c_r_'s all you need
to do

396
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:11,700
so one more guests one more films

397
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:16,670
i know it has a few people it is taking
a wallet gold is like uh... of teleport

398
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,580
for knowledge penicillin condition

399
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:26,580
sorry guesses well i think you will try
to get out of these it was nuts

400
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:34,790
trusts u

401
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:39,460
carriers travis

402
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:44,750
so contacts

403
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,500
no

404
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,890
things

405
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,360
planning

406
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:57,040
ranging from abortion handing credit
expected the senate people don't look at

407
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,510
for example for the

408
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,050
uh... huh

409
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:04,460
so i can't wait out some of us

410
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,290
as the world's contact

411
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:14,290
stubble on the

412
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,370
you know i just got back from one side

413
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,870
philadelphia like this specialists

414
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,250
the

415
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,679
uh... unit

416
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:33,279
regular style cops can still be great if
their quote high-quality hymie psycho

417
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:36,150
high-quality cups there are few
manufacturers

418
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:41,010
making really pretty badass cops

419
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:44,120
of sweet athlete in

420
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,750
there are so many factions that need
really interesting things that are hard

421
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:52,650
not to shoot with tight tolerances
really liked it too

422
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,580
the most commonly happens

423
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,530
is vice listening depaul

424
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,140
involved with that

425
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,450
so mad little paper clip or something
going in there

426
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,690
you're not in a trip the entire paul
might catch part of it

427
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:05,720
but not all of it

428
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,760
the highest cops that are popular sees
through the u_s_ sometimes used to a

429
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,100
seasonal chicago cops as well

430
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,690
they all have to split paul

431
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:19,600
i have some cops from korea tom chang
gentler form of id reversed needs him

432
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,120
that's the company

433
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,080
occupied triples football

434
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,320
so it's a really why

435
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,730
really hard to depress all of the of the
planes at once

436
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:34,220
my favorite pastimes david cuts there's
concern always got the mail there's room

437
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:38,380
by another group com on walls holding
corinne answering

438
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:43,240
lonely and properly appreciated the love
that i have for the three docks

439
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,970
not only as a slip

440
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:49,120
loopholes for therein down his little
she notes

441
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,740
that you really can't get to from either
angle

442
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:57,100
is incredibly targeting their running
between them izzy blocking slowly it now

443
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:01,250
as actually critics of the scientist and
on the front seat can slip she visited

444
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,909
the press demolition

445
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:04,690
is really really nice

446
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:08,300
uh... there's even you know alleged on
the back into the bodies you can sleep

447
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:12,100
in the other way the new version has
something you can even see is

448
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,639
interesting little when the front pages
g_m_'s

449
00:24:15,639 --> 00:24:17,809
anything he strategy into their

450
00:24:17,809 --> 00:24:21,679
is really sick whereas at lapd blames
edwin

451
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:27,630
we want

452
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:31,309
so hit me up

453
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:33,090
was demoted from

454
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:36,350
there's actually revenues

455
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,940
and it's just for justice

456
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:42,590
i worked as a legal seventy-three she
asks so there is really really beautiful

457
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:46,830
cuts they're really will be

458
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:51,740
the products for the memorial stutterer
that constant using them

459
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,150
and these are the only cops action on
this year

460
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:59,400
completely agree with frustrate the d_c_
nine four nine a smirk beings and

461
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,070
pocketing like this after you know i
don't know i don't know how to get out

462
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:03,670
of them

463
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:07,959
ncd political for not getting s no way
to get you with us

464
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:10,350
they are really really sweet

465
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:13,520
so that's my little steel dot if your
actually want course but there are

466
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,450
really cool cuffs modified overseas

467
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,970
if you're a law enforcement or just a

468
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,620
inventions usana

469
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:25,580
there's something different comes into
play when you get all these

470
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:28,940
re-engineered variations in the design
house

471
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,010
you run into some trouble

472
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:33,660
the war we start tinkering with the
basic

473
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,740
cuff style

474
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:38,910
these are two incompatibilities
especially sports users

475
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:39,940
for example

476
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,290
one of the customer intermediary
suspicion i'll back you were going to

477
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:46,620
get people was that while we were
happier costco about

478
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:49,830
energy upstairs admission are around
brand

479
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:52,970
but the cop bomb is really thin

480
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:55,159
there's no standard standard sheet

481
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:56,730
for every kentucky

482
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,590
but there's not one standard size

483
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,190
perset

484
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:05,020
so that's why has this been most hancock
believes the belatedly y

485
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:08,650
so you can see that huge and so he was
not gonna turn

486
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,140
as part of late

487
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,160
is hitting

488
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,580
the bonds that make sense

489
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:17,990
so some companies actually manufactured
the calling of universal keys hightower

490
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:20,269
scheme very hot alan keyes

491
00:26:20,269 --> 00:26:22,780
you can buy support universal ki

492
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,130
it usually copies of it that way

493
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:29,120
cut down a little bit or believes that
we're just so smaller manufacturing and

494
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,580
ask for quality control

495
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:34,160
and so it was all over cheap involve
universal

496
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,240
that works really well on those basic
cuts including the house including

497
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,470
milligrams that don't have the right
size

498
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,380
where you start run into trouble

499
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,110
remember those multiple

500
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:48,590
paul and high security guards if you
have a lady

501
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,130
that is too small

502
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:54,130
any state in the cop of multiple faults
in might not trigger

503
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,600
all of the polls

504
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,510
candy is kind of learned
behind-the-scenes at what some of them

505
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,549
are going down

506
00:26:59,549 --> 00:27:00,640
cellmark

507
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,750
especially strong chances are so why

508
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:07,900
i've got blood to bleed champion between
two different paul horowitz went down

509
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,670
wants to admit it but the sponsor of
this

510
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,360
three different strengths

511
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,250
request is under three different springs
they are not

512
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,710
that's how people's

513
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:22,570
they might attack mts if you can get one
of the damn conflict visit when she

514
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:24,280
humans in the position

515
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:28,200
there are no holes prints is that was
the complete documents

516
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,320
unless they extend that walker twenty
only through everything spring and home

517
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,390
wholesome maybe you will do that

518
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:37,960
rules are coming on line in the
marketplace because they what content is

519
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,280
the awesome always find the product

520
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,050
misunderstand

521
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:47,390
winners and contacting running into
trouble

522
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:51,460
certainly just making up he believes to
small that will not solve all your

523
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,930
problems

524
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,119
so to all

525
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:56,270
and for the president would have
happened

526
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:58,980
he's already i'd be curious about this
for a while

527
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:04,780
i want to ask you guys informs exit
levees and also one of us problems

528
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,250
so start category

529
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:10,070
for the christmas meeting for the last

who need it as locks shop he has an
awesome collection

532
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,020
everyone raw all their collections

533
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:20,270
we don't everything comfortable which
was a lot more detail

534
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:24,159
but a lot of abu ali and she said no i
did some things for manufacturers that

535
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,730
they could use it was not there really
needs to

536
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:29,000
but i was interested

537
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,950
involved

538
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,429
involving a standard

539
00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:32,830
handcuff keys can

540
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:36,540
i said there's gotta be variation you've
got the every manufacturers will be

541
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,710
different

542
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:41,390
and why don't you know contract out to
treat you have additional help

543
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:43,620
which is wrong with me right

544
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:47,049
said eugenia solitude is bring this
design

545
00:28:47,049 --> 00:28:49,260
something that unfair

546
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,230
and i sat there just measurement sheets

547
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:56,280
just measuring all the copies of every
dimension i can't conceive cokie

548
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,330
basically

549
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:00,090
as you know she had been inner and outer
dimension

550
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:01,210
and then lady

551
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,020
dudley has been added overall

552
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:06,050
rise instead has served with

553
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:10,310
as a i wonder exactly across the
industry cross the world

554
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,520
what kind of irritation we're talking
about

555
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,050
some of those pretty much split all
letters that have walking piece is this

556
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:19,260
something that's flutes experiment

557
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,350
at least slot

558
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,270
all the data

559
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,989
which is a part of what is the biggest

560
00:29:22,989 --> 00:29:27,049
was paul is what smallest was the
standard deviation was the acting

561
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:28,020
strange

562
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:31,630
who's that we're going out with your
whose typical

563
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:35,789
has really fascinating things the
sixteen million dollars data

564
00:29:35,789 --> 00:29:36,770
i wonder

565
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:37,530
if they are

566
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:39,450
possibly even anytime

567
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:41,750
on ideals he didn't respond

568
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,230
in everything

569
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:46,940
as far as we can tell

570
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,120
behave thank you liane

571
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,190
knowing that it

572
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:53,500
but yeah interviews yes

573
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,299
so now total of one of the most part of
the like this but save your clothes for

574
00:29:57,299 --> 00:29:59,600
after this video because this

575
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,590
is what we ended up made

576
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:08,590
at the end of the

577
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:12,350
so challenging terrible

578
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:18,340
heroes but

579
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:23,870
it was a lot

580
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:28,760
with congress

581
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,929
with gestures

582
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:32,559
that all of us

583
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,080
these days

584
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,380
uh...

585
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:40,460
artist and i think

586
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:43,940
yourself

587
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:48,710
so i think the public office

588
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:51,800
can you tell us the any other way
interest

589
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,860
ascii

590
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:01,210
we've just witnessed

591
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:08,210
i speak yes sure applejack yes let me
ask you kath

592
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,980
involved

593
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:17,980
through the food right down the law

594
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:24,710
animals not art it's just a matter of
you know measuring

595
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:26,000
and i think the press release

596
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,400
really blew me away things so impressive

597
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,930
uh... we were hesitant referendum was
the last minute shoppers

598
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,409

neela do math

604
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,040
measuring

605
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:51,570
the same time feedback that was just
looking and at simpson's home idols of

tens of millions

614
00:32:08,499 --> 00:32:09,609
of what i've produced

615
00:32:09,609 --> 00:32:11,309
just by popular

616
00:32:11,309 --> 00:32:13,270
and

617
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:16,420
upon finding i see if someone's really

618
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:20,140
really committed to doing the job right
so i'm very proud of him we're very

619
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,940
pleased to call

620
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,470
so the issue he

621
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,230
allow delegates

622
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:29,440
in europe because we're litigating just
mentioned to you later

623
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,420
but elections are really simple

624

the dimensions art museum previous uh...
wheatland tribe election translator

625
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:42,210

to dance in the world like that

629
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:56,270
acutely testing the waters

630
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:59,520
uh... but yes i will be uh... we will

631

need license this certain organizations
who organizes a one e keys

632

i know what needed for a living he's
really sweet guy for on com units like

633
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,240
stuff there

634
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,760
mean-spirited cops he's interested
families analysts are orson

635
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,980
realizes it

636
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:19,020
uh... for people who've been responsible

637
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:22,770
beyond the licensing commercial side do
you really believe they release as a

638
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:27,530
nonprofit group tools has no problem
with you guys making santoro

639
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:32,360
uh... if you want to make them please do
and use them we'll show you some really

640
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,110
good tips about it

641
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:36,060
because it's so funny

642
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,290
if you want me is thought to sell

643
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:43,089
if you want to make this comes as cokie
design and don't like obviously

644
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:46,989
owner foundry in fact reinforcing you
know you don't have access to free

645
00:33:46,989 --> 00:33:47,669

industrial processes

647
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,340
is actually really trivial to do this

648
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:55,499
while i said well let's take a look at
using

649
00:33:55,499 --> 00:33:57,730
handcuffed he has a piece

650
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,750
as a starting point right

651
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:00,970
the ultimate ki

652
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:04,600
as of late wife clara's two point nine
builders

653
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,500
so that he did not sound of valor and
some of those building brands that are

654
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,679
too skinny

655
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,129
certainly not been able to use as
cheekbones

656
00:34:12,129 --> 00:34:17,709
it also has of late to reach deep enough
into cash for paul's some international

657
00:34:17,709 --> 00:34:18,419

658
