1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,560
private-sector probably why spend your
time

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,010
at the local level if you could be
making a lot more inside

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,659
finding either corporate workers set

4
00:00:12,659 --> 00:00:13,610
special

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,910
if we were thinking about proper
response investigation when it comes to

6
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,600
a different types the digital that's

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,589
costs thousands and thousands of dollars
to get all site license this week

8
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:30,059
and it's yours cerrito actually perform
the melts

9
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:34,359
so how do you know how much it cost
insight license for and face for ethnic

10
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:36,370
at

11
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,750
allotment right were talking about
thousands of dollars just for a while

12
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,130
licenses and yet

13
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:47,420
obsessing about eight good cybercrime or
computer crime unit

14
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,660
it's gonna cost a significant amount of
money

15
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,890
where do they state and local agencies
are not or most of the recent stadium

16
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:58,560
and your car's sight on street corners
war on drugs

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,510
streetcar probably it's a reasonable
idea right

18
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,520
growth for significant problem however
they are

19
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,880
parents concerned about

20
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,290
what's up

21
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,109
that's where we want a simple something
out

22
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:13,710
the resources

23
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,540
or proper investigation

24
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,520
we don't have staff they're gonna hang
around long

25
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,140
we also have this big challenge of a
black support the ban

26
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:27,220
for those of you in the private sector
how often do you run into batch after

27
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,210
trying to communicate things up the
ladder

28
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,549
all the time the same thing happens with
the police

29
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:35,740
someone might see

30
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,050
etc understand any issue

31
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,660
indicated to you

32
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:44,530
officer student working in law
enforcement for twenty thirty years they

33
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,459
might not

34
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:48,240
understand about u of computer

35
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,369
they might be thinking more in terms of
the latest wont work

36
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:54,810
were seen to be more unusual things the
catch on cd

37
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,360
about what his computer

38
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,790
envy limited amount of empirical
evidence that we have in other words

39
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:04,840
researchers have gone up in the
community can actually surveyed

40
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,370
state-level on four states

41
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:12,430
most of what happens appears to be
related to give a child order basis

42
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,539
for a communications or cyber stalking

43
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:21,059
and what insider stockings that data

44
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:27,069
i hope you have to go to bed well
alright

45
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:31,949
house yeah i'm sorry that might be room
for all

46
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:36,169
however as i burst out because the big
any kind of communications and that

47
00:02:36,169 --> 00:02:40,459
makes in reasonable person and that's
important information make

48
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:42,940
the reasonable person feel a sense of

49
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:47,949
fear or concern for their personal
safety and what their receipt

50
00:02:47,949 --> 00:02:49,309
by march

51
00:02:49,309 --> 00:02:54,209
most a personal opinion either some type
of sex frightened moment you're most or

52
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:55,559
adults

53
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:56,399
and

54
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:59,599
when we push this out

55
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,650
most of the research that's been done is
looked at certain states like michigan

56
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,769
or to a lesser extent

57
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,819
wouldn't push us up to the national

58
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:12,030
the last time anything reasonable was
conducted

59
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,930
was in nineteen ninety nine

60
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,129
and it was published in two thousand one
by standoff

61
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:20,439
and a few other researchers and this is
published by the national institute of

62
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:21,319
justice

63
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:26,719
it's this p dot m and basically assesses
the entire capacity of the survey of

64
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:31,289
agencies in terms of their ability to
respond to computer

65
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:33,830
these are very comprehensive definition
for both

66
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:36,719
electronic product for his computer
problem

67
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:39,519
and also one for collect right airbus

68
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,099
and looking at

69
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:43,129
these days

70
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:45,709
provides a variety of steps that

71
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:49,079
to take place richard improve the
response

72
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:52,590
generally speaking this afternoon says
we're not doing enough

73
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,050
at the state and local level

74
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:59,509
computer crime or electronic promise
something tell abhar interim deeply

75
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:03,029
this is a talk about the need for public
awareness campaigns pushed out hope the

76
00:04:03,029 --> 00:04:05,449
law enforcement and the general
community

77
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:09,029
if you want to talk to somebody who's
never going to actor conference before

78
00:04:09,029 --> 00:04:11,989
if that they don't know what happens
here

79
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:14,810
when i talk to people when i say i have
a hacker conferences

80
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,310
you think there's a lot of people for

81
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,389
we don't talk about burglary conferences
or anything like that if they don't know

82
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:22,370
right there

83
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,819
paralleled up

84
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:28,099
and so to advocate people about the
right of the things that happened would

85
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:29,919
help us quite a bit

86
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,049
out here in some kind of private-sector
site

87
00:04:33,049 --> 00:04:38,389
have significant issues with email
responses that don't dawn message it's

88
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:40,699
the people just

89
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:44,699
this morning before i left michigan i
had emailed him and ask you a campus a

90
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:49,210
major career credentials so we can
verify your email

91
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:53,120
within two hours and i should point out
to the entire campus saying hello

92
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,739
don't respond to this message

93
00:04:54,739 --> 00:04:56,740
yeah exactly

94
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,400
unfortunately to blame

95
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,800
soap opera where does this need not only
for a lot of course from a_b_c_'s with

96
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,589
the general population

97
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:04,400
also

98
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,150
we need better reporting and better data
of computer

99
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:14,190
so how do you know the primary resources
we have to nasty gate and understanding

100
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,070
frequency in prevalence of

101
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:20,880
real-world problems like robbery
burglary

102
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,459
and works on top of

103
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:27,069
something called a uniform crime report

104
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:31,300
uniform crime reports but by f_b_i_
every year

105
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,400
inspiring the statistics about every
problem that is reported to end on

106
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,949
fourteen pages

107
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:41,639
without saying that there is nothing
related to the computer crime at all

108
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,129
we had no idea

109
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:47,500
there's something called the national
isn't based reporting system remembers

110
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,539
and that hasn't made a unit about
computer

111
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:53,340
the likelihood of us having nightmares
data

112
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,710
that intelsat your current is probably a
decade or more away

113
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:01,280
suppressing any demonstrable
understanding of what happens with that

114
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,259
each city with the status

115
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:05,430
bearing very well

116
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,269
also

117
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:08,840
uh... any cssc easier

118
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,129
anne certified individuals and guts

119
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:15,729
favors the notion of developing
certifications before returning for law

120
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:20,689
enforcement so that way we don't have to
individuals with you beat for unusual

121
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:24,379
trait everybody's got something system

122
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:25,509
but usually

123
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:30,800
let's review some task forces for
distinctive electronic

124
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,479
at the state and local out

125
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:38,249
say they know how to a senior director
wanted that has such a

126
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:42,099
charo perhaps charlotte has its own
digital crimes unit

127
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:45,930
and that was set up to within the last
couple of years so this is a relative

128
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,649
increase in innovation

129
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:50,849
dossey updated lost the pharaoh in the
state

130
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:52,999
like that

131
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:55,690
it's not only does it run

132
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,219
marilyn

133
00:06:57,219 --> 00:07:01,619
how do you love her but porter case so
when you look at the moment congress

134
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:06,039
self as a consequence of messages on my
space

135
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:13,019
while i was interested in it is a very
hot

136
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:15,430
be computer fraud and abuse that

137
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,629
which is designed to prosecute computer
acting

138
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:19,970
mass

139
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,240
the creation of a false my space profile

140
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,030
so they had to stretch it to say that
she violated the and user agreement

141
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,610
provided by my statement

142
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,150
creating a fictitious personal

143
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,589
that's not very

144
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:37,280
we need better lost and this is just one
example of why

145
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,710
also they talk about the need for
greater cooperation high-tech industry

146
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,840
either of needy people

147
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,819
overactive semantics of microsoft's era

148
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:47,979
working with our state and local folks
leave no was that

149
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:51,280
special research and publications and
other words the individuals who were out

150
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,810
there and research community like myself
saying here's what we should be

151
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:55,690
concerned about

152
00:07:55,690 --> 00:08:00,169
here's where you need to be pushing your
resources as it relates to computer

153
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:03,789
also may have been studied built-in
bought it

154
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:04,930
are you wearing

155
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:07,879
party problem property

156
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:12,479
generally speaking there's not a lot
below these states that have uh... a

157
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,299
significant

158
00:08:13,299 --> 00:08:17,379
presence in terms of state financial
sector or giving sector generally

159
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:18,680
selected charlotte

160
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,700
there are individuals of the local

161
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,050
you have some connections with microsoft
the secret service

162
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:27,000
so there are those partnerships their
infrared is also good

163
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,380
a good better by which reminds us

164
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,260
these were relationships yet

165
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,870
yet there is a great staff it's
something that combines all these

166
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:37,580
different

167
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,790
cities to get

168
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,099
so there are against us thirty major

169
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:42,770
push these things for

170
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:47,270
but it's it's not a hundred percent
without a perfect and

171
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:51,980
better forensic tools investigative
resources nelson

172
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:56,990
talk about

173
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:59,110
various runs

174
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,440
wanted to know

175
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,090
police department

176
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,660
usability

177
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,880
you're not sure that you have to be
first

178
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,390
marketing europe

179
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:14,510
used which

180
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,660
very much different

181
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:20,190
and that's very true that doesn't care
do you want the idea is this

182
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,080
promulgated

183
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,390
within the law enforcement unit

184
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:26,400
investigate expenses without
understanding the general climate

185
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,510
which network soaker first responder one
should be able to do a scene where

186
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,529
there's computer

187
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,330
or buying or whatever

188
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,150
know what we're going to do with that

189
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,110
and that doesn't earlier complication

190
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,970
if you what does it for something to do
their job

191
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,890
do you want to have to work for five
years as a peacock

192
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:44,820
we're going to be able to

193
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,570
pushed him onto the jobs quickly as
possible

194
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,060
and that raises questions

195
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,820
for management about do we invest
thousands and thousands of dollars for

196
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,080
this person

197
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,100
words can we take somebody's s
inexperience person in these roles

198
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,440
there's a lot of complexity the takes
place

199
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,110
law enforcement agencies are really
difficult campbell store

200
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:09,820
and so forth austin has uh... either
colonel justice practitioners

201
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,500
work for you all as individuals working
in computer security or other apps

202
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,639
it's good to know what

203
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:17,320
prime news the good work

204
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,930
so they don't have a lot of
understanding what's that

205
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,730
if we don't know exactly what the
current client

206
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,770
for state and local law enforcement
agencies look like

207
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:26,869
then we need to do

208
00:10:26,869 --> 00:10:29,190
better examined

209
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,800
so one of the presidency in two days to
be sort of like a greatest hits

210
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,990
compilation

211
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:36,460
radical research projects that we have
you know

212
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:41,260
so wish touches on national issues
sandwich touch 'em issues here north

213
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,250
carolina

214
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,150
and another one of the texan she was
kind of a broader dynamic

215
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,350
additional forensic examination

216
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:51,560
if you have tort firing questions i'm
going to fall asleep strictly for that

217
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,320
right now

218
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,820
the first thing that we have

219
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,640
so we have a good nationally
representative sample uh...

220
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,910
law enforcement

221
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,410
operating at the stage for the local
level so we collected this with an

222
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,420
agency

223
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,320
federal law enforcement training center

224
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,190
which is centered at george

225
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:13,850
and they provide computer crime three
digital forensics training for law

226
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:17,980
enforcement agencies across the country

227
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,600
we're able to get four hundred thirty
seven individuals different agencies to

228
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,610
respond to assert

229
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:27,110
this is another databases ten thousand
indigenous

230
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,240
so what's that mean

231
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,000
with massive amount of time

232
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,500
for your response rate which is
relatively disappoint

233
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,279
this was wet

234
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,430
significance

235
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,260
cooperation

236
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,990
on flat seized

237
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,880
this is nothing against less if you are
with our response is just one of those

238
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,780
things

239
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,870
less than five percent is pretty well

240
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,630
what does that tell us well this is not
the generalize

241
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,620
will sample

242
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,050
but it gives us something to work

243
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:52,520
this is a convenient save the dates

244
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,990
so it's a lot of different questions as
it relates to you can cure i'm

245
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,209
cybercrime

246
00:11:57,209 --> 00:11:59,020
their investigative capacity

247
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,690
what their agency was

248
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,120
lanterns training to go

249
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,940
so this first so i was just kind of a
general demographic description on

250
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,690
in terms of the size of agencies

251
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:14,540
different places with more than five
thousand officers comprise a very small

252
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,030
percentage

253
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:19,490
cities are relatively small state

254
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,850
most of the sponsor right

255
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,700
ard twenty west or

256
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,960
two hundred where that states

257
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,000
and charged uh... population served

258
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,840
most of our

259
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,610
seized corroborate between five thousand

260
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:36,059
and twenty thousand people search these
are smaller

261
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:38,020
agencies and

262
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,340
what does that tell you

263
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,860
at practical levels that good bad
otherwise

264
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:47,550
for most places major cities with
billions millions of people

265
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:50,530
not related to the readers states

266
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:53,630
or any state really there's gonna be a
couple of population

267
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,450
obs

268
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,649
and it has to be a lot of outlined here

269
00:12:56,649 --> 00:13:01,750
so this touches on some of those
agencies that for the outlying areas

270
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,360
let's get some of the year issues here

271
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,520
what do you think about

272
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,370
agencies and officers frame one of the
things that's in

273
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:13,420
the last couple years is the importance
of officers and into or four-year

274
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,560
degrees

275
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,610
why would we want law enforcement
officers who have

276
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,520
college degrees

277
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,500
good evening

278
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:28,500
how do i have the is being lost

279
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,770
then i had a diversity of knowledge that
i know there was some concern which is

280
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:37,900
the high school that precedents there

281
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:42,489
personal seventy eight percent of the
agency's adolescent white officers

282
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,780
leaders who are for your degree

283
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,780
services

284
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,229
okay statis

285
00:13:48,229 --> 00:13:49,200
generally speaking

286
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,220
it's not great but it's a good start

287
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,740
we asked about how he helps if they
hadn't actually dealt with

288
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,750
developed retracted art out to some
degree

289
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:03,280
whether they look at computer forensic
issues computer crime issues online

290
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:03,649
prime

291
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:04,920
instigation

292
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,100
and most agencies

293
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:11,270
what works to full-time people assigned
to handle and angela

294
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,700
so forty percent

295
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,750
forty two percent had no

296
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:22,060
there's a basic example full-time
policies we have some places but parks

297
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,650
dot every agency has their own unique
first

298
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,980
in terms of officer training

299
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,580
we asked within a certain percentile

300
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,990
how many other officers have received
training as earlier stated

301
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,140
digital evidence

302
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,840
or online

303
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,890
outlined plans everything from sex
offenses to pack

304
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,990
and so working here

305
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:43,860
ten percent

306
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,090
well this is where most everybody falls

307
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:49,320
less than ten percent off their status
the experience

308
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,790
in either digital editing

309
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,680
point world

310
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,520
with digital at stand

311
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,830
if you were to walk out on the scene
with homicide arose that person is a key

312
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:02,480
ta or cellphone or oppressive and ipod

313
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,030
is expected within eleven survived what
effects

314
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,420
excellent

315
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,430
ideal

316
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:11,340
how do you have officers didn't know
what it's supposed to act

317
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:15,230
that's a relatively interesting point
this is just as they continue to improve

318
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,820
market

319
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,510
at the stake

320
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:20,990
local level in terms of officer training
aware

321
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:24,829
we also ask that brought a little what
type stuff computer crime

322
00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:28,370
investing

323
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,659
and identity theft

324
00:15:29,659 --> 00:15:32,110
comprise the race proportions

325
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,360
of investigation

326
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,410
so we're talking about financial crimes
lesser extent

327
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,230
individuals who received some kind of

328
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,380
threatening or hot

329
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,010
unfortunate personal email

330
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,450
child porn cases

331
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,230
solicitation killer

332
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,390
experienced

333
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:51,620
and their practical level sex frances to
be processed

334
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,440
for prostitution as well

335
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,810
or forty two percent

336
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,240
the lowest

337
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,570
hemingway acting entry what you think
that might be

338
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,390
and are

339
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,630
that helped us

340
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:12,630
hahaha

341
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,850
mahalo

342
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:23,850
absolutely that's a very reasonable
response coming up

343
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,540
better result using

344
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,450
agencies may or may not have a business

345
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:46,450
so i think also uh... at least

346
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:50,110
word crime

347
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,250
heartbreak

348
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,880
your scorecard

349
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,180
peacocks

350
00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:01,090
orchid

351
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:04,400
white or species

352
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,860
if you think about one of the bigger
cases here in north carolina

353
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,829
involved in a hacker initially

354
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:12,370
in wisconsin he major

355
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:14,549
hardware retain

356
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:15,720
you know that

357
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,110
so deep international dynamics in the

358
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,480
crossed state

359
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,590
it's making jurisdictional issues here
very complicated

360
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:25,760
so stay local agencies are best suited
to get a happy

361
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,300
brokerage responsive

362
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,529
that's another issue zero

363
00:17:31,529 --> 00:17:33,539
when we do have the agency's londoners

364
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:35,750
brothers but it's the f_b_i_ dot

365
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:40,210
so and investigated well most of what's
happening is related financial crimes

366
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,410
police expert

367
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:48,380
an intrusion much much less

368
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,990
vis-a-vis

369
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:53,550
personal successful

370
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,360
the

371
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,480
again write this book

372
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,820
that's very good point yes the u_s_
interactive cases in cases that are used

373
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,929
by rats

374
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:09,150
and simply reply rest started a final
solution wherein somebody has either

375
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:14,180
interested and prosecutor at least a
suspect was identified as musician

376
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,320
so this is a good start

377
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,500
as it relates to digital evidence

378
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,600
we see that most agencies

379
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,400
are in our

380
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,840
syrup category

381
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,200
followed by three to five said we want

382
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,260
at one level

383
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:30,890
between three to five cases and six and
nineteen case

384
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:35,570
miserable spaces are gonna fall so there
are some of the greek god

385
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,779
evidence cases that are at

386
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:43,779
yes feedback

387
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:48,380
that's that's pretty badly

388
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,460
now that's a very wonderful thing

389
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,690
practical

390
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:57,750
this is just again a sample of national
agencies or at least a nationally alarm

391
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,080
so this is limited to certain places

392
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:07,080
there are some states that are much
better than a yet

393
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,580
yeah

394
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:16,580
that block

395
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:24,800
so this is a certain individual the
state report

396
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:29,040
whereas all live for our so as to where
it might be talking about that

397
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,630
talk about or murder case might be

398
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:34,320
the jury on and as your other places

399
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,970
point seven percent are responding
agents thomas twenty eight percent

400
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:43,660
sedan zero active cases right now

401
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:47,269
and relatively significant appears the
navy seats

402
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,490
for ninety days

403
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:52,380
cases cleared by rats the divers part

404
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,140
much more significant bc possibly

405
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:59,320
few cases they're convicted felons but
later online crime

406
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,440
that lead to a clear buyer s out

407
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,650
tells me

408
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:06,490
didn't like

409
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:09,740
would we get away with it at the state
level up

410
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,680
potentially if you don't mind

411
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,660
there are some

412
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,280
lightly i guess

413
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,620
beautifully say there's something
interesting about the difference

414
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,140
we active

415
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,430
we're

416
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:28,430
and seventies hero i want you know
that's that's a bad signs

417
00:20:28,629 --> 00:20:29,919
privacy aboard a vessel

418
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:30,929
technologies

419
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,250
you can't get away with federal credit
union

420
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:36,920
but it's a little while this is an
interesting issue

421
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:41,779
we also asked the individual response to
give us some of their perceptions about

422
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:43,130
computer

423
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,090
and so we broke down

424
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:49,120
certain statements and ask how much do
they agree or disagree with what is

425
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,320
provide

426
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,400
for steve forbes computer crime is a
serious

427
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,870
american society

428
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,500
thankfully

429
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:02,539
most all respondents agreed with this
ninety eight percent

430
00:21:02,539 --> 00:21:07,480
but in terms of opened here trying to
track officers tension away from st dot

431
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,730
so is this universe is saturday man

432
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:14,760
there is some disagreement but there's
also pretty healthy enough of ivory

433
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,210
subtle ways that being a practical

434
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,279
with law enforcement see there is some

435
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:25,200
research suggests there so altered

436
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,020
accords with the law enforcement eighty
years india at buster

437
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,620
problem solver india albert

438
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,929
really helping anybody investigating a
crime where there might

439
00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:39,550
it cleared by rest where they might not
be a suspect in the tag

440
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:42,970
and so far right that effecting the
perception of him

441
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,410
within along coordinated

442
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:50,620
we asked how many citizens and community
understand the risk computer

443
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,720
most everybody disagree with

444
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,710
seven interest we might get it to some
degree

445
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:59,220
but the population that answer does not

446
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:04,000
we also asked about the issue of science
fair so attacks on computer systems pose

447
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,850
a threat people to work greater than
physical attacks

448
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:11,990
most individuals agree

449
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:15,100
on the whole political

450
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:21,920
baseball buddy res

451
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,710
that you'll see that

452
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,600
might or might not serious

453
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:32,600
war dates with them

454
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:39,760
very point i'm guessing ira form design
testing

455
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,240
with kevin smith is a cougar ackerman
institute

456
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,200
unfortunately does play into some
individual process

457
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,779
yes to control about this a little bit
later on and certainly not touched on

458
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:52,830
that

459
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:56,340
but now that my have sunk perspective

460
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,500
uh... back

461
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,340
uh... i was was interviewed by a french
documentarian sits in his backyard for

462
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,420
really gonna happen

463
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,370
no armed forces

464
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:07,620
waiver i had a fire sale

465
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,450
however that are going on

466
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:12,650
outside art form

467
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,990
that's not

468
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:18,410
sound that might have some

469
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:22,150
well it's not super sexual questions
about unity will attend

470
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:26,540
so there's a sugar majority computer
crimes were perpetrated by individuals

471
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,380
in their teens one

472
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,179
so in other words younger individuals
engaged

473
00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:32,260
these days

474
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,500
there's mixed response

475
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,410
just out of curiosity what's the local
category

476
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:41,440
four appending as a whole

477
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,950
street talked that most people to be
done

478
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,080
younger

479
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,940
practice by large younger persons gave
you look at the demographic coupons

480
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,250
when we think about computer problem
senator

481
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:58,860
five years and that might be what i've
seen this kind

482
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:02,740
we also asked how many computer
terminals offer to resign for comfort

483
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,970
so there is the standard of living
abroad

484
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,909
database responsi

485
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:08,710
and that might be a portion of the fact
that

486
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,750
there is something that shirt actors

487
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,730
that engages debate

488
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:14,760
so this isn't necessarily a bad

489
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,270
it's just another question

490
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:20,670
we also asked about

491
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:24,130
recognition of computers abby

492
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,500
different from the street

493
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,650
so we've got the same computers allow
individuals to feel less responsible for

494
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:30,649
that

495
00:24:30,649 --> 00:24:33,650
thereby increasing the likelihood of
prop

496
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:36,880
ninety percent of the individual zagreb

497
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,830
anybody heard of charm d individual
asian before

498
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:43,060
about the x

499
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:46,460
webpage that sure lets the individual
eighteen years

500
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,800
to review the razor and they bring up

501
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:55,800
yet it's like taking a person in boston

502
00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:02,050
and one of the military

503
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:06,670
normally

504
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,380
with an average of all of our

505
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:12,110
we might be able to say that you can see
your email blast and when that person as

506
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:17,880
you know watched their response

507
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,630
minnesota replacement user cannot

508
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:22,200
response on the median comment

509
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,430
when you post n birthday

510
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,429
yes sir

511
00:25:25,429 --> 00:25:27,310
doesn't hahahahaha

512
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,700
here's a guy who's afraid of what

513
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,550
based on food every day but it was
something that has something very late

514
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,890
at night

515
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:38,740
it has been expanded can

516
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:42,880
regarding the

517
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,870
happy

518
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:48,700
that doesn't have to be something that
we like track

519
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,080
we take away their do some research in
this area to do about the issue of

520
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,950
leaders

521
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:58,760
some support for kids psychological
construct that we don't understand the

522
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,170
it's a relatively new wife as they think
there's that much

523
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,460
agreement with that state

524
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,840
from a lot of course

525
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,560
but it didn't win but could you please
be beaten

526
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,590
now the candidates he was like

527
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:17,860
uh... well if you think about metaphase
short then the one responsible

528
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,620
to some degree

529
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,450
discomfort

530
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,429
complex same

531
00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:24,460
thinking about personal

532
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,410
america is a real person on the other
hand written off

533
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:30,030
when it comes to be facing web site

534
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:33,940
really physically impacting somebody
aside from the spirit personal within

535
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,350
that agency

536
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:42,350
bad publicity

537
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:49,440
i don't know who properties dot com

538
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,279
sock hop

539
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,309
except perhaps reluctantly

540
00:26:53,309 --> 00:26:56,450
factory we didn't ask a lot of fender
they

541
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,150
but that's important

542
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:02,700
of the last point that has some value
you're going to get to your attention

543
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,909
is the issue of hot in here

544
00:27:04,909 --> 00:27:05,700
so we asked

545
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,340
two questions related to computer act

546
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,400
first and foremost convicted that they
should be allowed to work

547
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,940
you've got

548
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:16,520
most people disagree with that state

549
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:20,610
the same way his victim actors should be
allowed to have a computer at home

550
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:23,510
eighty six percent disagree with that
statement

551
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:24,920
so anything custom

552
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:29,990
the guidelines that are provided in
terms of how we deal with that

553
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,620
their support for that one person

554
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:38,620
you have the local

555
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,870
surgery

556
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:47,960
macabre

557
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,760
it said incident

558
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:55,220
on the one hand there are certain fences
where it would definitely say computer

559
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:58,240
uses twenty initially like making
arrests have will

560
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,850
or children solicitation gaining access
to the computer where you might find

561
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,690
others who support your behavior

562
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:08,230
can't holding the gates of the he
groaned cognitive therapy for a fight

563
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,580
you'll those please

564
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:13,840
is it fine if needed support other
that's going to totally demolishing

565
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,270
things that dot

566
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,850
when it comes to computer hacking

567
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:21,230
yes there's benefits having access
technology

568
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:23,350
wilson negatives the console

569
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:26,109
uh... alligator read the manual

570
00:28:26,109 --> 00:28:29,320
that's provided by the u_s_d_a_ okay

571
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,530
sensing options when it comes from here

572
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,970
buried here

573
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:38,299
and some of your wolverhampton hugs

574
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:43,700
uh... discussions on this issue has been
delayed steered here use

575
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,320
and i think it's

576
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,220
vary depending on individual offender
and what they did

577
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,590
so don't speak

578
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:53,990
general abstract say sentencing
guidelines of the referees and hopefully

579
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,890
there

580
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:56,380
appropriately applied

581
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,660
elissa mixes

582
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,040
we also i think you'll see why

583
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,009
wearing

584
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:04,460
lets certain countries in terms of their

585
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,570
records that were attacked

586
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,830
and so when you think about

587
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,160
siders terrorism

588
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,050

related to

brazil

607
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:03,620
no we didn't get to the sources can be
touched on it

608
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,070
what countries

609
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,820
civic pride that this less

610
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:11,460
where if you break these countries in
terms of their threat outside

611
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,980
so

612
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:16,570
and that's very well be the less they
came up with me try to base his partner

613
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:18,410
general awareness huh

614
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:22,270
eight countries national perspectives on
site let me know that there's a has a

615
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,660
significant problem

616
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:27,170
as released and fishing financial texts
era

617
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:28,970
china and russia theirs

618
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:32,550
rolls of reports about their of
terrorist attacks eyes

619
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,500
the russian injury

620
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,590
wins against various countries

621
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:36,720
but we also frantic

622
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,260
introducing controls

623
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:42,420
with regard to different nations that
might just into our general dynamic of

624
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,200
terror

625
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,470
like iran

626
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,430
rock

627
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:47,309
uh... injured afghanistan

628
00:30:47,309 --> 00:30:52,360
in charge of the potassium afghanistan d
actress for side effects anybody think

629
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,940
that's a significant drastic rap

630
00:30:55,940 --> 00:31:00,600
testing we don't know arson shouldn't be
that types are relatively small in

631
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,389
afghanistan so

632
00:31:03,389 --> 00:31:08,240
which had provided some better i wish we
could it be successful results lion

633
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,700
share and feel respect

634
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:15,900
so we asked them on a scale from one two
five one the was fighting acts

635
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:19,060
these meetings gave us a sense of where
people fall in terms of

636
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,509
most significant

637
00:31:21,509 --> 00:31:24,630
at least most state and local agencies
but china

638
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:25,800
number one

639
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,080
given there's so much penetration

640
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,179
within the

641
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:33,830
that china as a significant cyber graff
amounting to usd other countries

642
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,770
that's good

643
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:37,330
seeing russia out here

644
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,620
around

645
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:42,059
to hear a lot about arriving in actors

646
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:44,240
not really

647
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,140
there is some research to suggest that
are running hackers

648
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,370
rising actively engage in cyber attacks

649
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:52,410
they don't have to cut

650
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,490
has to do it affected

651
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:57,530
but babies have the motivations

652
00:31:57,530 --> 00:32:01,130
sistine here is not necessarily staffing

653
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:03,110
for a particular spirit

654
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:05,280
seeing a rock

655
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,320
extended up a little bit lower

656
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,630
again not necessarily have to just get
this in perspective

657
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:16,520
with the romanian we always hear about
me

658
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,200
no loss loss of computer company

cardigan indignation

660
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:27,040
definitely last financial european-style
distributed its it's a relatively safe

661
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,080
haven for that

662
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,140
resulting ranks as well what was the
right

663
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:32,950
overall

664
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:33,940
this election

665
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,739
yet foreign company

666
00:32:35,739 --> 00:32:37,159
bergiy but uh...

667
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:39,490
u_s_a_ with

668
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:42,210
good question why did we put the u_s_
here

669
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,260
we try to make this list is relatively
inclusiveness

670
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,480
formation

671
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,019
we get one of the u_s_ because we
thought were talking to you law

672
00:32:50,019 --> 00:32:53,029
enforcement officials here at the state
and local level

673
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:57,090
so we thought they were really perceived
individuals within their jurisdiction as

674
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,880
a

675
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,330
so to include again ideal

676
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,830
little

677
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:03,929
bit overkill

678
00:33:03,929 --> 00:33:06,820
we might get some mixed messages

679
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,960
but you're right that is something that
we need to consider given that there are

680
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,060
individuals in the u_s_ were still
engaging now

681
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:16,780
there are he ha sites that are listed
here at the u_s_ which is scaring

682
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,570
another seller dignitaries

683
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:21,380
burn

684
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:25,060
but we try to keep the survey as simple
as possible so that's why i said metrics

685
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:29,300
occurred here parker forget reads

686
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,560
we also asked about the perceptions

687
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,370
crime reply

688
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:36,860
so we asked questions about both
physical offenses

689
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,160
and computer-based defense

690
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,010
and against that

691
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:42,100
one to five skit

692
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:45,130
sold one being los five e acts

693
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,630
and things of fallout of this one

694
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:47,720
with the needs

695
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,759
socio something worth less than five
dollars is relatively

696
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:56,070
less severe than other offense something
you would agree with that

697
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:58,920
regarding candy bars

698
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:04,830
wireless staff comes in next and review
that was done

699
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:07,020
hello everyone

700
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:10,259
interested recently retired as the next

701
00:34:10,259 --> 00:34:12,349
oh hartsfield media

702
00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:14,499
you know what happens

703
00:34:14,499 --> 00:34:17,859
certain relatively low correct that's
sensible right

704
00:34:17,859 --> 00:34:21,859
still something worth more than fifty
dollars begins to broach are sort of

705
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:23,619
been point

706
00:34:23,619 --> 00:34:25,589
followed by software piracy

707
00:34:25,589 --> 00:34:26,260
although i do

708
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,109
i think there might be

709
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:32,869
stopper aristide graders mary unifier
standoff

710
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:34,719
possible

711
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,439
isn't it funny

712
00:34:36,439 --> 00:34:43,439
greater business loss yet

713
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:48,269
we can get cds for writing a different
outlets how do you do

714
00:34:48,269 --> 00:34:52,639
probably not but how did he recalls the
example of the reagan

715
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,579
that planet

716
00:34:55,579 --> 00:34:57,489
itself but it's something that

717
00:34:57,489 --> 00:34:59,019
relatively available

718
00:34:59,019 --> 00:35:02,199
such important points or

719
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:07,019
as we move further of this error agency
we see purposefully damaging property so

720
00:35:07,019 --> 00:35:10,989
this is a passport in terms of repeated
vehicles and buildings

721
00:35:10,989 --> 00:35:12,649
this sort of are good

722
00:35:12,649 --> 00:35:14,859
fall back on line harassed

723
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:19,789
so at reports six eight this is again
getting a little bit more severe

724
00:35:19,789 --> 00:35:22,690
followed by breaking into a building or
vehicles worth that

725
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:24,489
three twenty eight two

726
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:27,349
young jane eyre without permission is
just slightly

727
00:35:27,349 --> 00:35:30,739
higher than breaking into a building
where people

728
00:35:30,739 --> 00:35:34,559
grieving about it

729
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:36,599
amplifiers

730
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:38,430
what type of date

731
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:41,909
at practical level we didn't get the
specifics about

732
00:35:41,909 --> 00:35:43,840
tight update rather distant

733
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,989
you can't deny without permission

734
00:35:45,989 --> 00:35:47,549
from the individual

735
00:35:47,549 --> 00:35:51,779
so this is really something that might
suggest dash these two items are aim to

736
00:35:51,779 --> 00:35:53,249
gather a little bit

737
00:35:53,249 --> 00:35:56,919
so while they were all primate any
europe is fine

738
00:35:56,919 --> 00:35:58,640
appear fall into some

739
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,660
degree of sin

740
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:03,220
places there nationally there are
certain types of information there much

741
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,149
more work

742
00:36:04,149 --> 00:36:04,869
dangerous

743
00:36:04,869 --> 00:36:08,749
receipts or release them out but at
least this is this is a unique i think

744
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:12,029
that's all

745
00:36:12,029 --> 00:36:13,869
process

746
00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:17,209
hahahahahaha

747
00:36:17,209 --> 00:36:18,849
art

748
00:36:18,849 --> 00:36:21,029
that's been a while

749
00:36:21,029 --> 00:36:22,839
actually

750
00:36:22,839 --> 00:36:26,129
how are you working for the year that i
actually tried some of the individual

751
00:36:26,129 --> 00:36:29,089
attendees at this time

752
00:36:29,089 --> 00:36:33,239
given the high response rate in china

753
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:35,849
i don't want to ask me questions again

754
00:36:35,849 --> 00:36:39,739
but most are not the system last less

755
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,549
reliable then

756
00:36:41,549 --> 00:36:44,569
here but that's a very good point we're
going to see differential attitudes

757
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:45,979
based on the op-ed

758
00:36:45,979 --> 00:36:49,729
computer security professionals migrated
these things drastically different even

759
00:36:49,729 --> 00:36:50,829
actress

760
00:36:50,829 --> 00:36:53,109
regressive their adult perspective

761
00:36:53,109 --> 00:36:55,269
might read these things different

762
00:36:55,269 --> 00:36:58,660
and that's a good point given the chance
of a better degrees it's just a little

763
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:01,469
bit higher than you do

764
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:06,429
how did you ever face when he said

765
00:37:06,429 --> 00:37:08,979
the violence that have happened

766
00:37:08,979 --> 00:37:10,380
faggots denies

767
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,429
for the sake of

768
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,049
same argument

769
00:37:13,049 --> 00:37:17,789
i think i don't know how r infection so
he specifically said viruses or other

770
00:37:17,789 --> 00:37:21,409
types of malicious software factions
distribution

771
00:37:21,409 --> 00:37:22,480
this is over

772
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,400
who are quite parties about four point
two percent

773
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,419
metheny so that means this is much more
severe rather actions

774
00:37:29,419 --> 00:37:32,769
that's a good thing right that
law-enforcement agencies are able to see

775
00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:33,719
yes

776
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:36,289
and viruses spread across the network is
bad

777
00:37:36,289 --> 00:37:39,970
that's a good start state local agencies
getting that's a good thing

778
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:41,609
trackback the body

779
00:37:41,609 --> 00:37:43,349
be higher than our

780
00:37:43,349 --> 00:37:45,259
another group and i said

781
00:37:45,259 --> 00:37:48,349
interesting that electronic should money
go

782
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,450
relatively

783
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:55,069
just slightly was selling hard drugs
such as parents

784
00:37:55,069 --> 00:37:59,549
why do you think there may be some
conversions listed dot

785
00:37:59,549 --> 00:38:00,969
speedway

786
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:04,019
steveomonkey drugs there happens to
these reports about the relationship

787
00:38:04,019 --> 00:38:07,410
between methamphetamine users and
computer crime

788
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,569
vice-president

789
00:38:10,569 --> 00:38:14,569
he's gone

790
00:38:14,569 --> 00:38:18,109
everyday the yet

791
00:38:18,109 --> 00:38:20,289
any x

792
00:38:20,289 --> 00:38:23,679
out

793
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:27,539
excellent point if we're talking about
first responders people who might

794
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:31,499
previous standpoint as a blackouts or
something he's going to see murder as

795
00:38:31,499 --> 00:38:32,759
one of my feet

796
00:38:32,759 --> 00:38:34,759
they might feel that there is some

797
00:38:34,759 --> 00:38:38,869
comparison between those type those
tubes tied to the fed's subject

798
00:38:38,869 --> 00:38:40,999
victim is heard

799
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:44,089
better start race we could make the same
argument yourself

800
00:38:44,089 --> 00:38:47,409
hard drugs some people argue it's the
fault of the buyer

801
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:49,719
and i'm certainly itself as the audience

802
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:51,359
blessed myself

803
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:55,559
like at that point we don't necessarily
know through the victims are we haven't

804
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:58,689
argument once a victim says this is
what's happened we don't have the

805
00:38:58,689 --> 00:38:59,719
offenders

806
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:03,709
there's some complex some complex
features those relationships

807
00:39:03,709 --> 00:39:07,789
west-northwest

808
00:39:07,789 --> 00:39:11,059
is that child form solicitation online

809
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:13,279
so we could make this point specifically

810
00:39:13,279 --> 00:39:17,339
individuals who either obtain child
pornography or solicit it's their son

811
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:19,589
internet based

812
00:39:19,589 --> 00:39:21,139
is actually

813
00:39:21,139 --> 00:39:22,950
envelope physicals very fast

814
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,779
inside a terrorist act

815
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:28,579
what i think that might be

816
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:31,859
let

817
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:36,069

00:39:55,779 --> 00:40:02,779
slightly

826
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:08,069
people

827
00:40:08,069 --> 00:40:09,789
now look forward to mention

828
00:40:09,789 --> 00:40:12,229
and i don't believe the spirit of
beginning

829
00:40:12,229 --> 00:40:16,489
all he had the chance to respond at gone
through computer crime where people for

830
00:40:16,489 --> 00:40:17,069
instance

831
00:40:17,069 --> 00:40:19,329
bringing for law enforcement said

832
00:40:19,329 --> 00:40:23,539
so what i can certainly be specialists
they've received some kind of advanced

833
00:40:23,539 --> 00:40:28,979
training over about when might we see
the police academy or otherwise

834
00:40:28,979 --> 00:40:32,529
in light of the house passage of that
before response to the problem

835
00:40:32,529 --> 00:40:34,379
uh... it could be any number of

836
00:40:34,379 --> 00:40:36,500
the votes that that would be great

837
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:40,549
uh... i realize that at least few
minutes to wrap up services

838
00:40:40,549 --> 00:40:44,709
i would be really tired at princeton

839
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:45,989
works out better

840
00:40:45,989 --> 00:40:49,589
ltd

841
00:40:49,589 --> 00:40:52,030
we also asked about the frequency of

842
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:53,989
computer crimes general

843
00:40:53,989 --> 00:40:56,289
again from a scale

844
00:40:56,289 --> 00:40:57,150
actually inside

845
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:00,909
one two six sixty must report one being
that

846
00:41:00,909 --> 00:41:02,900
offer responses these days

847
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,950
for our the well

848
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:07,709
so they think these things are happening
radio

849
00:41:07,709 --> 00:41:10,079
so we have some adverse terror attacks

850
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,079
falling

851
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:12,479
for so sort of these

852
00:41:12,479 --> 00:41:13,519
least

853
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:17,029
lightly but happening regularly five

854
00:41:17,029 --> 00:41:19,389
bottom line here inform

855
00:41:19,389 --> 00:41:22,919
music piracy in software piracy

856
00:41:22,919 --> 00:41:24,809
first overall frequency

857
00:41:24,809 --> 00:41:28,789
i didn't agree with that

858
00:41:28,789 --> 00:41:30,329
but this is a respected

859
00:41:30,329 --> 00:41:33,469
very good point we see this immediate
change

860
00:41:33,469 --> 00:41:36,749
from the securities not likely to be at
that

861
00:41:36,749 --> 00:41:40,479
also workout or the solicitation
following appears slightly below

862
00:41:40,479 --> 00:41:43,369
software ours

863
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:47,069
most agencies again or invest in
different types of behaviors and so if

864
00:41:47,069 --> 00:41:49,959
there's anything to help or cases on a
regular

865
00:41:49,959 --> 00:41:52,189
procedures to be more frequent

866
00:41:52,189 --> 00:41:55,389
want to know about supper piracy music
piracy generally

867
00:41:55,389 --> 00:41:59,799
didn't most people regardless of age
demographic characteristics otherwise

868
00:41:59,799 --> 00:42:03,089
engage in some forms of piracy

869
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:06,629
practically speaking yes there's a lot
of it

870
00:42:06,629 --> 00:42:12,139
so that i could press right

871
00:42:12,139 --> 00:42:14,059
we estimate that all students

872
00:42:14,059 --> 00:42:18,319
rank their awareness of the meeting at
different times

873
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:19,419
so

874
00:42:19,419 --> 00:42:24,180
we asked about different technical terms
as well as different types

875
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,019
concerned with

876
00:42:25,019 --> 00:42:29,229
firewalls cookies spyware adware

877
00:42:29,229 --> 00:42:35,349
factually most people seem to have some
idea of what that carries are all

878
00:42:35,349 --> 00:42:38,559
won't lower on an american that's that's
a good sign might have some recognition

879
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:39,739
but the

880
00:42:39,739 --> 00:42:41,559
and spock spam

881
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,489
high response rate here

882
00:42:43,489 --> 00:42:50,489
waiting podcasts might be a little bit
more than a minute

883
00:42:50,529 --> 00:42:52,429
so i i don't know about

884
00:42:52,429 --> 00:42:54,119
catalog

885
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:56,199
that's very important that you might

going to get to go

912
00:44:04,589 --> 00:44:08,410
conversing other oneself please feel
free to hang out later we had a picture

919
00:44:22,589 --> 00:44:25,699
there seems to be some recognition up

920
00:44:25,699 --> 00:44:28,669
technology issue so they seem

921
00:44:28,669 --> 00:44:31,009
firewalls are buddies

922
00:44:31,009 --> 00:44:32,109
buttons to push that

923
00:44:32,109 --> 00:44:35,099
simple operations it's not certainly
there

924
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:40,599
ostriches also appear to be informs
general research that

925
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:43,639
with regards to antes for here

926
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:46,600
people concerning the general population
concerning

927
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,949
whether or not hacker should be allowed
to have access

928
00:44:48,949 --> 00:44:50,229
here's either

929
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:53,239
whether as a consequence of the gallup
poll

930
00:44:53,239 --> 00:44:58,489
most people say you don't get the maxis
their sadness responsibly

931
00:44:58,489 --> 00:45:01,769
but the good thing is that they seem to
state that people in their community

932
00:45:01,769 --> 00:45:03,829
don't understand your

933
00:45:03,829 --> 00:45:06,619
but at least tells us law enforcement
seems to me

934
00:45:06,619 --> 00:45:09,440
catch some comprehension of the problem

935
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,969
necessarily so

936
00:45:10,969 --> 00:45:12,119
warm-up

937
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:15,539
how do you agree with that people
outside of a conference like this group

938
00:45:15,539 --> 00:45:18,359
will get

939
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:20,309
okay with that

940
00:45:20,309 --> 00:45:24,969
the issue related to book computer
offending and we're opening scene some

941
00:45:24,969 --> 00:45:27,170
similarities here based on severity

942
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:29,660
sort of interesting we have a look at
this and

943
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:33,629
practical level as criminologists and
promote suspected

944
00:45:33,629 --> 00:45:35,869
often said that these behaviors

945
00:45:35,869 --> 00:45:39,629
but it's important to be addressed how
those two things signup is there any

946
00:45:39,629 --> 00:45:43,589
relationship and what does that went to
at a bar

947
00:45:43,589 --> 00:45:49,219
response the antigens lessons
infiltrated email me a whole

948
00:45:49,219 --> 00:45:52,839
he had an issue that you sports tonight

pain marshmallows

950
00:45:54,279 --> 00:46:00,529

that was actually a com disputed second

fansite greatly appreciated began to
question starling community

952
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:16,670
we're at the mouth researching laura

953
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:24,539
speakers from all

954
00:46:24,539 --> 00:46:26,349
actually pretty

955
00:46:26,349 --> 00:46:30,039
if you're in

956
00:46:30,039 --> 00:46:34,419
articles and thank you

957
00:46:34,419 --> 00:46:41,419
who probably won't indicators

958
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:47,799
bowman talking to use the link between
the two that was the aggregate result

959
00:46:47,799 --> 00:46:51,199
for example

960
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:52,890
gentleman

961
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:59,890
probably will not be smarter

962
00:47:01,129 --> 00:47:02,499
probably is

963
00:47:02,499 --> 00:47:09,499
anytime minutes go

964
00:47:28,299 --> 00:47:35,299
