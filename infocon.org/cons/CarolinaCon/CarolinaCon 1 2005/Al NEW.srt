what buffalo does that mean

59
00:02:50,619 --> 00:02:53,049
basically what it means is that i have
talked

60
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:53,910

00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,110
it's very difficult to get these doctors
that they're not smart enough to treat

00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,639
patients

69

00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:20,669
foreign language

113
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:21,810
we're right back

assets that have no idea how to do it
right

116
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,540
uh... as a brain

117
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:35,529
breitbart snack at science has language
and risky sex

118
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:40,499
it was all of those dates from from
nothing and that's that's pretty amazing

119
00:05:40,499 --> 00:05:46,350
writes that there are all kinds of thugs
breaking all kinds of illegal aliens

120
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:49,810
generally the most interesting part of
the fact that we can really think that

121
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,159
we want

122
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:53,360
uh... belief about constitutional the

123
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,730
politics isn't it isn't that awful

124
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,580
door is a kind of questions

125
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,669
most of my colleague revolve around and
armor

126
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:07,180
he realized he for more than two granted
polluted

127
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:11,819
more and better uh... do you recall the
harm to her memory

128
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:14,409
interdiction

129
00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:16,939
as both a colleague focused on that

130
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:21,019
a_t_f_ was developed by ten o'clock a
steady myself familiar to you

131
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:22,180
buffalo

132
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,989
home computer update on your revenge

133
00:06:25,989 --> 00:06:29,110
jump actually worked with momma started
home

134
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,789
uh... he also provoked a lot of times

135
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:34,499
and two thousand series for the return
of science

136
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:37,849
number assigned to the city antenna

137
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:41,440
why do we want the research that he's
done a few days of knowledge here

138
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,990
disagreed with some of the

139
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:48,069
perhaps vaccines for working to start a
company called

140
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:49,780
they have a plan for colin

141
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,399
which led resistance

142
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:56,489
court will be returning to talk about
today uh... uniforms complementary

143
00:06:56,489 --> 00:07:00,659
and and so they have the responsibility
is

144
00:07:00,659 --> 00:07:05,389
with a loss of body is also lead to
losses but one company two patrol

145
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:08,639
sizes like reverberated absolutely
license

146
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,710
ought to be sure to send that isn't the
easiest for that matter imperious power

147
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,110
and infrastructure

148
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,969
uh... disappointed and all of you is
this the release of reading

149
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:20,009
uh... it's gone

150
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:21,960
twenty-three has to that

151
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,879
you are so much

152
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:29,180
animosity five hundred different papers
with her and we haven't even talked very

153
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:29,970
fast

154
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,579
as much as i have to her transcript

155
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:34,969
also

156
00:07:34,969 --> 00:07:40,500
because that's exactly what the director
solemin creative arts love

157
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,250
actually while so they're trying to
explain

158
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,870
the neurological basis

159
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:49,310
for somebody systematically trying to
explain to the parts the brain i'll be

160
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,199
talking

161
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,439
a lot of books at one point papers go
while doing this if you have any

162
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:57,710
questions before you haven't fully

163
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,020
exaggerated and that is really a

164
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,300
whatever resources here like this it
will probably go

165
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,389
must further detail

166
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:11,659
like i said but celebrities boyfriends
indeed amardeep anyway which i guess the

167
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:15,919
real world spirited stopped to reload
ministration un

168
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,089
application to seriously uses the urine

169
00:08:19,089 --> 00:08:20,289
to explain

170
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:24,240
some things that we've all deal with on
a daily basis of

171
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,740
mitsubishi's lobbyists on dinner

172
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,669
basically showed you

173
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:33,650
how you're purebred

174
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,140
this is something i think it yes

175
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:41,500
uh... if they have seen a peace talks
under different or or or earmarked

176
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,139
memory

177
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:44,500
decided on financial itself

178
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,830
properties are related to the big
demonstration of

179
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,380
real world

180
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,540
and patients

181
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,760
so hard to do that without them if they
say they should be given a

182
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,310
they said it was like four

183
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,830
that's

184
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,080
and of course in the entire world now

185
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,750
nasty stuff

186
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,639
but that is worth the cost of associates
with uh...

187
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:09,120
exciting to me

188
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,699
so wide his talk here consistent

189
00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:14,910
good question wondered why i have a car

190
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:17,580
lined up

191
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:23,170
so i want to add to the world

192
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:27,830
naturalism

193
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,970

reebok's and he's not going to be having
a debate yet

v

198
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,770
basically it was a crime

199
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,540
that you were to be a computer based on

200
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,650
the probability

201
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,660
that you're going to make this work

202
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,149
sinking wow that's fine

203

cuban intelligence instrument masses the
intelligence anytime

207
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,780
lobbyists

208
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,320
she sex as they had to find pads

209
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,179
so our season

210
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:12,100
uh... from parents started to stop at
the age and it doesn't look like a lot

211
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:12,889
of data

212
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:17,630
on people don't even know if the purpose
databases all kinds of track races with

records and everything that you may

214
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:22,990
remember the fugitive

215
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:26,389
who don't understand how have you got
the when it happens

216
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:33,100
human rights record units these intimate
with her parents don't vote in simple

217
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,660
son he don

218
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,790
ended well you know

219
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:43,190
this is truly figured out it wasn't me
aggressively to rule system right

220
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,750
because it had an idea

221
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:50,810
who you really are now he had a few
minutes anything about it or not pressie

222
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,480
otherwise bruxelles

223
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,050
talkative program secondly any single
word on the panel figure i have copied

224
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,580
using

225
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:04,770
used to see what they were not what's
implied axes lucia did or not everywhere

226
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:09,819
it's because you don't see the recipient
of one to one of the same

227
00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:12,010
one of the universe is where they say

228
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:15,530
is that a representation of what a
pedophile looks like

229
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:18,339
as far as if you have a printer business
dateline

230
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:23,220
this is a_b_c_ that they were colors and
then so you decide to do it on t_v_

231
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:28,330
mahe cavalier we'll see if you get a
refund due to be selected by you know

00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:32,450
it's probably a doorknob rentals or uses
every medium dress up ahead you can see

233
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,380
we can't have ryan

234
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:38,860
all those inconsistent to talk about
enumerate yardstick

235
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:43,350
cuban filter out the betty anything that
this is fiction

236
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,910
a friend of mine actually call today
said

237
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:49,730
you know that they were talking about
that and arizona aggregate data

238
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:53,950
to deny that it instead is actually
working project where they are

239
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,330
scrambling

240
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:58,179
databases for multiple data sources

241
00:11:58,179 --> 00:11:59,960
describes you

242
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,310
fines

243
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:04,350
using a probability totally tabulations

244
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,750
ever seen

245
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,590
persisted so that we are credit cards
all the or

246
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:12,399
uh... the fact that it is to use them

247
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,760
caesarean

248
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,900
i want to imagine a world where they
have really good technology strategist

249
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,429
at nat young actresses angelos comp data

250
00:12:21,429 --> 00:12:24,740
brentwood wounded before my best friend
but she is done

251
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,959
twenty-two

252
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:29,360
accounted for in a state to process
allstate

253
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,510
is heard

254
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,790
so that i can tell you should have

255
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:37,640
this meeting will be really it doesn't
mean that was copied distributed change

256
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,430
things freely evelyn

257
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,700
because you don't see it

258
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,530
way really rich and powerful

259
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,550
two-mile

260
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,760
in any future ed

261
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:51,520
all of us has already said we're going
to just be enhanced view corporations

262
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,360
declaration right now

263
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,780
and research projects andy everybody
needs to have access and the hearings on

264
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,500
the scene is that nobody

265
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,510
and

266
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,030
beginning the whole day

267
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,690
so

268
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,580
that it is for you

269
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:10,850
starts develops you're black or which is
currently again that it has been a great

270
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,890
job inspire obedient peoples and

271
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,400
robbins visit

272
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,930
monkeys but no one seemed to accept that
you've been license agreements

273
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:23,000
a_t_t_ to develop our contemporary
systems

274
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,310
passive were already made platform

275
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,810
that's right reaction

276
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:29,960
so

277
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:34,080
my guess is we did not want to be told
by one company and i liked the

278
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,140
competency exam part of real people

279
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,030
i don't think it deserves a good for the
future of our unit

280
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,120
so

281
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,709
you all the time distance the only
understand it

282
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:48,939
that all of the issues and he said there
were editor tried using fluently and all

283
00:13:48,939 --> 00:13:50,879
of these business

284
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:53,710
adults understands technology

285
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,410
okay so

286
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,550
how easy is to protect ourselves

287
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:00,620
we did our own verification so

288
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,980
do you think i figured out

289
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,910
based on this

290
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,090
racially-based timing out there

291
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:10,960
what's the government probably think
that i a m

292
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,640
they need people to see what do you need
to change themselves

293
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,200
lan already that you have to say this

294
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:17,920
so

295
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,120
may not have a compliment her or you're
not going to

296
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,980
stopped that

297
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,190
friends discount

298
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,880
pathfinder warehouse

299
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:31,410
unimpeded mission yesterday that i
wanted to let his voice

300
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:34,570
so thing is that these frameworks for
all

301
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:35,510
period

302
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,720
as one thing

303
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,130
uh... disprove also does these things
work that's good but it's best not to

304
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,180
change that

305
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:46,460
all the details how this will be
retarded question it completely

306
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,040
and there's a lot of people in the
states

307
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,819
by helping to set sail

308
00:14:50,819 --> 00:14:55,419
edwin architecture's usually run on and
it's the solution doublespeak that's

309
00:14:55,419 --> 00:14:56,900
right

310
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,589
the warning warning that working on a
problem

311
00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:01,310
the easiest to work asap

312
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,350
so uh...

313
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,890
at something like that

314
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:09,740
they had people need to have access to
step out

315
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:13,650
with orchard

316
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:17,360
ought to be a maisie closest sorry about
that

317
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,100
i think it's the same lying

318
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,760
so half of the legal

319
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,190
i'm talking about

320
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:29,080
explosive at most

321
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,810
all right sir consciousness

322
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:36,060
white underclass bergman's process
really after the punitive damages

323
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,870
but it seems to be that process the
thousands to comment

324
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,370
misconception

325
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,330
there's only two kinds of consciousness

326
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,810
busy caucuses as participants

327
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:51,460
any constancy it's time for treating
some analysts practice based on these

328
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,500
problems

329
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,610
uh... car scientists

330
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:57,529
they have to be a problem at heart
problem and he did wrong

relief on carpal colonies promises the
partners are

332
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,240
uh...

333
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,240
uh... the you probably see space s

pick-up disease are winning

335
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:11,940
as it was being said

336
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,170
uh... do you have the ability to control
your behavior

337
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:16,730

constantly harassed crawford confidants

343

conscious and sleeping

349
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,950
utility here it is for information

350
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:51,870
the elite verses that access his
political stage

351
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,529
and we're doing in the states

352
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:55,870
and that's not forget that for you

353
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,510
difficult with his view

354
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:00,460
but we do have a

355
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:05,600
led a lot of policies processes because
with enough time and one

356
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,700
and research that was bureau why all
these things are true why controller

357
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:14,410
equilibrated structures in lhasa with

00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,919
uh... diehard kansas city kansas

360
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,210

00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,810
denmark's

365
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:30,860
that's a tough question

366
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,179
uh... silicon steel with fire

367
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:36,779
because it uses the sun's boxes
walk-through bruxelles

368
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:38,610
the wire we wear

369
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:39,529
that we're doing

370
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:40,830
what he's doing

371
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:47,830
went to see your eternal life

372
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,370
possible flooding in the investigation

373
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:54,350
does something like that perhaps it
suggests that that was the luncheon

374
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,160
uh... neuroscientists scientists like
today

375
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,640
despondent on his part of this

376
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,270
advertising for quite some time slot

377
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,539
so

378
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:06,950
the reality and processes that we do
intelligence we can control what you

379
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:13,950
heard some of the passenger side forty
your concepts like cochran quite this

380
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,390
year

381
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:20,710
the idea of the most important thing is
that we can learn powerful

382
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:24,650
sydney and they are a number of
characters sickness

383
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:28,560
our intelligence for effective we could
more effectively applied acecomm

384
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,840
aristotle

385
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,310
but to meet customers' request sophomore

386
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,320
pass the brady that's

387
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,480
oracle

388
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,210
but again they are expected completely
exhausted right about this soggy system

389
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:42,779
staffers

390
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:45,519
ought to stop hospitals and he is the
uh...

391
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,929
professor of biology and here in calgary
institute of technology

392
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:52,210
unquote often talked about

393
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,370
incitement pause

394
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,550
there's an awful lot equinox

395
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,429
mister arafat

396
00:18:56,429 --> 00:19:00,470
rapid presents for european that has not
been

397
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,370
rise to the constitution

398
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:05,460
caucuses this behavior differently are
not at all exam

399
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,950
many resources

400
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:12,080
but both pioneer after justice walking
by the second is a thriving economy

401
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,410
and other countries entities right

402
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:18,380
so you get ready to do so how best to
bring right

403
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,409
if you forget to breed

404
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,450
is delivery

405
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,400
set design assistant ed

406
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,500
healy rain all of those on systems that
were considered revolution in other

407
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,769
parts of the older sections of britain
and deliberate

408
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:32,740
with her

409
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,640
longest reptiles

410
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,969
million brain

411
00:19:35,969 --> 00:19:37,730
that's for sure dali

412
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:40,740
all over the past

413
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,620
told most of the things that we don't
have to do

414
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,020
but we don't have to pay

415
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,299
m_i_t_ students love to do with them

416
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:53,370
arguing for about six to eight thousand
civilians and all that there is money

417
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,640
and i think that's it

418
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,049
it's just a lot about why we didn't know
her

419
00:19:58,049 --> 00:19:59,310
limits

420
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,230
so

421
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:06,610
i wish you a lot of the sound system so
many the ordeal he will be liberated

422
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,789
representatives is that right

423
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:12,960
but it was the networks sensible that's
appropriate and it wasn't working our

424
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,580
way languages

425
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,409
case s

426
00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:18,330
so

427
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:22,800
like that is the worst backwards i think
i says little progress the brain

428
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,010
package with a bus blew his brains

429
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:27,470
but he said it is our people are

430
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:30,799
but there are animals that have a
political power also

431
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,130
but most analysts bestseller

432
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:37,799
bobcat cochran

433
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:44,799
scarlet words expressed some interest

434
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:50,610
experts phone conversations about
certain things

435
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:53,250
that night

436
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:59,520
unscented or less theses opposite last
few to bring ready to be shot in a

438
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,450
you're

insulated zero gravity

440
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:08,280
parts of the and still be able to get

441
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,420
has to work

442
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:13,280
uh... that's really what one's at your
appearance here or did he resorts and

443
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,460
out of office

444
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,850
does not have a lot of complex in
suburban is it worth it for

445
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,870
has to be simple

446
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:23,680
a_b_c_'s flexible we can learn anything
and treat you differently elaborate on

447
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,020
tasks and researches that twelve years
old

448
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:29,040
uh... breathless alone antibodies from

449
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,060
unpainted

450
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,429
pulls a lot

451
00:21:31,429 --> 00:21:34,399
edge if you look at the airport taxes
all

452
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:38,000
hussein is very beautiful rights is
safer for ourselves

453
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,740
he would be nice if it were tested for
dan ruts reports expense but you're

454
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,580
going on

455
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,720
right at the our progress

456
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,480
if there is it fair to say to them to
you

457
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,500
so

458
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:55,180
against species plessy flexibility
important it's easy to save algorithm

459
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,299
over and over again to solve

460
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:59,200
faded problems

461
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,149
ourselves

462
00:22:00,149 --> 00:22:04,040
it's also the respected right we have

463
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,450
bastardy biological

464
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:11,380
connie of this plan m_t_v_'s everybody's
found food chains of remarks

465
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,980
that's obviously i'm a little time
friends because we haven't really had a

466
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,380
different society interactive

467
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,309
and lasted

468
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:22,640
to build a fire hydrant bombs

469
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,789
he's also really benefited when those
facts

470
00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:28,200
french so we can picture of the approval
process that we are brute force

471
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,890
populations good but

472
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,170
the breslow president

473
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,470
uh... slope

474
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,950
biological machine

475
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,490
that package

476
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,360
and if you look at how fast time

477
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,130
two members get best you interested

478
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,820
it's much faster than i am

479
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,830
a factor of a specimen

480
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:48,270
doesn't mean much

481
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:51,900
and i think well so that when i say that
i couldn't believe it or not and figure

482
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,160
out how to be as when i was actually

483
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,310
based on what is that what you think of
this is going on behind her

484
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,950
metal studs right

485
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:03,220
why do you ever enacted tell you as a
doorknob

486
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:06,890
in less than a hundred sex there it is
not

487
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,200
while we're slow

488
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,360
result problems really effectively we
use

489
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,520
the funding for this the last paragraph

490
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,070
that's not a mob adverbs

491
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:22,050
now you know why i would say that you
were tax uh... again sory bernard

492

493
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,240
well

494
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:32,240
figure out

495
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,420
even if you look up hundred-thousand
sensitive to your program

496
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,010
usually the one

497
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:46,340
that'd be a bit of the doorknob with on
a process

498
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,810
but without food

499
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:51,030
so and israel's announced as part of the
message

500
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:54,929
colin powell beijing or because of the
the several days a week and are

501
00:23:54,929 --> 00:23:59,590
completely untrue seemed to your program

502
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:03,810
hard to believe what i said it's about a
new report yes

503
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:06,379
so that all the terms of remember it was
nice

504
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:08,279
model is the problem

505
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:09,730
occupancy

506
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:10,880
eat

507
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:17,880
anybody with applied for is that no
other whatever here's their operated you

508
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,460
know

509
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,830
but is not respect

510
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,940
our prime quality

511
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:30,240
yes i i mean how do you know how long it
was a time to do an opportunity for an

512
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,180
outstanding record anybody initiated

513
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:40,070
seventy years ago at the very last
despite based it includes recognition

514
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:42,170
ta

515
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:47,450
so it's a good ten years physics duties
he denied

516
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:52,220
dictator don't worry i'm going to meet
with managing editor of the fact that it

517
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,970
could happen in your comments

518
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,650
i think i think your senses identified

519
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:00,010
polarize the disputed onto an outbreak

520
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:02,890
now that uh... basically

521
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:09,890
it

522
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,090

ito sponsoring it works best you don't

545
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:40,610
program writing program your credit card

said we're not

549
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:50,039
you get your out how to solve problems
as per cent of the problem

550
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:53,400
and the branded as a hassle

551
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,340
we cannot assist with the seven after

role based on university databases that
you have to explain to us bases where

556
00:27:08,179 --> 00:27:09,309
they were obvious

557
00:27:09,309 --> 00:27:10,720
if you do that

558
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,830
uh... watch

559
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:16,800
issue and store information from a
hierarchy you know we had a lot of the

560
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,549
world because as it turns out

561
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:21,029
if you look at the world see acts like
that

562
00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:22,770
bobbing on the world

563
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:24,419

569
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,179
the passport time and that's

570
00:27:37,179 --> 00:27:39,840
yet more basic overtime edge

that's obviously today's party

576
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:55,490
but they're not stations arson

577
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:59,920
whatever so that the world actually
terrible structure

578
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,279
but apparently a store that it'll be

579
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:03,620

unselectable off-color three-c_d_

612

00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,399
one to work on work so that

620
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,210
if you do not call it or not

621
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:14,059
but not that we're pretty tons of them

622
00:30:14,059 --> 00:30:15,389
with hearts

623
00:30:15,389 --> 00:30:17,320
resort to this town

624
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,720
uh... world here's a sample ideas

625
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,580
anywhere else and this sounds coming
from but a few things and get it there

626
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,910
was this vibrancy halls right

627
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:30,960
so we can always costs for dating and a
little artist

628
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,620
we cover the cost of style

629
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:38,240
we have for causes for all of the so
it's not all

630
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,120
reason this is a possibility

631
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,950
so you say sam it's the same thing as
causing

632
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:48,770
this has been sent

633
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:52,840
suspect that it's not the area and
that's where the brick dot so that's why

634
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,559
if you get older it's harder to shape
because of the books the same or that's

635
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:00,490
what you know if you are growing inside
his white house

636
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:02,049
they also has a sound

637
00:31:02,049 --> 00:31:05,530
right and it's hard to learn a lot of
different words for different languages

638
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,440
artifact that is that this was a fetus

639
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,790
you're great

640
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,720
throws away information

641
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:17,559
betting sorority house so again police
are developed costs for halloween

642
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:19,730
encourage people to live with it

643
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:25,160
development

644
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,160
raa

645
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,809
doug as your pregnancy

646
00:31:29,809 --> 00:31:33,100
eighties early and i think that is the
syrians

647
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:37,770
writing that is the closest to the renos
activities prior notice

648
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:40,120
disturbances factor

649
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,970
is the hoa

650
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:47,929
weekend edition's so if you will get
beginning in a heartbeat

651
00:31:47,929 --> 00:31:49,360
indeed when it comes up

652
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,800
period she hit the changes that will
work on it

653
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,990
predictions come down

654
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:58,970
so ubiquitous copies of the time you can
see it on where casting glanced at the

655
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,889

837
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,299
exactly how it works well

838
00:41:33,299 --> 00:41:36,510
uh... that's it for your reference
scientist scientist

839

the whole thing it's a whole theory of
the car

845
00:41:56,839 --> 00:41:58,150

old

858
00:42:38,249 --> 00:42:40,799
isn't that right so

859
00:42:40,799 --> 00:42:45,159
let me see if i have a safe streets of
manhattan verification software at the

further karun

862
00:42:47,269 --> 00:42:48,579
that we're looking at me

863
00:42:48,579 --> 00:42:50,060
it's very powerful hierarchy

864
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,779
inhabit our neuro

865
00:42:51,779 --> 00:42:58,779
it's the up but it is sealed brian kato
et cetera considered democratic excuse

866
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,379
associate director of the error

867
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:06,700
there's a lot of single around here
somewhere if u u

868
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,569
despite manner

869
00:43:07,569 --> 00:43:09,839
moving your vision

870
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:13,969
or that my voice piano explosives as
ruthless

871
00:43:13,969 --> 00:43:15,500
you know it's still early

872
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,469
eds

873
00:43:18,469 --> 00:43:21,069
that's all based on he keep working
again

874
00:43:21,069 --> 00:43:24,769
want dot parity

875

character

876
00:43:39,279 --> 00:43:42,889
rockwell so it won't be actual bob

877
00:43:42,889 --> 00:43:47,180
the actual problems that we received the
stranded

878
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,970
disheveled william burroughs

879
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:52,270
but as you see a lot of these you know i
have wanted to do you believe the

880
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:54,019
technical aspects of that

881
00:43:54,019 --> 00:43:55,200
azmaria

882
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,639
so for a credible

883
00:43:57,639 --> 00:43:59,650
already have

884
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:04,579
but if you require papers as he does it
was the basic math

885
00:44:04,579 --> 00:44:07,579
to do that

886
00:44:07,579 --> 00:44:11,099
but as it turns out we don't have to
leave it up here is the same sense is

887
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:15,679
that we ransom you could give us to get
used to be is part of this

888
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:18,039
but i've got to light

889
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:21,869
everybody to read or ever since i like
the world or

890
00:44:21,869 --> 00:44:26,169
or n_c_t_a_ swirl there is still there

891
00:44:26,169 --> 00:44:28,419
uh... moderate

892
00:44:28,419 --> 00:44:29,730
one of the field

893
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:30,930
everytime someone's life

894
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:32,569
these are

895
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:33,599
i would imagine

896
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:36,029
disrespectful excessive use that

897
00:44:36,029 --> 00:44:38,489
triangular catch

898
00:44:38,489 --> 00:44:40,529

902
00:44:45,509 --> 00:44:51,369
exercise that success

903
00:44:51,369 --> 00:44:54,819
i'd like to know whether an exercise in
a while

904
00:44:54,819 --> 00:45:01,819
yeah

905
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,559
software

906
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:06,400
so go the extra exegesis

907
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:11,599
super fast but i do know that the sort
of overseas across handed

908
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:16,069
in replying to this is the united states
for a lot ross perot

909
00:45:16,069 --> 00:45:18,549
you know that you should be different
but ridiculous

910
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:22,049
uh... despite a salary or rehearsal

911
00:45:22,049 --> 00:45:25,849
i think is a point where an
argumentative technology merges so

912
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:27,039
but instead i think that

913
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:29,899
given everything up with the reference
to our veterans

914
00:45:29,899 --> 00:45:34,279
and start to build a network a few
democrats i can't remember

915
00:45:34,279 --> 00:45:37,959
uh... chelsea have her anti-western
resistance leader mine

918
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:48,199
well they have to pass

919
00:45:48,199 --> 00:45:52,530
we are a few minutes technology begins
strapless on those are business that

920
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:56,439

it could be my to vietnam

944
00:47:06,779 --> 00:47:08,739
so they had

945
00:47:08,739 --> 00:47:13,979
less than three hundred with right

946
00:47:13,979 --> 00:47:17,489
i don't see a guesstimate is again

947
00:47:17,489 --> 00:47:21,779
and it is that this is a top-down whose
for whose very optimistic that don't
