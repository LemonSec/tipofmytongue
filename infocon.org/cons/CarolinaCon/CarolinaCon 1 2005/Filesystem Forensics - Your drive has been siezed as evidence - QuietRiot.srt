but i heard something in a spirit

77
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:32,029
and so we said something

78
00:03:32,029 --> 00:03:34,229
really see that happen

79
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:36,409

80
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:40,099

or why they're worried that you are

89
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:09,119

also where it said that it is that the

118
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:41,409
like that you have to see the important
thing is that still

119
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,639
well that's when the investigator its

120

294
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:00,240
armchair altogether the premise artur

295
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,530
they're gonna have to

296
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:04,230

297
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,170
some places approve it

298
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,840
the driver ltd

299
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,390
so they hit

300
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,470
changes

301
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,769
that made me does it

302
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:14,290
u_s_ estimate

303
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,530
so that we didn't

304
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:19,450
in court determined whether or not this
guy was just where they did not

305
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,260
there's a link to view

306
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,990
we know that goes into people that could
have

307
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:30,210
teamster planted local revenues

308
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,560
what did you get this in

309
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:36,570
what they're going to lose their this is
a bit

310
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,610
just inside

311
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:39,790
rick lockridge

312
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:44,470
there's also opening for eighty eight's
does the substitute

313
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:47,410
but it's a part of what is the answer to
me

314
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,420
physical fitness

315
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,670
in the computer the accompaniment

316
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,770
laws

317
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:57,350
notoriously need to drive

318
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,470
superdrive

319
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:03,220
this up we can be solved just basically
to write to the drive to get this

320
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,700
turbulence on

321
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,080

00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,130
moving

344
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:28,990
it's true

345
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,830
tired right

346
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,410
like it doesn't get

347
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,620
uh... do it

348
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,350
this is a member reasonable

349
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,470
d_d_t_ where you basically plays the
invite which is

350
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,990
yes the eighties

351
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:40,800
inspired

352
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,159
first yes

353
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,970
okay this market is here nowhere is
insane

354
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:47,410
with basically means

355
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:50,120
the dr decides it

356
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,170
they all the way because of the deadlock
or something

357
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,840
what do you normally do

358
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,000
the awful

359
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,380
in your data invite on the stand

360
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,340
units will be shorter

361
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,970
the actual dates and voters right zeros

362
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:09,600
can be a problem

363
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,550
that's right

364
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,490
when i worked at all

365
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,390
really at all

366
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,750
i'll prob that's what

367
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,669
you go

368
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:18,990
ability once the s_d_p_ didi rescue

369
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:22,390
cancellations on this article that you
know there's a lot better

370
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,460
they will

371
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,650
continue on that

372
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,669
and probably put sears

373
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:28,900
there but they don't

374
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,650
image problems out

375
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:31,659
so the accident

376
00:18:31,659 --> 00:18:34,400
the network for tonight

377
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,510
network is going to try it

378
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,120
copy onto

379
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,240
use a machine because soon as you copy
data

380
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,580
consultancy senior fashion and she

381
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,760
and your president

382
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:53,450
i see you don't want to read to the same
dispute your website suggested

383
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:54,700
drying up

384
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,039
recovers india

385
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,460
it was one of went on to another device
because

386
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:03,240
putting out the same destinataire
currently possibly rhetorical sectors

387
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,520
that you tried to recover

388
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,860
this this networking basically just
adjacent to middle class

389
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,510
and and i'd be putting him back yet

390
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:21,510
untrustworthy situation received the on
who brought him back and listener

391
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,330
and sees it

392
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,210
forever

393
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:25,679
and that's the issue

394
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,920
a file

395
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:34,100
consulate

396
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,620
i'll continue this

397
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,630
start you cannot use fuel storage unit

398
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,420
test and the city is the requirement
that

399
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,480
now we want to do

400
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,760
want to generate eighty

401
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,370
you can pick out a bit

402
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,240
they probably is the same

403
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,299
as the one

404
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:52,670
digestion

405
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:58,160
and also in the else's dont you get a
check

406
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,050
uh... asks

407
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:00,889
matches

408
00:20:00,889 --> 00:20:02,210
we've been working

409
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,480
all along and want to catch it

410
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,340
doesn't match basically says no way to
prove

411
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,960
there's no way to say that

412
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,300
you didn't ask uh... it displays

413
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:19,300
where the oppressed

414
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,530
i'm not sure i had no idea why i said
you wanted weaknesses for up to the

415
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:29,680
front desk is his main tasks i can't

416
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,570
yes

417
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:34,000
cure no i don't think i've got a little
bit

418
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,980
the results a murder or we all different
so

419
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:45,980
do you want to

420
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:55,660
let's have a blessed tools and losing

421
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,950
this one called a arens tuesday

422
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:02,180
peacefully dot

423
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:05,000
interface to t_v_ already

424
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,950
d_c_ healthy eating

425
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:11,560
renoir results are us

426
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,590
arm

427
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,160
is basically just a

428
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,280
interfaces

429
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,600
to hold the spot bfl

430
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,230
dei

431
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:29,640
delegated

432
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:36,640
educated

433
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,950
so this is what it comes from

434
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:44,350
commercial package i think you can
download of the injured

435
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:47,830
i believe history

436
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:51,670
forensics

437
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:53,460
is believed that there would be great

438
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,480
pre-existing

439
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,650
as you can either image of this but
there are a lot

440
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,050
orange

441
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,900
or you can just take the conference

442
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,380
but say for example

443
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,570
betrayed him trying to are seen here

444
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,870
um... had already worked for an hour

445
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,160
eurostar slept

446
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,130
drive four dat

447
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,600
if you decide where to put it

448
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,040
there's probably process here for the
title

449
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,510
through our success story predict how
are you

450
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,460
smart

451
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,870
a

452
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:36,590
in the e_e_c_ irwin

453
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:40,590
cases it is

454
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,100
at this price tomorrow

455
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:46,280
that i think it'll be some on the
information along the

456
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,580
so up analyze trends are kept

457
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,800
haitians eva

458
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,730
uh... office which is now resolved

459
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,010
commission about the specific case

460
00:22:55,010 --> 00:23:02,010
so i'm just gonna

461
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,159
well i think you can break this up

462
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,090
into uh... different sized up

463
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,500
so that we gave them

464
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,330
affordably

465
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:13,360
please to put a new

466
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,520
but how can i ask is actually

467
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,130
johal asahi

468
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:21,050
by taking no chances in person

469
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:28,050
envelope blocks

470
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,500
business disclosed it

471
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:43,500
inscribed in mind this now

472
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,490
presentation

473
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:52,730
which mister nelson

474
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:55,070
because it takes a little bit of time to

475
00:23:55,070 --> 00:24:02,070
pick ups understanding on

476
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:09,520
exhortation

477
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:19,780
so that's the in asia

478
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:30,910
confused by it

479
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:36,320
yes and cases

480
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:43,320
gold standard i guess

481
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:13,900
the uh... the margin

482
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:20,900
gently take

483
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:33,030
dot

484
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,080
outside

485
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:58,080
fall

486
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:08,510
yes

487
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,440
file types spying

488
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,559
insuring

489
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,990
extended

490
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:20,330
any scrap

491
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,750
where you can

492
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,610
on route

493
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:28,720
different sections

494
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,280
outside c

495
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,940
how did u

496
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:36,720
intentionally

497
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,320
textile its distance

498
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:47,390
says the lord

499
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:52,409
so uh... what has failed duty and his
father usb drive

500
00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:53,890
on my car

501
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:56,460
is when you start feasting

502
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:00,270
is that the g_o_p_ should be easily ask
you to know what he wanted the case

503
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:03,300
because there seems to me here

504
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,260
organization

505
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,890
figure things out

506
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:10,880
we may be working on a couple projects
at once

507
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,880
separate out things get this case

508
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,460
can't use what you want

509
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,880
described here

510
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,539
and then you can choose a number of
different processes

511
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:22,890
for i'd guess passes

512
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:26,659
you can't help but i don't have that
pile debts unknown via filter which

513
00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:29,899
um...

514
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:34,100
basically you can get a database of

515
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,580
breast feeds for possible but they're
not on the upside

516
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:40,590
probably not be a big deal

517
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:43,370
burroughs wellcome investigations he can
say

518
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:50,370
imax camera don't worry about cares to
someone who's the elmo

519
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:58,580
along and screen test for next time he's
basically just different options

520
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,210
frank desiccation

521
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,309
just and update

522
00:28:01,309 --> 00:28:02,730
ta kar

523
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:06,870
is what

524
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,020
pullout

525
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,210

00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:11,570
hardball system

527
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:12,370
so see you

528
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:15,480
dependent on their on your direct

529
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,870
williamson's

530
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:21,800
well he comes up all systems index in
the game doesn't matter to people

531
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,720
but also in those days would still be on
platter

532
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,289
you just got deleted

533
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:31,120
or hurting a non-event table or to write
to us that we're going

534
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,240
well indeed the very least

535
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,300
atop of data in this looks like an
animal behavior

536
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,850
so if i can find that's information and
one player

537
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,090
give me the public data between that

538
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,250
and most likely however

539
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,560
in two thousand into it

540
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,090
our people's exhibit

541
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:51,760
alike in car out that counts

542
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,929
and can you step i'll select that's the
date at the end

543
00:28:54,929 --> 00:28:56,880
possible leads

544
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,490

545
00:28:58,490 --> 00:28:59,820

552
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,990
you can store data and

553
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,510
in your file system

554
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:20,690

tools to get to that slacks

558
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,100
it's left the phoenix
