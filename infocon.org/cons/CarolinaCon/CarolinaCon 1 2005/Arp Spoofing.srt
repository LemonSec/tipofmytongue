non-factor said once more

111
00:05:56,969 --> 00:05:58,479
put it back so

sorry to have some pays what will i be
addressed so it's it's a flat scale

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,789
which will flap

116
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:14,119

tiwari attitudes

170
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,080

00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:01,990
closest to him

175
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,709
the worry gateway

176
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,250

181
00:09:14,669 --> 00:09:16,910
said you don't mind management

182
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:20,310
so now there are countries now update

183
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,020
young innocent information back to close
down

184
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,710
someone's

185
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,130
all information communicated i'm for it

186
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:32,730
and that he's going to be didn't happen

187
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,560
someone always on the phone call

188
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,030
well there's a lot of the keisha
whistler

189
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,829
and back but i mean is

190
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,959
i pretend to be whomever a wannabe

191
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:44,260
you're listening to you you might be

192
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,069
you wouldn't necessarily know it'll be
controls

193
00:09:47,069 --> 00:09:48,880
they were talking to each other

194
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,100
so it device they went on to my speedy
just to

195
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,550
business for us was already going to be
talking to them

196
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,019
soaking attacker

197
00:09:58,019 --> 00:09:59,130
in monster

198
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,680
interstellar or regulate traffic

199
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,850
within the protocol

200
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,860
you know our pittsburgh for a living
alone in the middle

201
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,720
uh... attack

202
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,470
basically set in battle between track so

203
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:16,230
birthday baby yet

204
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,190
house somewhere between

205
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,620
porschesite

206
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,700
on the router

207
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,400
or under ten million dollar allison

208
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,140
even between b_-two reverential rather
answered any amendment

209
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,400
also don't think they're talking to one
another actually built on a million

210
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,540
times for the information on

211
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,690
so i think that was just a little which
is

212
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:38,080
sort of you know

213
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,620
you'd months apart

214
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:44,770
yeah targeted yourself meetings until
after they had to be passwords are

215
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,650
but just make it to you

216
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,860
and also we're going to happen

217
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,660
you deal with us

218
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,830
i've been

219
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:58,090
syndrome somewhere else

220
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,040
that's not amendable attacking

221
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,910
scenarios

222
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,200
so my schooling is pretend to be seen by
a not so that's where the hopes to

223
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,490
convince them

224
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,410
they also call it or poisoning net
cuisines of the public and the actual

225
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,720
cash

226
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,940
store within the blacks in size of a
policeman cashman's ok out in anyway

227
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,010
you're

228
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,250
you're going to have you dressed tables

229
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,579
and haha mutilated incest

230
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:23,620
and wasn't comes in

231
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:26,329
and another problem with the are
protocols will do that

232
00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:28,340
insiders in our blah

233
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,370
in out there working with him request

234
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:35,580
so i would ask endanger the protocols
but also

235
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:40,100
artists problem he lands weber and also
not copying of a problem

236
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,200
now hounded by staying around my speed
and has no obligation

237
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,370
and i just what it is for informational
only

238
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:51,360
protocol and use that saddam and we're
not the intended

239
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,140
so there's no

240
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,370
no indication he's for taking the movie
is the best

241
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:59,170
as terrible news coming in

242
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,690
gave him hoping to do

243
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:05,440

corporate always great

427
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,150
and basically was built upon a trusted
network

428

abrupt also

431
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,450
after working about

432
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:30,660
and i accept that the computers and i
think part of a very very expert you

433
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,300
tell me

434
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,090

436
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:40,870
there's a lot of these issues for us and
it worked

437
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:41,659
and even

438
00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:45,070
organization still today in-house
organizations

439
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:48,080
known don't do much in regards as far as

440
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,750
unilateral and trying to

441
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,210
the biggest your recall

442
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:54,720
your mission bay

443
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,770
you know get to see how you guys on the
network began immediately with the u_s_

444
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,010
charset in traffic and

445
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:04,410
units and

446
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,480
i have said it was based on

447
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,200
uh... trusted mobster

448
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,730
doesn't lessons learned long talk about
this

449
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:17,360
is don't trust anyone network that you
don't control

450
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,739
special your hotel

451

as number one which i just got off

452
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,770
which would be learned

453
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:27,110
and i think it would be something
contractor gobbling networks uh...

454
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:30,230
hobby shop hot spot

455
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,460
