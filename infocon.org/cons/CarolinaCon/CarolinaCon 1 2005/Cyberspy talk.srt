his chronology of the breeding in fact
microcosm

37
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,119
how we started wearing was in the

all this is really important things

43
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,310
also today

44
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,710
hal

45
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,519
even beyond the immediate

46
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:11,089
poverty acker

47
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,189
with that

48
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:15,199
uh... tricky isn't that good or not

49
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:17,379
uh... deepaksingh server

50
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:18,499

panties

54
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:26,079
what was the only way to end the day

55
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:29,809
what was a late bloomer cyber crimes and
they could we trust me

56
00:02:29,809 --> 00:02:31,309
here we go through

57
00:02:31,309 --> 00:02:36,199
poverty but probably we will have longer
more active

58
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:39,719
and i said that everyone excellent at
the older ones for her

59
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:42,900
confidential teams around

60
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,319
so this is an escape

61
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,219
santiago around

62
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:46,870
cooperative

63
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,439
cadet org

64
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:50,260
they had to write a panel discussion

65
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,570
so many questions of anybody or anything
in particular

66
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,509
any questions of how things work out but
we asked me

67
00:02:56,509 --> 00:03:00,939
over me

68
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:02,949
i guess at what this also makes

69
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:07,129
only get a sense of atmosphere behind
the scenes what was going on we got it

70
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:08,809
what was it like before

71
00:03:08,809 --> 00:03:11,150
uh... broad-band cable uh...

72
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,080
d_s_l_

73
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,569
we've met a one hundred ten books music
mode

74
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:17,279
remembering those

75
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:21,769
we've got to go home and i have
something like

76
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:24,870
political dot corner

77
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,129
in that presumably owner has out there

78
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:29,779
electorate

79
00:03:29,779 --> 00:03:31,970
because so what's happening right now

80
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:36,090
things that went on t_v_ since the late
seventies and early nineties should

81
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,070
always have rebuilt brave new world out
there

82
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:43,979
especially on the album we're talking
about of globalization

83
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:48,689
a pool economy up a little now there's a
lot more we can do it now

84
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:50,659
with one of the evil or harm

85
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:51,859
that we could

86
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:56,319
that nearly four hundred ten thousand
people online

87
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,339
straightforward

88
00:03:58,339 --> 00:03:59,900
basically ruined stars

89
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,910
sixteen forty two bloody pastel
developed a mechanism called up asking

90
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,259
exactly the figures

91
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:07,559
carranza pens

92
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:09,999
hundreds of thousands

93
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:13,490
innocuous i think the contributions to
any other videos

94
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,740
was going to various things one of the
operating language

95
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,269
called estelle

96
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:22,389
as a picture of the original she had to
go

97
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:27,139
seventeen ninety one trial balance cosmo
at the bottom of the computing

98
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:31,080
basically using the very first universal
digital computer

99
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,150
with exotic analytical machine which
used

100
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,870
checkered postcards

101
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:40,150
now microsoft really start their first
all over the long run scar

102
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,709
saturday how about the issue from
seventeen ninety one

103
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:45,680
early severance

104
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,810
as a picture of his team

105
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:54,559
jodhpur is at best lived under the
bottom is a picture postcard boom

106
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:57,919
senior so if you don't want to lose by
the industry's long-distance

107
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,120
communication

108
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,780
by saying electric cart

109
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,930
over one mile wide exactly you know what
your baggage

110

boatman graphic design as the title
spent hours with each other

126
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,849
see exactly

127
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:50,300
alexander graham bell got their first
year at the time

128
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,120
but eleven

129
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,860
that he had thomas watson idea

130
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,050
physical review

131
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:01,309
the easel follow i_b_m_ will become the
leader of pc production intervations

132
00:06:01,309 --> 00:06:02,989
nineteen seventeen

133
00:06:02,989 --> 00:06:05,810
who were disturbed me sure do

134
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:06,600
won't work

135
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,110
at one time k

136
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,750
which is considered the most secure
encryption algorithm ever devised

137
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,509
is the only one even today

138
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:15,730
do you recall the perfect purchasing

139

142
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:27,159
intermission is an abstract machine

143
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:30,889
introducing the mathematical precise
definition of algorithm what a terrible

144

procedure

145
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:38,119
but he points out of the first computer
by this time i'm always down

149
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,560
towers is based on what we've done here
to get your analysis for specialty is

150
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,000
all about being behind does have a
picture of the actual

151
