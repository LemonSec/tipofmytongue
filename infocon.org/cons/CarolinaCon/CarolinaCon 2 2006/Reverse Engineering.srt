elisabeth from her doing their bios
business

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:13,139
distributors i've never actually said it
was a laptop atmosphere against that

3
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,980
all right

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,570
lesson in togetherness

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,559
now forcefully

6
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:26,559
post last

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,460
but status

8
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,670
catholic none

9
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,270
also what content correct so

10
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,660
rehearsing gays and even talking about
today alone

11
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,170
it's a one on one side

12
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,810
that particular day six of our young
again to advance the banking and finance

13
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,610
assistance is going to be buried

14
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,060
straightforward about reverse
engineering

15
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,140
amongst the civilian easy way to talk
about reverse engineering its with

16
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,460
soccer cricket

17
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,930
the same stuff that you guys do

18
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,970
made me do

19
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,850
piracy that it's not so

20
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:07,780
i think what i have his bypass around
cds students many people the windows

21
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,549
binaries

22
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:11,390
better very basic

23
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:15,610
register me tight applications um...
their walker a couple does for the end

24
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:19,070
of the story of the devil part

25
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,620
and as such a way to go through the
basics of bread and show you guys are

26
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,130
correct

27
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,489
to israel's fight

28
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:26,150
made the last couple of weeks get
progressively harder

29
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:33,150
we got to figure out mentioned that you
know when you have questions that have

30
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,639
white agenda

31
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:43,420
introduction it'll be about me i'll keep
it brief them before him

32
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,610
uh... x_-eighty six is the basic so are
we talking about thirty-six architecture

33
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,130
and i'm going to be talking about spark
architecture in india

34
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,070
malta despair systems were to be talking
about that

35
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,730
just and i think that's

36
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:59,270
chores on the basic outposts justice
latitude

37
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:03,690
uh... over a little bit about the
affordable still file format

38
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,520
which is the windows xp people
file-format

39
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,660
uh... that will talk about some of the
controls on the other things um... the

40
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,469
other ways to reverse engineer

41
00:02:11,469 --> 00:02:13,539
uh... applications

42
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:18,079
finally will get into the demos of the
actual practice

43
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:20,340
will retrieve your questions

44
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,209
introduction

45
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:26,789
uh... pretty boring stuff i'd belonged
to a couple different parking

46
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:29,290
that i thought that the lead within the
past that i did

47
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,149
currently working as a

48
00:02:31,149 --> 00:02:34,189
information security consultant for a
local company

49
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:38,540
uh... actually moving to charlotte
within your company here in a few weeks

50
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,879
uh... hundred votes on occasion
penetration testing

51
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,120
uh... in other words on

52
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,769
ricethailand bristow

53
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:48,999
my main focus is actually web
applications which i talked about last

54
00:02:48,999 --> 00:02:49,689
year

55
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:54,050
obstacle and that's the only person
probably for about a year now so

56
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:57,419
not an expert in the field by any means
but over about that

57
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:00,290
it looks like that

58
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:04,289
presented major industry conferences
presentable presented uh...

59
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:11,289
the bugs picked up his golf courses
standards

60
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:15,879
exegesis exceed six system basic so what
are the main major components of

61
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:17,299
x_-eighty six has gone

62
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:20,459
polly's laptop computers and wants uh...

63
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,849
they all turned into four major areas

64
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:26,389
through the process of building a memory
high levels in system bus

65
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:28,839
uh... these border areas

66
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:32,049
are going to be cannot reverse
engineering and predominantly be working

67
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:33,689
in the process various

68
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:36,909
which essentially control the operations
the computer executes the data

69
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:38,309
processing form

70
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:42,020
so every time you go to binary into
memory it takes all those those

71
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,799
activities have been some bites

72
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:44,870
putting into memory

73
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,980
and process to bring flows into

74
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,650
into the processor in executes them an
infection execute cycle with a little

75
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,279
bit

76
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:56,389
uh... the main memory is where
everything is historically low dot the

77
00:03:56,389 --> 00:03:58,529
binary is put into the main memory

78
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,099
bastardly vile

79
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:02,779
eyeballs data as well as the program
code

80
00:04:02,779 --> 00:04:06,239
and i will talk a little bit about the
segments that he broke into our latest

81
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,819
line

82
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:09,499
uh... i don't want walls

83
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,409
essentially that's the cramps your
guests uh...

84
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:14,289
non-volatile storage

85
00:04:14,289 --> 00:04:15,689
those types of things

86
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:19,709
uh... it's essentially worded it can be
stored and longer term uh... installed

87
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:22,289
memory it's typically significantly
slower

88
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:24,780
thing about three states

89
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,870
but obviously there is

90
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,119
benefits at least for longer term

91
00:04:28,119 --> 00:04:31,889
uh... and in the system bus trips
communication gap between sandbox

92
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:35,559
tub this is a very high level overview
they have long drawn-out operating

93
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:37,379
system courses that on the detail

94
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:39,569
feedings member in all those types of
things

95
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:42,449
uh... but this is the general high-level
architecture

96
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,879
policies to get used to work

97
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,470
but what if any questions just

98
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,169
burleigh heads up and ask them you know
i don't know it

99
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:54,819
corporate regrouping burglars

100
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:57,150
are some of the processor with a concept

101
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:01,409
processor registers karwa register
essentially is a very small

102
00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:03,500
usually thirty two-bit

103
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,180
public very fast memory

104
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,830
built into the processor

105
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,139
it's faster and smarter many memories

106
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:13,979
there's user fees visible registers our
wish

107
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:17,699
registers that the application can
control in moscow i can put it into

108
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:19,800
campus operations into

109
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,800
arguable point isn't it

110
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,860
and others control status registers
which typically aren't

111
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,540
by the application itself

112
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,620
but are part of the results of safe when
you do any arithmetic operation and

113
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,769
there's an overflow within that
operation

114
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:36,889
it also language in the process for
instance

115
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:38,120
so though that

116
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,990
where everyone a lot of the racers would
be the crack means

117
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:44,169
but that the main thing to remember is
that just thirty two bit of a

118
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:47,009
of memory of blank space that can be
modified

119
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:51,870
pretty applications require

120
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,430
so with the n_c_a_a_ system

121
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,660
axes six system we have eight

122
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,949
general research did you get a raise

123
00:05:57,949 --> 00:05:59,800
obvi xy experience

124
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,370
excess usbnc

125
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,309
the stuff

126
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:05,910
the general purpose registers

127
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:09,809
all have a primary focus above what
they're intended to do

128
00:06:09,809 --> 00:06:10,580
but you can

129
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,229
annotations tobacco use those in
different ways uh... essentially be

130
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:15,399
happy

131
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:17,489
he had to keep later

132
00:06:17,489 --> 00:06:19,350
i was canceled

133
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:23,969
arithmetic operations the results of
your irrigation district

134
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:25,439
palestine registered

135
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:28,059
is primarily used for moving

136
00:06:28,059 --> 00:06:31,009
it when you can get out front for the
person for your call

137
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:35,580
in it probably in the seventies yes
registered

138
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,520
universtiy yes

139
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,430
uh... that's pretty obvious within its
borders restoring data it begins with

140
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,009
the application

141
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:45,610
surveys register is appointed to d_-day
section

142
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,139
of the application

143
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:49,620
your staff when you're disappointed your
stack

144
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,469
within the occasional go through these a
little bit more detail me

145
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:54,080
when we bring a debugger speeding

146
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,720
feudalism before

147
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,839
sources register

148
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,900
at destination register

149
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,360
again after screen-based operations

150
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,900
you'll need to know what their views for
you see the kind of no when we'll bring

151
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,860
something the animation you watched
restrictions with your new data

152
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,809
that's where the data going so register
together just

153
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:15,360
very fast volatile

154
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,769
constantly

155
00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:21,259
gilbert's registers thirty two-bit line

156
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:23,340
uh... called standard registers

157
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,459
the access as as we just saw

158
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:29,689
there's a couple that way it's that you
can address registered ip address

159
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:33,439
register as reasonably accident risk
alternatives

160
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:35,099
you can address it as

161
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:37,539
yes yes yes

162
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:40,339
which is the beer sixteen the
significant this

163
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:43,360
public thirty two-bit registers give
thirty two-bit registrable

164
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,800
would be significant bids

165
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,229
could be the first on the right and you
can view

166
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:49,610
the allocation will reference though

167
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,050
with these smaller

168
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,150
different bob

169
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,590
two months old

170
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:56,279
and you'll see those we'll look at the
assembly the disassembly of our

171
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,359
application

172
00:07:57,359 --> 00:08:01,270
you actually see these paul allen
receiving extended registers fallout

173
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,430
and then you see things like hdl

174
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,620
cscl

175
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,259
which of the high and low ordered this

176
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:09,399
that sixteen bits

177
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:12,399
both a thirty two-bit so you can
reference just eight bits of the

178
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,960
register by using h

179
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,299
anymore cdcl designation

180
00:08:16,299 --> 00:08:17,949
this'll make more sense

181
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:21,550
actually the project

182
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,729
everybody glaucia

183
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:25,490
appropriate at this point

184
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,809
any questions at this point

185
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:32,019
they'd so there's also six sigma dresses
now we're still talking about living in

186
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:36,470
the process is there's six different
centers that you thought of every month

187
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,950
the point sensibilities oleandrin
specific dates of when you fire pure

188
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,750
binary

189
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,540
difference any registers are going to
point to the segments that are specific

190
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:48,020
to your binary integer moving out

191
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,710
uh... to the wineries broken into
different segments such as the data

192
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,310
segment resources segment that
excitement

193
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:58,160
these are important to those different
sections of your primary program

194
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,580
use that same imposing dataset

195
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,070
etcetera

196
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,750
now you've got all that often but within
the people here that we're going to run

197
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,110
you're going to see where references
this excitement

198
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:12,210
plus it was sex sex with an address plus
four points you'll see stuff like that

199
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,770
and that's referencing

200
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:19,420
these basic points

201
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,910
myself other ministers uh...

202
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:25,390
blood pressure was when i talk about
beginning with c_n_n_'s registers is

203
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:28,370
used to denote result isolationist

204
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:31,590
closed plus

205
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,040
dot

206
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,910
preparatory house and i don't see it as
well

207
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,450
collaborators

208
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:44,970
process take the whole status for
operations errors error codes to other

209
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:48,760
c_n_b_c_ and he was going to be very
important research for us isn't isn't

210
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,790
starting point is that next instructions
and be executed

211
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:57,820
when when running at the bundy
application

212
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,040
so the stack

213
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,600
i think originally they were supposed to
be a talk about

214
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,930
buffer altadena meeting cancelled
replaced by something else

215
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:10,449
so i i like to address a buffer overflow
issue doesn't go into this as well so i

216
00:10:10,449 --> 00:10:13,009
don't know what it's like that
specifically prepared for buffer

217
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:13,910
overflows

218
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:18,960
but i did that general idea of how it
worked well and the mother

219
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,660
so a stack

220
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,459
is essentially a place where

221
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:25,680
temporary data is stored with the
applications being wrestling

222
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,240
your program is a function call to
another function all those arguments

223
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,930
that are passed all of the previous

224
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:36,200
pasti processor at cbc somewhere before
you get a new party

225
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,740
pacifist excuse for a list of questions
staff

226
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,020
he was executed and the original
statement processors

227
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,250
opera was there

228
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,190
and you returned to your original integr

229
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,780
possesses a section memory lingers
downward to lower dresses

230
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,680
iraq's eighty-six don't get confused if
you go it's part of something else

231
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,180
that's gonna grow upward

232
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:00,660
is an area that would restore integrity
don't spend some busy really abuse we're

233
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,660
conducting stack overflow tax so

234
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,700
i'll talk about it a little bit

235
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,310
this most important point at the westin
first update structure

236
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:13,049
so the last night i had to put in is the
first time that to take out so

237
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:17,439
think of it as a stack of books if you
take step multiplet an item onto the

238
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:18,210
stack

239
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:22,270
but another book understandable terms
that the only one that you can get out

240
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,320
is the top

241
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,770
prepared to stay

242
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,649
ourselves

243
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:32,570
final exit exit system basic
miscellaneous notes expenses little

244
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:33,620
indian which is

245
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,640
backwards indian union

246
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,060
commitments at work

247
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,270
so your typical thirty two-bit word

248
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:43,460
particularly if these activities are
going to be three

249
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:48,990
is represented as the three dear expects

250
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:52,350
and what will happen if you wanted to
point we try to search for strength when

251
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,400
you're cracking something reversing
something

252
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,580
you have to recognize that ok mike espy
values further strengthening reversing

253
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,640
the application

254
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,900
now most of the game of the most because
the settlers which they search for

255
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,950
strength

256
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:07,870
automatically reverses before does the
search teams picturing it

257
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,910
but don't be confused if you look at st

258
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,230
you see it back

259
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:16,130
anything less than at least addressing
modes

260
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:19,970
addresses indirect rather confusing
division number of different addressing

261
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,560
himself

262
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,700
if you're trying to get a job

263
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,620
if you're going to look at for example

264
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:32,050
host a constant memory or registered six
different ways you can address that okay

265
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,000
there's register addressing which is
specifically

266
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,880
move

267
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,230
index debated bs

268
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,070
there is a reform because interest

269
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,130
there's the media

270
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:42,920
addressing

271
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,530
which should be

272
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,630
this tax value zero zero

273
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,480
browser four zero a kickbacks

274

275
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,040
expertise reported

276
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,489
there's a direct memory addressing which
you'll see when we get into this matter

277
00:12:55,489 --> 00:12:57,990
which would be for example move website
address

278
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,390
well into next into x

279
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,589
and there's a number of other ways
indirectly dressings uh...

280
00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:05,570
indirect register addressing

281
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:08,460
which have been a state forward if we
don't do it

282
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,220
two oh one k_ talking on this because i
was getting a little bit

283
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,450
figures so that the first couple crack
means that you guys

284
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:18,350
argues basic registered roasting simple
pointers and somehow that's the basic

285
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,630
uh...

286
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,700
memory address

287
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:27,260
so those to be hopeful that we'll have
to get it

288
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:31,340
adults ought to be an inside look a
little bit of unbridled

289
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,410
when you look like there's a memory

290
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:37,790
that string of instructions or put into
memory

291
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:42,950
those drill instructors are made up of
octaves

292
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,970
instructions affection executed within
the processor

293
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,990
there's a lot more to it involving it
arouses much other stuff and i think

294
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,549
they did but to the site

295
00:13:50,549 --> 00:13:53,620
but the basic just evidence instructions
historic memory

296
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:57,590
brought into the processor executed

297
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:01,300
those instructions if you go down there
made up about those a certain number of

298
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,500
operates okay

299
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,310
that the construction has been delayed
security that's why the first

300
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:10,140
date this might be the actual opcode the
operation of the process is going to

301
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,150
execute

302
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,900
the remaining twenty four days

303
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,540
party operative so for example gil
gutknecht ad-hoc group

304
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:20,200
then you better not rendered says
register a restaurant operators and

305
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,600
register

306
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,240
battle s_t_s_ tasks included in it

307
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,000
so instruction is not just

308
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,930
it's actually one started selling it to
you

309
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:35,460
contain the operation to be done in any
appropriate

310
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,890
components that that needs to be done
are

311
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,630
uh... you personally but herbal decoder

312
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,399
directed

313
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,710
ability to pass into something else

314
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,880
quasi human readable

315
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,450
basically to reward you know something

316
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:52,690
uh... which vocal about it is he going
to have a basic understanding of looking

317
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:57,750
at assembly members inman's group

318
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:04,530
dot uploads here are some of the more
common alleles that we're going to see

319
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:07,410
and to anybody know any of these big

320
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,170
readers

321
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,439
what what they tried to deliver assembly

322
00:15:10,439 --> 00:15:13,210
they tried to look at the assembly may
get something that eg

323
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,760
okay aloo

324
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,390
probably going to be a blueprint penalty
is probably going to move data from one

325
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,140
location to another location

326
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,130
so these gloves are

327
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:26,440
usually pretty easy to to figure out

328
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,620
isn't once more this and

329
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,990
we're not talking about and that's
expensive when i did talk about

330
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,930
extensions beyond the basic

331
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,450
x_-eighty six out of

332
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:40,380
so there's way too many together get
yourself a gives you something in common

333
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,860
engineers are

334
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,660
d models from a quarter

335
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:48,880
he would be if you look great you know
people

336
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,210
easily for order

337
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:55,949
i think it backwards on the right things
outside of ebay offer uh...

338
00:15:55,949 --> 00:15:58,070
four minutes and then get back to work

339
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:00,790
that it was so important

340
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,139
so they will not only of reporter for
the first

341
00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:04,270
inclusion

342
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:07,810
so if you look at intelsat bible

343
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,810
typing

344
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:13,260
if there's a board by manuals and the
free including shipping food and health

345
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,729
site search for it

346
00:16:14,729 --> 00:16:18,000
finally understandably i don't know
enough about my head

347
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,930
but get the intel manuals worst-case
scenario

348
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,090
who proposed

349
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:26,310
involved like yourself capitalism
goodies that go to the definition of

350
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:29,160
what the opportunity

351
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,310
they're just waiting to try to remember
a young people i know that you're a

352
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,900
person who no one else is all time

353
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,680
hit the big bikinis references with him

354
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,770
and fell apart from a

355
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:43,190
yes alot

356
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:46,010
registration but they don't

357
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:51,800
sonya i actually i i i just don't want
to the site i've been using just a

358
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:58,800
for all larry work but uh... i thought
it was an income tax

359
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,989
so what would be a little over before we
actually getting to you

360
00:17:01,989 --> 00:17:06,240
doing some of the reverse engineered
we'll talk about the people out format

361
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,360
this is what does this effect

362
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,330
back in the day when he was using a math
class file format now he's been told

363
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,429
that the e-file form and i believe that
was a

364
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:18,400
wind and he'd read one that they
switched over the file format

365
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,280
since the nl

366
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,059
or article review all that you have

367
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:29,080
it's easy to lose our existing contains
different regions okay

368
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,530
those theories are broken up

369
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:35,480
typically what you see is a dot yes the
region updated redid our arts yesterday

370
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,809
which are herein after getting your
resource regions within that

371
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:41,740
binary file

372
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,280
the binary files excuse each of those
regions float loaded into a section of

373
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,659
memory

374
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:49,640
and that section of memory

375
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,520
or specific permissions

376
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,690
uh... for example your

377
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:58,690
duty might contain all of your actual
operations he struggled to be executed

378
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,270
that's loaded into memory

379
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:03,429
batteries that he's going to get for
reading executed

380
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:08,860
that you might have a second character
reading and writing but no execute

381
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,929
so these are those provisions and have
to be region

382
00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:17,680
uh... so that police certain areas be
excused appears to be rhetoric

383
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,930
and finally one other thing that's kind
of a uh... aboard dance piece of

384
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:25,910
information that was just out there for
the default format

385
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,960
is within the while

386
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,170
there isn't

387
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,710
tabletop important dressed able

388
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,890
imported rest table polls addresses for

389
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:37,909
any kind of reference that might be to
you

390
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:42,490
assess p_l_o_ or separate windows eighty
i popped

391
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,540
that is this dynamically

392
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,370
leaders dynamically loaded

393
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,770
but later when you when you go to the
memory

394
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,800
so subsidized able to have all the
references to

395
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,690
wearable

396
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,530
for the different pieces of

397
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,980
extremely private

398
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,009
uh... the reason why i want to bring it
up

399
00:19:00,009 --> 00:19:03,480
is some some more of the advanced
binaries are doing these things called

400
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,710
patty

401
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,749
which are going to encrypt

402
00:19:06,749 --> 00:19:10,450
the binary or otherwise problems did the
binary

403
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:14,540
what it does that pertains to destroy
globally important dressing

404
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,390
so when you are in fact the binaries

405
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:19,150
you have to rebuild the address that

406
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:22,190
this is the again more of the advance
type stuff

407
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:25,550
but the general idea is that there's a
table and uh... references

408
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:31,890
locations for other dealers and for
other component

409
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:38,890
for the rest of the followed

410
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:43,720
that it was all set extremes i think my
line instead of strings uh...

411
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,710
that went into the resources section

412
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:49,550
what we'll do is we planted binaries
will travel three resorts and see what's

413
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,190
in each one

414
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,140
but yet he generally against experienced
any cables i don't think that what he's

415
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:55,940
thinking about

416
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,890
by oakland

417
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,500
resurfacing

418
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,990
update is using kendra before

419
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:06,680
uh... inputting data memory space is
used for interactive

420
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,139
of this again that's not what hard at
school

421
00:20:09,139 --> 00:20:14,039
represented change based out programs
for the best deal

422
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:16,620
any other questions

423
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,680
can't convince

424
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,720
but uh...

425
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,440
so we compile a plea for help

426
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,290
it's it's

427
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,419
compiled to a preferred recent dressed

428
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:30,190
and what that means is that this is
different between different file

429
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,500
structure types

430
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,610
uh... but will itself does not come out
to a provision that actually compiles

431
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:36,030
uh...

432
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,909
with varying degrees and we

433
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:41,450
but it's actually the preferred basic
dresses the addresses memory where that

434
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,410
binary wants to look

435
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,800
because then it all the addresses with
better relative

436
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,630
perhaps a wrestling with in that binary

437
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:54,559
are going to be probably based right so
if it was the best value

438
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,090
everyday application within it says

439
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,010
within the occasion consistent what
stands out

440
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,980
is that our sources deep

441
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:05,250
consistent absolute values

442
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:09,000
it's going to do it was all right now if
you try to look at a binary that's faces

443
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,789
are taking

444
00:21:09,789 --> 00:21:12,020
the predation transportation

445
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,340
the actual operating system has to
replace the application which creates a

446
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:19,480
new base address wherever to load into
and it looks at every absolute value

447
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,909
added that the file

448
00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:25,440
and change those to be appropriate for
the new basis

449
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,480
that's not

450
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,090
best solution and that's why analytical

451
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:31,080
format will be back with more of the

452
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,050
relative addressing schemes

453
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:37,460
but essentially batteries that will
replace it business law that slow

454
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:41,840
program down a bit pretty significantly
actually self

455
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,360
as you see i'm just glossing over you
file formats

456
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,230
this life describe the following detail

457
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:53,090
that's another season passing around
problem

458
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,039
you know what to do it

459
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:57,169
i mean people really that you can really
spent a lot of time digging into the

460
00:21:57,169 --> 00:22:00,670
developer analyst to help me to do the
same thing

461
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:05,500
i don't know one-one hundredth but what
is on the slide but executive editor the

462
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,669
basic general idea he fell from her

463
00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:12,610
this your honor winners he died or got
highly recommended anybody who wants to

464
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,570
take any kind of reverse engineering
work to learn anything about reverse

465
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:16,560
engineering

466
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,870
really pulled sight sound

467
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,349
and a lot of really really smart people

468
00:22:21,349 --> 00:22:28,020
frequent goes for tyler

469
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:31,920
so far what we're talking about a
specific lease

470
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,890
binary houses or brand binary environ

471
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:38,130
binary insistence that you're going to
give you

472
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:39,909
the basics of what you need to know

473
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:42,050
to debug above an application

474
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:46,690
reverse engineering is a lot more than
that

475
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,480
if i give you a piece of code

476
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,039
you're not going to want to drop it
straight into the debugger

477
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,380
friends aircraft

478
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,630
if you do you better do it the sandbox

479
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:58,330
no that's not what you guys out there
and that's exactly what i want to do

480
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:01,260
that because i'm hoping trust nothing
about the trip

481
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,650
you know funky but

482
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,090
there's a lot more to use

483
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:06,710
to reverse engineering

484
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:09,310
then just ran into a dealer disassemble

485
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:12,570
this is a list of tools

486
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:15,530
reverse engineered views everyday

487
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:19,030
we talk a little bit about the voters of
the procedure activity houses of the

488
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,500
application was running

489
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:26,990
amador detail one of its free fall value
dot which is on the c_v_r_ dressing room

490
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:31,600
this is settlers which is used delete
morgan east edward ad listing

491
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,810
type analysis of the binary

492
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:37,040
hywell binary and breaks it up to

493
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,120
the remarks that you can use

494
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,610
it's just it used to analyze yet
patients instead state as opposed to

495
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:45,270
rent instead

496
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:48,630
the best one on the market is directed
to sell the program perot

497
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:49,799
uh... ritual

498
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:52,980
way too expensive but conclu

499
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,840
uh... and the others again

500
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,520
we talk a little bit about those vmware
and get virtual pc

501
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,830
if you get it right now where are you
getting out of the viewpoint it what it

502
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:05,380
does residents and pacify slated

503
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:08,520
delivered to a pc is not a hundred
percent

504
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,160
for different ways that

505
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,420
quote break out of those environments

506
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:15,630
but it's not easy most you're going to
return

507
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,410
if you are strictly prohibited about it

508
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:18,669
his seventeen setup

509
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:20,590
in isolated endures

510
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,190
discomfort out of here

511
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:27,529
ever bridget and i personally have not
been able to see it

512
00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:30,140
uh... so process doctors and researchers

513
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,940
this is going to really can t

514
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,290
and sis internals is the best site

515
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:38,180
for process work and processed
researched

516
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,380
you can view this is all of these
pictures coming up final accesses the

517
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,600
oil demoted

518
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,020
uh... just tons of stuff but binary that
you've probably never even really

519
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,110
had a clue

520
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:50,150
todd was happening on the other one
piece of your system

521
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:53,280
if you're not getting every person to
endorse this internals all these files

522
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,800
in in door with a free

523
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,710
really really useful for debugging uh...

524
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:05,710
evocation operating system

525
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,520
sparkling

526
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,700
oliver and i want to do that

527
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:16,830
organisms here

528
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:19,160
so you know that night and all those
little sort of there's even more than

529
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:19,780
that

530
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:24,200
uh... so passionate resident evil used
at some point i'm those occurred useful

531
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:29,030
to try to reverse engineer protocols
depending on the cross the wire

532
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:32,300
either vcd dot the sense that you guys
are using

533
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,480
uh... batteries which i talked a little
bit about some of the more advanced by

534
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:40,740
any reason a lot more middleware are
going to use packers

535
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,380
this into those unedited

536
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,989
to automatically unpacking

537
00:25:43,989 --> 00:25:45,289
contact the binary

538
00:25:45,289 --> 00:25:48,690
i think that the binary rebuilding
progress table so that you can drop it

539
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:52,350
into your disassembly debugger view it

540
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,480
somewhat some

541
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,409
acting algorithms are so dense

542
00:25:55,409 --> 00:25:58,550
and sonu you have to actually annually
impact them

543
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,370
basking in yes

544
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:02,930
this initial concept with packing
encrypting

545
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:06,850
is that when you drop it into a debugger
disassembly tool it's gonna look like a

546
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:12,280
pretty target for a car or r_t_c_
garbage exactly a productive

547
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:16,530
at some point that by here it has to be
coming trip in turn into another artist

548
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:17,999
working right after

549
00:26:17,999 --> 00:26:20,050
for run here

550
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:23,080
so essentially what you have to do is

551
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,490
progressed through

552
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:25,980
already researching

553
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,220
trickster all that

554
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:30,980
bibles congressional entry point at
which point get fish looks clear again

555
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,530
and endured by

556
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:34,730
so it's a pain right now but you
manually

557
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:35,950
uh... so

558
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:38,990
there's a lot of the packers out there
to come across the uh... program is just

559
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:42,390
not going to practice let's talk

560
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:46,290
downloads of unpacking detection tools
print for those who may be hopefully

561
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:49,320
vietnam's packing

562
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,710
uh... there's also made inquiry
constructors views

563
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,649
redistricting workers fearful

564
00:26:54,649 --> 00:26:56,440
talked about

565
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,110
impostors suffered a stroke all

566
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,279
compact talk lecture about doing web

attacking individual parameters of the

568
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:05,799
website

569
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:07,629
exact same contact us

570
00:27:07,629 --> 00:27:08,810
same concept

571
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:12,350
with an application except you're going
to be buzzing things such as memory

572
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,120
space

573
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,450
protocols

574
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:18,409
the updated with visitor worked

575
00:27:18,409 --> 00:27:22,720
application code specific files files
that may be read memory that itself

576
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,070
and there's a number of people used by
the framework that are out there

577
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,809
their time

578
00:27:26,809 --> 00:27:30,379
difficulties because they require
reasonable understanding

579
00:27:30,379 --> 00:27:37,379
growing because the different works
uh... hold something around

580
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,370
all right now this crap

581
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:42,820
isn't fun

582
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,529
so anybody who's got the cd to pass the
data

583
00:27:45,529 --> 00:27:47,320
acquire headed by our

584
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,710
what we talked a lot of rights so that i
can say discovery files dot senthil cv

585
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:54,590
provided by all the people

586
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:58,790
and hopefully a sunny distance blanket
at the end of the coating

587
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:01,510
but what we're going to get something
like this

588
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,700
you do this

589
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,559
uh... because i believe this

590
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,920
on your screen

591
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,559
sir is there anyway

592
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,779
that we can get up here at the lab
appear

593
00:28:10,779 --> 00:28:14,160
turns out not possible

594
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,520
is there is the court long enough to get
left out of your actual has it

595
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,789
are that have to

596
00:28:18,789 --> 00:28:21,730
stick with that evidence

597
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:27,570
so in the middle of the street looks
like this

598
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:30,790
might not be history

599
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:37,790
breakfast you know colin looks at the
moment an excuse

600
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:48,159
yet because my son everybody who hired
you

601
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,970
why not

602
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:56,090
and you are not good

603
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:57,710
uh...

604
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:04,660
say ah-hah

605
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:08,190
drafts of decisions you something
similar to this

606
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,290
if you had to learn how to do a final

607
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,920
opened an open up

608
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:18,920
yes they want as a personal we're gonna
run through

609
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:26,400
start so let's talk about the different
regions that we had here yeah we see the

610
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,990
disassembly

611
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:30,580
yes e one da ta cee

612
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,370
as section right here

613
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,820
over here if you look at

614
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:37,470
alistair adhered to seek the actual
registers and we talked about the other

615
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:40,220
talkable contemporary values

616
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:47,220
that are going to use

617
00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:03,870
making his laser pointer in the same

618
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,380
discontinued

619
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,730
so we talked a little over here

620
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:16,150
you'll see the actual uh... sections of
the application we talked about

621
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,400
down here to see the veteran

622
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,390
that's lieutenant i stumble but some
memory

623
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,760
and me actually

624
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,010
this over

625
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:28,920
this'll be respect in the lower right
corner

626
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,900
so it's just going to did not run

627
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,480
actually running application

628
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,560
so what the sanitation is his

629
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,260
you know we don't know if it's endless
whatever we want a crack at their you

630
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:43,210
know some some programs on a day-to-day
living like racket

631
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:50,210
sold out but it's probably best to
inventor code to register

632
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:54,390
and nothing happens and it just doesn't
work it's not returned for us

633
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:59,470
so he gets more information about their
naked

634
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:06,290
first things first was actually govern

635
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:09,649
so has anybody taking the time to go
through this at all yet

636
00:31:09,649 --> 00:31:13,350
there might be flying without any help
from the audience

637
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:17,780
option b_

638
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:21,010
when you find out the application

639
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:24,310
we want to look at it again let's look
at a little bit more closely

640
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,080
where the buses jack

641
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,720
abundances about apartments has
exhibited text box

642
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:33,160
they're going to have to get data from
right there because they have to pull it

643
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,930
into memory somehow

644
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:37,170
administrators and restoration

645
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:44,170
so now as i said look at the cove

646
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,990
oldie but doesn't really cool stuff

647
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:53,540
and overhearing actually breaks out
shocks of new monarchs together

648
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:57,590
and using the general idea of what the
actual marks is going to do

649
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:00,780
so we see here ok exit process

650
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,740
j command-line any

651
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,249
your model and all day

652
00:32:04,249 --> 00:32:07,159
this is this looks like it might be the
set-up and shutdown rooting for the

653
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:09,820
apple out the application

654
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,920
lifetime

655
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,030
low cursor

656
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:16,100
treat a window and his stuff is pretty
straight forward with this stuff is

657
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:23,100
going to be doing without even actually
looking at all at the actual rockets

658
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,330
gift message date translate message
dispatch message

659
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:32,060
create window

660
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:37,700
create some more what does a lot of some
of the tax year unregistered version

661
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,909
checked by

662
00:32:38,909 --> 00:32:40,270
exit bug right

663
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:43,760
so everybody's that's creating the
application at that stage tags actually

664
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,800
creating that book

665
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,300
the program

666
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:51,120
i'm sorry the actual windows are to be
doing

667
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,259
okay unregistered version

668
00:32:54,259 --> 00:33:01,259
can windowtext wednesday anywhere near
you went back

669
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:09,540
that yet we don't text length

670
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,470
so what is doing they're just checking
the character length of the of what

671
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:14,680
you're putting into that text field

672
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:18,800
back of the interesting by which act was
a carrot at the number of characters was

673
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,760
probably done something like that will
give you any restrictions on welcome

674
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,120
back to that

675
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,389
get wouldn't expect

676
00:33:24,389 --> 00:33:30,970
that's the code word is getting the tax
out of that window

677
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:36,000
out of the window that was built that
that explore

678
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,210
what the heck is that some funky ask
eastern

679
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:42,190
knows what their passport

680
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:47,890
all right we succeed with cracking
success

681
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:51,600
is a failure when they're

682
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,730
uh... so about

683
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:56,289
there's your from what i've been
thinking about buying

684
00:33:56,289 --> 00:33:58,730
so we haven't even looked at the
opposite with the general idea with this

685
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:02,330
code does not granted this thing is the
time

686
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:05,420
you'd have to do a lot more searching in
your typical crafts

687
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,020
of an application

688
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,889
but prefer concepts sake

689
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:11,369
it's going to look at this a little
further

690
00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:14,619
sos anybody have any idea where we
should try to break this application

691
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:17,899
we're executing at what we do have been
a drought breakpoint on their uh...

692
00:34:17,899 --> 00:34:19,039
clinton township

693
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:21,619
uh... you know how long ago

694
00:34:21,619 --> 00:34:23,429
with about thirty minutes

695
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:25,329
or so when we got

696
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:29,009
or school

697
00:34:29,009 --> 00:34:32,220
so what we need to address your run the
application we're gonna stick up three

698
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:35,779
point in their using the butter to stop
the applications that we can analyze the

699
00:34:35,779 --> 00:34:36,560
memory

700
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,209
single line by line with the outcomes
and see what is being done

701
00:34:40,209 --> 00:34:42,339
to the data that we're passing it

702
00:34:42,339 --> 00:34:44,649
anybody have any idea where they want to
break it

703
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:49,179
so one of the report

704
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:51,459
that

705
00:34:51,459 --> 00:34:54,549
forget windowtext or get windowtext life

706
00:34:54,549 --> 00:34:56,869
okay because there might be a problem
with that

707
00:34:56,869 --> 00:35:01,189
most people will drop it right out again
with the tax which is a great idea

708
00:35:01,189 --> 00:35:04,979
however this particular piece of code is
actually checking online

709
00:35:04,979 --> 00:35:07,070
first and i'm not actually burn unit

710
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:09,799
so if you drop a plea bargain to get
windowtext then

711
00:35:09,799 --> 00:35:13,109
and you don't have the right number of
characters it's never been a brick

712
00:35:13,109 --> 00:35:15,959
and it's going to come to directly
benefits one of the taxes on this first

713
00:35:15,959 --> 00:35:17,839
post

714
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,120
so let's drop it off

715
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,249
began when a text

716
00:35:20,249 --> 00:35:23,239
that to certainly is try to follow along

717
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:26,880
you go on to the line you want a break i
get up to and where are you running

718
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:32,709
heavily no doubt let's go ahead and
brian

719
00:35:32,709 --> 00:35:35,719
alexandra stream

720
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:41,319
okay so we brought

721
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:45,089
we draw the line it seems that it seems
a reasonable data uh... this detective

722
00:35:45,089 --> 00:35:45,729
lange

723
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:47,559
of the data that we had heard

724
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:50,699
so what we'll do it will go ahead and
prosperity

725
00:35:50,699 --> 00:35:53,359
lead is the problem

726
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,709
right step over there is a step into a
stopover you get used to use knows a lot

727
00:35:57,709 --> 00:35:59,089
uh... stepped into

728
00:35:59,089 --> 00:36:02,440
steps into a call so sometimes the
because it says call the southern

729
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,529
section of code

730
00:36:03,529 --> 00:36:04,770
interest over

731
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:08,030
they'll call it all and then come back
if you could step into it'll stop

732
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,779
first-line back all code

733
00:36:09,779 --> 00:36:11,519
so were on a hot here

734
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:14,269
this calling

735
00:36:14,269 --> 00:36:20,509
tex point based on some other type of
congress cut gotten sick

736
00:36:20,509 --> 00:36:22,939
richards everywhere

737
00:36:22,939 --> 00:36:25,699
let me know what's happening

738
00:36:25,699 --> 00:36:28,039
it doesn't matter correct i agree with
this but

739
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:29,999
if you look at the end of a red corner

740
00:36:29,999 --> 00:36:32,399
deceit yes

741
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:33,989
my vision sucks

742
00:36:33,989 --> 00:36:37,579
yes i did it

743
00:36:37,579 --> 00:36:39,429
five open five characters

744
00:36:39,429 --> 00:36:41,859
and you'll see what happened with that
call

745
00:36:41,859 --> 00:36:43,579
is the one that actually

746
00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:47,899
or that the number thirty seven in the
text windows is now that there is any

747
00:36:47,899 --> 00:36:50,739
acts

748
00:36:50,739 --> 00:36:54,979
and what you see here and i want to
start latest apparent he acts

749
00:36:54,979 --> 00:37:01,399
defects value syrupy antibiotics billy's
earliest

750
00:37:01,399 --> 00:37:03,169
so saying compare

751
00:37:03,169 --> 00:37:08,279
the number of characters that we put
into a lot of

752
00:37:08,279 --> 00:37:14,299
gnc if you look at your opcode little
she could i gave you is job is not equal

753
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:18,379
okay so if it's not equal that their
previous compare was not people

754
00:37:18,379 --> 00:37:20,539
return to the southern section of town

755
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:22,629
now up to you probably guessed that

756
00:37:22,629 --> 00:37:26,229
that's actually coders something that's
going to say unregistered or broken and

757
00:37:26,229 --> 00:37:29,149
you could try to trace through that if
you want to do

758
00:37:29,149 --> 00:37:30,749
and we'll go ahead and just

759
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:33,029
you don't look at that section code

760
00:37:33,029 --> 00:37:36,349
interaction went outside to go does is
exactly what we thought the part of the

761
00:37:36,349 --> 00:37:39,639
window and we've got that right now

762
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:42,599
and nothing happens it just brings

763
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:47,749
parts now when i was a lot of orders

764
00:37:47,749 --> 00:37:49,389
looking characters

765
00:37:49,389 --> 00:37:51,019
we run again

766
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:55,429
and we're back to the same place we were
before

767
00:37:55,429 --> 00:37:57,410
we compare

768
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:58,809
therapy

769
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:02,409
which is eleven which is the length of
our spring that we entered and with zero

770
00:38:02,409 --> 00:38:04,189
b

771
00:38:04,189 --> 00:38:09,529
agenda people so we're not going to job
we're gonna continue through

772
00:38:09,529 --> 00:38:13,259
so here's the section of code words
actually going to get the windowtext

773
00:38:13,259 --> 00:38:16,309
so we passed the first check the project
was checked the length of the string the

774
00:38:16,309 --> 00:38:18,229
reference if it's eleven characters

775
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:24,399
screw that's that

776
00:38:24,399 --> 00:38:27,769
get window

777
00:38:27,769 --> 00:38:31,259
he went to a test

778
00:38:31,259 --> 00:38:34,569
alright so someone point out on the side
so we just did the call forget what a

779
00:38:34,569 --> 00:38:38,549
text a so we brought that in the
memories somewhere

780
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:40,629
if you look at the long run down

781
00:38:40,629 --> 00:38:44,220
that was really weird we're talking a
little bit about indirect addressing

782
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:47,729
and using points this is using borders

783
00:38:47,729 --> 00:38:49,979
so if you read this

784
00:38:49,979 --> 00:38:51,689
it says compare

785
00:38:51,689 --> 00:38:53,979
opine

786
00:38:53,979 --> 00:38:55,829
into data section

787
00:38:55,829 --> 00:38:57,470
this funky accidents

788
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,949
to the village judy

789
00:38:59,949 --> 00:39:02,749
all right so if you look down here this
is a memory section let's look at that

790
00:39:02,749 --> 00:39:04,650
funky fax address

791
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:11,650
for ullu two three four d

792
00:39:12,859 --> 00:39:15,179
streamed

793
00:39:15,179 --> 00:39:16,549
the there

794
00:39:16,549 --> 00:39:18,869
what's a memory right there

795
00:39:18,869 --> 00:39:21,279
yes the f_d_a_ speaking appeal

796
00:39:21,279 --> 00:39:24,349
as we track of the string i entered so
now you see where the data that we

797
00:39:24,349 --> 00:39:25,979
introducing a memory

798
00:39:25,979 --> 00:39:29,559
and what this what this special
operations trying to do is to paris

799
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:32,319
the first point has been pointed to by
this address

800
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:36,579
with a valued

801
00:39:36,579 --> 00:39:40,339
thanks bill you judy

802
00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:46,829
investi

803
00:39:46,829 --> 00:39:50,419
but also included a straight line you
see

804
00:39:50,419 --> 00:39:54,299
indeed

805
00:39:54,299 --> 00:39:58,689
dash

806
00:39:58,689 --> 00:40:00,179
so is comparing

807
00:40:00,179 --> 00:40:03,019
four oh two three four d

808
00:40:03,019 --> 00:40:06,409
lesions are actually which character a
forty

809
00:40:06,409 --> 00:40:10,969
for nine

810
00:40:10,969 --> 00:40:13,079
uh... forty

811
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,790
so some very important character

812
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:16,769
against the dash

813
00:40:16,769 --> 00:40:21,629
okay so we just figured out that support
characters carbon tax

814
00:40:21,629 --> 00:40:23,959
needless to say

815
00:40:23,959 --> 00:40:26,049
if we go ahead and continue

816
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:30,479
we brought me just jump way past the the
cracking success area

817
00:40:30,479 --> 00:40:34,529
ideally far we felt that compare it
didn't work

818
00:40:34,529 --> 00:40:37,209
so its political

819
00:40:37,209 --> 00:40:39,809
change the fourth character to a dash

820
00:40:39,809 --> 00:40:41,549
gender gap

821
00:40:41,549 --> 00:40:45,899
get back down to that compare

822
00:40:45,899 --> 00:40:49,359
job is not equal we passed that personal
interest on the regina is checking

823
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:52,039
mister

824
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:55,769
now it's moving

825
00:40:55,769 --> 00:40:59,119
the white pointed to within dissection
that address

826
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:00,490
is moving forward

827
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:01,899
into the address

828
00:41:01,899 --> 00:41:04,859
for one if you look at your esteemed
table

829
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:07,609
is a capital letter etc

830
00:41:07,609 --> 00:41:10,119
so it's moving and annie

831
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:13,179
into the fourth character so i have to
look at the lower left corner of the

832
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,519
pointer

833
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:16,669
when we go to execute the move

834
00:41:16,669 --> 00:41:19,079
monday to change their capital a

835
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:24,939
is everybody's allen has a right kind of
consumed through it

836
00:41:24,939 --> 00:41:27,359
an elder statesman to another compare

837
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,769
but data spotted memory two dash again

838
00:41:30,769 --> 00:41:35,279
it's been a look at four to three or f

839
00:41:35,279 --> 00:41:42,279
so we have four eight

840
00:41:46,299 --> 00:41:49,059
okay santos comparing that to a dash

841
00:41:49,059 --> 00:41:51,689
problem because it was a dash in there

842
00:41:51,689 --> 00:41:53,279
we had i think on that

843
00:41:53,279 --> 00:41:57,299
uh... which are perhaps aren't in
evidence

844
00:41:57,299 --> 00:41:58,279
might run out

845
00:41:58,279 --> 00:42:03,859
go back here

846
00:42:03,859 --> 00:42:06,549
and we check again

847
00:42:06,549 --> 00:42:09,629
jump through to get our window

848
00:42:09,629 --> 00:42:12,980
moved in the eighty if you look at the
lower left you see dropping

849
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,549
here's our computer

850
00:42:14,549 --> 00:42:16,489
is a job

851
00:42:16,489 --> 00:42:19,799
k improvement in the lower left it's
gonna move a big capital beat where the

852
00:42:19,799 --> 00:42:22,139
original bachelors

853
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:24,240
so now we've got the first to jackson
hole

854
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,169
for thinking of the eighth character

855
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:28,899
are all bastards

856
00:42:28,899 --> 00:42:31,099
now what to do it

857
00:42:31,099 --> 00:42:32,969
wetlands look right here

858
00:42:32,969 --> 00:42:35,129
he won't wear

859
00:42:35,129 --> 00:42:36,890
funky street half hour before

860
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:38,789
and credibility

861
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:42,259
it's actually our study that we've been
modified as well

862
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:43,859
okay so

863
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:48,599
but that wasn't trying to do their own
richard yes let's put himself through

864
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:51,450
absolute max line is a moose value

865
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:52,210
zero eight

866
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:54,049
which is text for ten

867
00:42:54,049 --> 00:42:57,509
into ec acts we don't know what forty i
think we do that you love the upper

868
00:42:57,509 --> 00:42:59,049
right corner of the red

869
00:42:59,049 --> 00:43:04,899
is invalid tends dropped in these yes

870
00:43:04,899 --> 00:43:05,880
now is correct

871
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,879
ingram at the white wire

872
00:43:08,879 --> 00:43:10,969
data section

873
00:43:10,969 --> 00:43:14,239
pci-x plus four oh two three four b

874
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:17,229
uh... it's funky verse three four eight

875
00:43:17,229 --> 00:43:21,429
it's been growing it by

876
00:43:21,429 --> 00:43:28,429
tolerate so

877
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:38,119
it was just going to happen through to
adopt

878
00:43:38,679 --> 00:43:42,489
discounting something down so you see in
a series is counting down

879
00:43:42,489 --> 00:43:45,729
sleuthing something there

880
00:43:45,729 --> 00:43:49,589
does not mean that if you look we look
at a restaurant chain

881
00:43:49,589 --> 00:43:51,239
seemed to him

882
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:53,739
let's run through the air

883
00:43:53,739 --> 00:43:54,740
to devote more time

884
00:43:54,740 --> 00:44:01,740
and see weapons

885
00:44:01,969 --> 00:44:02,760
interim

886
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,379
the bite at the address by one

887
00:44:05,379 --> 00:44:08,459
and he's got this with this is doing it

888
00:44:08,459 --> 00:44:11,859
what's the string watch our spring in
memory either watching down here or

889
00:44:11,859 --> 00:44:14,949
anything like it

890
00:44:14,949 --> 00:44:19,369
what's your memory

891
00:44:19,369 --> 00:44:20,809
sequel changing

892
00:44:20,809 --> 00:44:22,170
as it was through

893
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:24,339
fits and grinding the aristide owned by
one

894
00:44:24,339 --> 00:44:28,949
free speech of the characters within our
strength

895
00:44:28,949 --> 00:44:34,019
and then

896
00:44:34,019 --> 00:44:37,430
so you can probably guess it through at
this point what it's worth its what your

897
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:41,719
appropriate string supposed to be

898
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:43,569
okay so that it looks

899
00:44:43,569 --> 00:44:46,409
the two values into yes i need you know
it

900
00:44:46,409 --> 00:44:49,699
of the numbering koreans in the u_s_
tiny uh... registers

901
00:44:49,699 --> 00:44:53,599
isn't it bobby string that we started
with the new windows with us for yet

902
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,849
and then you see are straight records go
through this modification routine

903
00:44:56,849 --> 00:45:01,979
it's probably trying to compare those
eventually right

904
00:45:01,979 --> 00:45:03,300
and here's the compare

905
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,460
and is doing abide by by comparison

906
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,189
which is what this line is repeat

907
00:45:07,189 --> 00:45:09,819
a compare

908
00:45:09,819 --> 00:45:11,789
this address

909
00:45:11,789 --> 00:45:12,969
to this address

910
00:45:12,969 --> 00:45:16,899
yes i do yard compared bite bite bite

911
00:45:16,899 --> 00:45:18,599
with an update there

912
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:20,919
we stood the kid comes to compare

913
00:45:20,919 --> 00:45:24,699
oh we don't have success

914
00:45:24,699 --> 00:45:25,819
parents at

915
00:45:25,819 --> 00:45:28,649
does anybody figure out what the
strained it yet

916
00:45:28,649 --> 00:45:32,049
or at least i get the strike at the top
leader i get that straight

917
00:45:32,049 --> 00:45:38,569
and we we looked at the entire over them
and use

918
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:44,839
right and i think we've done it yet

919
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:51,839
i heard somebody say outsiders they
selected

920
00:45:55,329 --> 00:45:59,969
ended with a

921
00:45:59,969 --> 00:46:01,959
here since it

922
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:03,539
so this section

923
00:46:03,539 --> 00:46:06,689
this is the second though that were
essentially analyzing for

924
00:46:06,689 --> 00:46:09,229
or the us relocation

925
00:46:09,229 --> 00:46:12,390
essentially what's happening right here
these two items if you look at it for

926
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:14,799
once you get you need them

927
00:46:14,799 --> 00:46:16,769
if it is actually taking

928
00:46:16,769 --> 00:46:21,339
our strength which is a mere determining
by one

929
00:46:21,339 --> 00:46:23,579
each character in the restaurant

930
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:25,579
directed at the very against this

931
00:46:25,579 --> 00:46:27,229
so i do that reversed

932
00:46:27,229 --> 00:46:28,769
history

933
00:46:28,769 --> 00:46:31,059
indiranagar one

934
00:46:31,059 --> 00:46:33,459
it going backwards just that it's easier
for me

935
00:46:33,459 --> 00:46:35,449
thirty-one

936
00:46:35,449 --> 00:46:36,539
zero

937
00:46:36,539 --> 00:46:38,779
it'll be

938
00:46:38,779 --> 00:46:42,709
uh... lapels

939
00:46:42,709 --> 00:46:45,150
except when they ask is that in my heart
break

940
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:46,529
that's been checked earlier

941
00:46:46,529 --> 00:46:49,669
guest

942
00:46:49,669 --> 00:46:50,899
doubleday

943
00:46:50,899 --> 00:46:52,799
essentially working backwards

944
00:46:52,799 --> 00:46:56,140
men can remember that something pulsar's
here is your work

945
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:59,969
necessary repair is here

946
00:46:59,969 --> 00:47:03,769
what do you know to but we were actually
built one short fifteen pages of the

947
00:47:03,769 --> 00:47:06,529
market is into the first character

948
00:47:06,529 --> 00:47:08,349
which also trying to catch people

949
00:47:08,349 --> 00:47:09,510
so it's pulsar

950
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:10,680
there there were

951
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:17,059
felicia networks

952
00:47:17,059 --> 00:47:20,079
so we have we had in mind to continue to
run through

953
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:27,079
yet that might've starts back up a lot
to continue running

954
00:47:28,289 --> 00:47:35,289
so let's try our government caps off
topic

955
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:39,449
this cat

956
00:47:39,449 --> 00:47:44,829
capital

957
00:47:44,829 --> 00:47:45,510
asiya

958
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:48,859
mccain's carefully

959
00:47:48,859 --> 00:47:53,149
accuser

960
00:47:53,149 --> 00:47:54,109
bag normally

961
00:47:54,109 --> 00:47:57,229
what i would normally do just let it run
through ticket

962
00:47:57,229 --> 00:48:01,089
will go through the level of taxes that
rubin c o hopefully end up coming up to

963
00:48:01,089 --> 00:48:03,539
a perfect match

964
00:48:03,539 --> 00:48:05,419
if it does

965
00:48:05,419 --> 00:48:06,649
here's your computer

966
00:48:06,649 --> 00:48:08,319
dubai i compare

967
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:09,879
job does not equal

968
00:48:09,879 --> 00:48:12,129
who enters the run

969
00:48:12,129 --> 00:48:13,789
current success

970
00:48:13,789 --> 00:48:18,009
we just want to resemble straightforward

971
00:48:18,009 --> 00:48:19,889
and then you have any questions

972
00:48:19,889 --> 00:48:24,269
yes sir twelve twisted cycle

973
00:48:24,269 --> 00:48:25,459
with recycle

974
00:48:25,459 --> 00:48:27,359
table

975
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:30,259
what props

976
00:48:30,259 --> 00:48:32,329
fire all here

977
00:48:32,329 --> 00:48:36,939
realize well

978
00:48:36,939 --> 00:48:38,169
if you're coming

979
00:48:38,169 --> 00:48:40,559
if you're going to specifically loops

980
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:44,679
and designed and developed a language
because i have rented a ryder ko duluth

981
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:47,799
room three times beach time changing at
once

982
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:49,570
clearcoat would look something like that
with

983
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:55,189
with a second look around at the uh...
recall

984
00:48:55,189 --> 00:48:56,889
just depends on how you wrote

985
00:48:56,889 --> 00:48:59,330
read so if you're on your program this
little

986
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:00,449
correcting things

987
00:49:00,449 --> 00:49:01,990
please don't ask for the book

988
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:03,559
at times

989
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:06,329
into the basement of g_-one g_-two
shuttle endeavor

990
00:49:06,329 --> 00:49:09,739
sold

991
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:11,490
service you're a

992
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,819
yet but if you want to check to say

993
00:49:13,819 --> 00:49:16,399
if it matches this on this on the status
on this one

994
00:49:16,399 --> 00:49:20,489
yet absolutely barbara i wasn't going to
set to you know i want to atlanta

995
00:49:20,489 --> 00:49:23,199
whatever rock one christian call it

996
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:26,339
curator which is one

997
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:29,030
so they don't have any questions on how
it works and that's what he said

998
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:31,619
very straightforward basic prac

999
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:36,149
overran

1000
00:49:36,149 --> 00:49:43,139
over them

1001
00:49:43,139 --> 00:49:44,569
class

1002
00:49:44,569 --> 00:49:45,579
hearings at the point

1003
00:49:45,579 --> 00:49:48,059
well i just know how to compare

1004
00:49:48,059 --> 00:49:49,410
enough is enough

1005
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:51,119
and it's actually scarce

1006
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:54,029
and guess that's cheating but he
certainly better than it will work just

1007
00:49:54,029 --> 00:49:57,199
fine so essentially what you can be done
to make this easier

1008
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:02,279
is essentially the line where you
actually have

1009
00:50:02,279 --> 00:50:05,839
displacement

1010
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:11,849
the line where you go

1011
00:50:11,849 --> 00:50:13,739
which he did not object but i think

1012
00:50:13,739 --> 00:50:18,269
you cannot compare there too

1013
00:50:18,269 --> 00:50:19,709
subside siteminder

1014
00:50:19,709 --> 00:50:21,439
statements to you in atlanta

1015
00:50:21,439 --> 00:50:25,219
so here's a lot of the line he's he's
gonna retire for the first

1016
00:50:25,219 --> 00:50:26,589
this is the compare

1017
00:50:26,589 --> 00:50:30,069
essentially throw uh... about it

1018
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:32,319
the cigarettes ninety upload or not

1019
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,829
a do-nothing code

1020
00:50:33,829 --> 00:50:35,869
or the comparing the job

1021
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:38,829
and it's just a slight breakthrough in
continued through the operation so you

1022
00:50:38,829 --> 00:50:40,729
can actually go back senator

1023
00:50:40,729 --> 00:50:44,269
and i think you can do and how we are
using more used to using i guess i'm not

1024
00:50:44,269 --> 00:50:46,289
sure

1025
00:50:46,289 --> 00:50:49,499
i'm fairly certain to do it and i don't
think of you know how it but anyways you

1026
00:50:49,499 --> 00:50:52,009
sent to my point is called

1027
00:50:52,009 --> 00:50:55,789
uh... filled with maps

1028
00:50:55,789 --> 00:51:01,169
her i'm not sure that we're gonna

1029
00:51:01,169 --> 00:51:05,679
instruction

1030
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:07,329
zero

1031
00:51:07,329 --> 00:51:14,329
community refrigerator if you have to do
not

1032
00:51:15,259 --> 00:51:16,659
i read about them go

1033
00:51:16,659 --> 00:51:18,529
tunes

1034
00:51:18,529 --> 00:51:23,050
so member talk a little bit earlier too
about how operations require copco

1035
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:24,809
and your operands

1036
00:51:24,809 --> 00:51:28,039
what you see here is actually this
particular out though that was there

1037
00:51:28,039 --> 00:51:30,180
that happened to our restarted

1038
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:31,920
and actually not up all of that

1039
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,110
so didn't just not a piece of the
instruction leaving the rest of it but i

1040
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:36,769
will use roberto

1041
00:51:36,769 --> 00:51:39,159
and not by all three

1042
00:51:39,159 --> 00:51:41,489
who will actually do the same thing here

1043
00:51:41,489 --> 00:51:44,799
will not back out

1044
00:51:44,799 --> 00:51:49,079
so that now we no longer have a chat
with in the code four blacks

1045
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:53,159
and if you go down a little further

1046
00:51:53,159 --> 00:51:56,949
which was lifted we've definitely do
that

1047
00:51:56,949 --> 00:52:03,949
spirit let compare justin

1048
00:52:08,759 --> 00:52:15,759
restart

1049
00:52:26,829 --> 00:52:28,130
yes he didn't save it

1050
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:32,039
everybody that how you actually have to
put it into the partner

1051
00:52:32,039 --> 00:52:34,129
could change that and volatile memory

1052
00:52:34,129 --> 00:52:38,339
and only restarted dumps out the old
code could be one there is a question of

1053
00:52:38,339 --> 00:52:41,679
the buyers seem to have to do with the
exeter or the binary just at those

1054
00:52:41,679 --> 00:52:44,079
particular bikes within the company

1055
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:45,859
uh... which you can find fight

1056
00:52:45,859 --> 00:52:51,319
the offsets

1057
00:52:51,319 --> 00:52:54,119
your smugmug by tomorrow

1058
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:58,329
axo actually what he's saying there is
modifying inline

1059
00:52:58,329 --> 00:53:04,079
were broken right before the compare

1060
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,409
actually a talk a little bit about
yankee so you can see you next week to

1061
00:53:07,409 --> 00:53:09,049
be excuse me

1062
00:53:09,049 --> 00:53:11,839
zero zero four one three zero

1063
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:13,699
which would be our compare

1064
00:53:13,699 --> 00:53:16,469
thirty-nine not perish but not to jump

1065
00:53:16,469 --> 00:53:18,579
sober rhonda compare

1066
00:53:18,579 --> 00:53:25,579
now will knock it out here

1067
00:53:30,619 --> 00:53:37,619
thanks discordant notes as well

1068
00:53:38,269 --> 00:53:41,019
houses you know

1069
00:53:41,019 --> 00:53:48,019
started up

1070
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:06,219
he just change that

1071
00:54:06,219 --> 00:54:10,579
that's he

1072
00:54:10,579 --> 00:54:12,119
that's that's

1073
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:13,599
history

1074
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:16,660
yes one of these are all perfectly valid
ways of doing it

1075
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:18,150
times more than i did get some

1076
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:25,150
struggling without debug interface

1077
00:54:28,409 --> 00:54:31,729
yet you definitely do that

1078
00:54:31,729 --> 00:54:34,209
again i'm not sure i do all this in cali

1079
00:54:34,209 --> 00:54:36,309
concern would be done nicely

1080
00:54:36,309 --> 00:54:43,309
spa rally domingo acceptors anything if
i can

1081
00:54:43,809 --> 00:54:48,459
figure into the matter

1082
00:54:48,459 --> 00:54:53,899
about these

1083
00:54:53,899 --> 00:54:56,579
rents for those not

1084
00:54:56,579 --> 00:55:03,579
and sorry we definitely pass the first
character

1085
00:55:12,859 --> 00:55:15,119
i'll see you know about all of you

1086
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:20,849
these computers as well right because
it's looking for the directions

1087
00:55:20,849 --> 00:55:26,019
just not that you know

1088
00:55:26,019 --> 00:55:33,019
not that you know

1089
00:55:34,549 --> 00:55:41,549
not to do

1090
00:55:46,189 --> 00:55:49,959
put two park street

1091
00:55:49,959 --> 00:55:56,959
not to do

1092
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:04,259
now it should have done

1093
00:56:04,259 --> 00:56:07,209
gay so he had to know about what four
checks

1094
00:56:07,209 --> 00:56:09,519
workers

1095
00:56:09,519 --> 00:56:10,930
right

1096
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:13,339
because you didn't actually reverse
engineering

1097
00:56:13,339 --> 00:56:16,700
you've described it which has for
striking is concerned began goal is

1098
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:18,839
cracking who cares about reverse
engineering

1099
00:56:18,839 --> 00:56:21,519
but we're going to reverse engineering
that's why we want to walk through the

1100
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:24,619
four hundred

1101
00:56:24,619 --> 00:56:26,650
any other questions on the first grammy

1102
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:30,339
i had no idea how much time i have
organelle teachers at greg's i six

1103
00:56:30,339 --> 00:56:33,319
minutes and goes on we're going to try
and answer any more but i think that

1104
00:56:33,319 --> 00:56:35,139
would be one of the after all

1105
00:56:35,139 --> 00:56:37,349
or what they're up to the first three

1106
00:56:37,349 --> 00:56:40,950
out and uh... in the lobby between other
talkers or other speakers

1107
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:43,820
and a product that not only the first
rate that i have done for five like

1108
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:48,789
eight months mentally to transit and
figured out

1109
00:56:48,789 --> 00:56:50,179
the questions

1110
00:56:50,179 --> 00:56:52,349
so the syllabi and

1111
00:56:52,349 --> 00:56:53,319
elites

1112
00:56:53,319 --> 00:56:55,760
purchases a lot of money

1113
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:00,519
or your poll forward where weather

1114
00:57:00,519 --> 00:57:02,699
there's another side

1115
00:57:02,699 --> 00:57:04,819
yes and no

1116
00:57:04,819 --> 00:57:06,299
period so point

1117
00:57:06,299 --> 00:57:08,859
television comes back to you

1118
00:57:08,859 --> 00:57:11,839
really also getting there are any time
permitting coat

1119
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:14,150
and reasons that none of my there

1120
00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:17,329
you'd also reversed engineered the
actual protocol is being transferred

1121
00:57:17,329 --> 00:57:21,169
back an intercept set up a proxy
intercept the response

1122
00:57:21,169 --> 00:57:24,049
the p_h_d_ depots

1123
00:57:24,049 --> 00:57:28,009
charterwest server and then the response
was that was ok go ahead

1124
00:57:28,009 --> 00:57:31,359
see my dad ended uh... number or a
spring is just

1125
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:35,739
originals as so many in a way to get
everything that you saw that it would be

1126
00:57:35,739 --> 00:57:37,369
able to open up a mouth

1127
00:57:37,369 --> 00:57:39,879
as both partners europa

1128
00:57:39,879 --> 00:57:44,959
all of the actual so so engages in over
twenty

1129
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:50,109
mister talk on the need is a slight co
first and check out

1130
00:57:50,109 --> 00:57:52,349
that something is

1131
00:57:52,349 --> 00:57:55,709
until ten often

1132
00:57:55,709 --> 00:57:57,129
is waiting for

1133
00:57:57,129 --> 00:58:00,229
some of the publisher cultural

1134
00:58:00,229 --> 00:58:02,180
what is going to go over it

1135
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:06,979
cracking it look at it without first
kita

1136
00:58:06,979 --> 00:58:09,359
representatives

1137
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:12,779
uh... i i just think reckons agreement
will reverse engineer

1138
00:58:12,779 --> 00:58:14,080
argues reverse engineering

1139
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,809
workforce exploitation develop

1140
00:58:16,809 --> 00:58:20,529
uh... actually serio of caused this

1141
00:58:20,529 --> 00:58:23,949
reacting to my overly long string
orchestra debugger

1142
00:58:23,949 --> 00:58:26,999
let's see where i strengthens and of
memory let's see what kind of appears is

1143
00:58:26,999 --> 00:58:30,549
typical of the street i didn't know what
it is too small

1144
00:58:30,549 --> 00:58:33,199
and i will try to step into the static

1145
00:58:33,199 --> 00:58:33,960
stuff right there

1146
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:38,270
so i use it more inexplicable than i do
ineffectual cracking software but it's

1147
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:38,849
just

1148
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:40,279
crazies eastward

1149
00:58:40,279 --> 00:58:47,279
to present

1150
00:58:47,979 --> 00:58:49,809
citizen briefly on

1151
00:58:49,809 --> 00:58:54,619
particulars or happy

1152
00:58:54,619 --> 00:59:01,050
so simple rent or messages the exegesis
system therefore excellent were

1153
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:02,109
people

1154
00:59:02,109 --> 00:59:04,699
houston flight

1155
00:59:04,699 --> 00:59:06,979
therein that

1156
00:59:06,979 --> 00:59:09,409
this is uh... out their own what

1157
00:59:09,409 --> 00:59:10,890
experiment

1158
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:12,649
they uh... his

1159
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:14,269
uh... water

1160
00:59:14,269 --> 00:59:16,739
insisted

1161
00:59:16,739 --> 00:59:21,049
but they didn't do that

1162
00:59:21,049 --> 00:59:21,869
depicted

1163
00:59:21,869 --> 00:59:23,169
your yourself

1164
00:59:23,169 --> 00:59:25,849
because the buyer has to be picked up

1165
00:59:25,849 --> 00:59:26,809
at some point

1166
00:59:26,809 --> 00:59:28,239
executed

1167
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:32,089
so what she did with the hardest part of
a unpacking mail and packages

1168
00:59:32,089 --> 00:59:36,229
is fine with all the o_m_b_ or the
original entry point for the occasion

1169
00:59:36,229 --> 00:59:40,159
because essentially ever does the grass
that binary

1170
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,299
decreasing

1171
00:59:41,299 --> 00:59:43,959
includes the original

1172
00:59:43,959 --> 00:59:47,459
wraps itself anti-christian collegiate
excuse perks

1173
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:50,419
so used it through all that

1174
00:59:50,419 --> 00:59:51,640
until your original color

1175
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:52,739
instance

1176
00:59:52,739 --> 00:59:53,789
uncredited

1177
00:59:53,789 --> 00:59:56,230
and that was totally computers won't
report

1178
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:59,070
that's the hardest part amulet as
americans in captivity

1179
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:01,849
super duper burgers and one on one
another

1180
01:00:01,849 --> 01:00:07,979
because i don't care inter casting
director dot

1181
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:10,119
in-house

1182
01:00:10,119 --> 01:00:14,519
absolutely absurd exhibitors

1183
01:00:14,519 --> 01:00:15,420
alright uh...

1184
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:17,180
are of a nightline recently
