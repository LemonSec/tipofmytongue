00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,250
so i'm curious lately always within
we've got a lot of people given the

36
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,899
rules to talk to the following

37
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,450
but don't wait for declarations

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,290
uh... finders

39
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:00,369
since it was is being pathetic aristide

live on

44
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:17,509
base later construction

45
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:18,539

uh... made

49
00:02:33,809 --> 00:02:35,639
and it starts now

50
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:38,449

00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:25,209
a design going to do

68
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:26,589

room i'm not quite how my game at the
moment but i i hope you can understand

81
00:04:10,839 --> 00:04:13,699
appeared calm

82
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:16,049
logging ban

83
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:20,209
well the academics of european
underrated

84
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:23,879
anyway what am i doing here out i'm
professor carter above the world's

85
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:25,840
finest thomas alva

86
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,500
professor at u_s_c_ charlotte in the
apartment purple justice

87
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,419
most of my research focuses on

88
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:33,130
cuter crime

89
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:37,090
cybercrime the weight of the internet
facilities all sorts of heat

90
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:40,530
so what brings me here

91
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,870
anybody ever computer hacker

92
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:43,639
magnet

93
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:46,580
that's what i've heard about well

94
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,289
past couple of years have been doing
research for that

95
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,380
i've been doing interviews

96
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,909
trying to get people's opinions about
what

97
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:55,740
constitutes agriculture

98
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,540
i've been going through web forms

99
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,589
and trying to develop as much of an
understanding as we can

100
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:03,289
computer hacker culture

101
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:05,419
soap are dropping presenting layers

102
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:07,029
i'm trying to address

103
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:10,139
what i've also been is developed a
certain

104
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:13,630
and serving students at u_n_c_ charlotte
in the upcoming

105
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:17,539
balkan winter semester is asking them
about their computers

106
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:20,009
what they think about computer acts

107
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:22,699
what do they do on campus but they do at
home

108
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:26,849
anything coming here and realizing that
many of you are at the very least very

109
00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:28,999
computer set

110
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:33,809
made at the same yourself to be a
hacker's me figure entered who really

111
00:05:33,809 --> 00:05:34,789
care

112
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:36,700
i know that we were all very

113
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,189
interest to people when it comes to
techno

114
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:44,219
and so act develop the survey adapted a
little bit

115
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:47,189
if you don't mind

116
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:49,749
twenty minutes to spare

117
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,430
please please please

118
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,279
fill out the survey lighter

119
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:56,569
i don't really want to know if you've

120
00:05:56,569 --> 00:05:59,100
done some sort of crazy nasdaq that

121
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,480
gestational looking ahead of their date
you

122
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,339
very very little in figure scripted

123
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:06,669
but just really why

124
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:08,259
learning about technology

125
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:13,000
what i want to understate and what i
hope that i can do it and uh... here

126
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,620
is to give you all of this error

127
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,119
get your feedback

128
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:19,080
there's some questions and they're
they're very specific why do you

129
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,240
consider yourself being actor

130
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,300
yes or no

131
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,019
and there's a series of questions after
that about acting itself

132
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:29,530
there's never any questions in there

133
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,790
and about police concerning

134
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:35,639
not only the way that law enforcement
handles computer arrived at your own

135
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,469
opinions about the city

136
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:41,699
there's some stuff in there that is not
necessarily

137
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:43,379
sensitive information

138
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:45,839
but the questions are seeking european

139
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,730
so this is a self reports that

140
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:48,619
memories

141
00:06:48,619 --> 00:06:50,669
you're writing a response

142
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:53,919
is completely obnoxious and confidential

143
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,330
at that point on areas for your name

144
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:01,280
mechanistic any information from so i
think this is gonna go disowned

145
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,659
fingerprinting lab at the f_b_i_

146
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:06,919
and try to draw an inference this is a
very very based

147
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:11,539
the demographic questions that are
master age race gender sex servings ups

148
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:13,149
for the phone sir

149
00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:16,029
so nothing that can preferably view

150
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:17,840
back to this specific

151
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,080
response

152
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,460
having said all that

153
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,610
if you're interested

154
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,520
i would really really appreciate it if
you could fill this out

155
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,909
i don't have money to reimburse you

156
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:31,159
and any specific capacity but river

157
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,010
prepared

158
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:35,869
and yet there's little

159
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:38,800
this is completely separate from any
kind of

160
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,520
investigation or other

161
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,039
not affiliated with law enforcement just
hyperbolic so by the fall they look

162
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,499
different

163
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:49,339
so anyway

164
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:53,199
ascertained let me have pencils if
you've got time

165
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,059
they not at the talks about specific
weighs in your information into the

166
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:57,959
process

167
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,360

university

212
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,850

and this sort of adapted from that line
of research at most what will happen if
