books

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:11,930
i'm introducing

3
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:14,150
right back on again

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,710
important hai

5
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,109
are going out and that's the result

all rights reserved

7
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,390
just gave us up on the fly

8
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,929
one in six

9
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:30,909
well right out there seemed to be there

10
00:00:30,909 --> 00:00:32,970
hired by a disease money

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,300
second time here

12
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,210
slip and send out hunting ground

13
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:41,080
last year eleven d nothing i can send
speech

14
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,460
over our head

15
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,460
we've got a

16
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,520
presentation without that everything

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:52,210
some of our identified micromanage
sarahbear interpreter parity really hard

18
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,500
yes

19
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,780
architects grew up in atlanta

20
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,739
is my personal project that started

21
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,450
a party for gotten two thousand

22
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:04,060
to when i went to hope their extricating
conference

23
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,259
there i suggested i everyone

24
00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:11,240
how it worked on software simulation
unethical as it stands on their own

25
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,380
that's what having an amazing

26
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,650
applied actors

27
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,760
mentality ability to

28
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,740
to today and discover new things to take
knowledge in statutory limitation that

29
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,750
was

30
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,880
you know by everyone

31
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,860
pushed down technology

32
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,420
through through the roof

33
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,520
are closing critics that's it

34
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,340
way too high tech for everybody getting
into

35
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,500
and i said

36
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,750
focus on software simulation resigned as
a big push let alone

37
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,119
uh... hope two thousand

38
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:41,479
fourteen online

39
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:44,960
decided that no one it's becoming a
little bit more popular they're talking

40
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,640
about the uh... commercial industries

41
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,750
went through it

42
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,479
uh... incredible

43
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,360
technology that's coming up

44
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,310
uh... i suggested

45
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,610
about everyone

46
00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:00,760
educate what they're talking about
technologies like about the dangers

47
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,840
also promoted sharing started at yahoo
dot com

48
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,309
that haiti zero five two thousand quite
a lot of fun

49
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:10,039
archer here i think

50
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,159
crazy ass

51
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:13,489
invention thing

52
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:18,099
interest rates and basic concepts about
technology using microwaves

53
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:19,170
uh... they're this year

54
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,460
presser pop industry because of the
backend unlikely was used in the streets

55
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,139
not interested

56
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:27,729
so i'm here today to say that

57
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:29,429
throughout the area

58
00:02:29,429 --> 00:02:32,069
i've gotten crazy but happy now

59
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:37,780
uh...

60
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,809
i started out saying it's not happening

61
00:02:39,809 --> 00:02:44,590
is that a system generated possible
happen

62
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:48,409
fred heineman analyst from a local
university that tells me how much it's

63
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:49,459
going to cost

64
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:51,139
for this project well

65
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:53,380
and uh... i'd look into adolescence

66
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,289
maybe fifteen thousand dollars

67
00:02:55,289 --> 00:03:00,169
for everyday person to do something
which backing uh... eighty nine

68
00:03:00,169 --> 00:03:03,459
would cost millions of dollars

69
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:05,719
these prices reflect

70
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,199
the greatest

71
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,639
and first just knock on the door
universities i think

72
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:14,889
i don't do it for a short clip but ready
for opportunities equipment and you pay

73
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:17,289
four hundred dollars an hour

74
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:18,399
uh...

75
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:21,659
you can come up with an experiment

76
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,959
demonstrated that a structure

77
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:25,729
game overview we'd be

78
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:27,239
not being hacked

79
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,509
we've done something

80
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:33,909
so that's kind of like crazy the site
has been updated for a while

81
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:35,449
mind you

82
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:41,129
um... when his stance on that technology
hacking is to say

83
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:42,340
it out there for you

84
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,219
winery can get quotas equipment and just
go for it

85
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:50,279
do something but obama ought to do
something share

86
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:56,319
as the plane in two thousand or was
brutally distortion and it would be fine

87
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,119
as part of the legal the

88
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:02,060
incredibly parents meet

89
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,740
but i think i think i think that uh...

90
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,760
is going to change everything is
changing the way

91
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,649
everything operations will

92
00:04:10,649 --> 00:04:13,540
eagle ability to destroy the earth

93
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,399
in created jobs inside

94
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,239
those are the streets

95
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,209
all only one other technology came close
to that

96
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:22,419
nuclear technology

97
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:24,089
technologies

98
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:25,990
is something that the other

99
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:30,149
we had a check-and-balance system has
hackers and people who were

100
00:04:30,149 --> 00:04:32,150
uh... consciences up

101
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,800
so he has been released

102
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,509
were the ones who came

103
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,149
get into the technology

104
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:42,489
do this one that we have to the warning
say is what's good for this is what

105
00:04:42,489 --> 00:04:43,949
should be used for

106
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:48,229
and hopefully enough positive people get
into it what we give thanks for the

107
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:49,380
people who signs

108
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,289
word harrisburg

109
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:53,219
fog and muggy missus

110
00:04:53,219 --> 00:04:55,869
this is my first fuel

111
00:04:55,869 --> 00:04:57,949
ceo opposed to work together

112
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:02,069
and uh... over email disappeared anybody
want to say in the comments if we get

113
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:03,169
funded

114
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:04,859
clothes

115
00:05:04,859 --> 00:05:08,020
that it doesn't hurt to have

116
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,099
advocate

117
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:12,730
anticipates at our top pretty

118
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:17,139
sandra

119
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:19,189
it

120
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:25,229
has the latest pressure big contended
that winston harmony singer break your

121
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:28,339
resume and he's going to tell us about
what's going on to the historic dear
